═══ TEMPERATURE ANALYSIS ═══
Temperature-Normalized Analysis
========================================

HVAC efficiency varies significantly with outdoor temperature.
This analysis normalizes results by temperature bins to ensure
fair comparison between baseline and post-treatment periods.

Overall Results (All Temperature Bins):
  Baseline Average: 1.137 kW/ton
  Post-Treatment Average: 1.020 kW/ton
  Improvement: 10.4%

The improvement percentage represents the reduction in electrical
power required to produce one ton of cooling capacity after
PermaFrost NMR treatment was applied to the HVAC system.
