Major Pharmaceutical Company Inc. has the problem of thermal degradation in its entire \ninventory of HVAC/R equipment.\nEnergy savings from the energy conservation measure PermaFrost NMR® can be calculated based on this study \nand then accurately extrapolated across annual usage for this water-cooled chiller.\nMajor Pharmaceutical Company has a significant opportunity to reduce energy (kWh) waste, reduce the runtime of its HVAC/R \ninventory, and by doing so create a positive impact on our environment. PermaFrost NMR® is the leading \nsustainability energy conservation measure in HVAC/R.\nThe improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at each HVAC/R equipment is solely \nattributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.\nThe in-situ energy study demonstrates:\n1.  The ECM improving the performance of any system it is installed in.\n2.

NIST calibrated devices where \nused for the highest level of accuracy and data integrity. IPMVP is the industry standard according to the \nUS Department of Energy. Because of its wide international adoption, the IPMVP has been identified as the \nbest Measurement and Verification Framework for helping to determine and secure financial compensation \nfor emissions reductions resulting from Energy Conservation Methods (ECM).\nMeasurement and Verification (M&V) was conducted to establish an initial energy baseline and a post avoided \nenergy-reporting period. The purpose of the testing was to show how the ECM improves the thermal \nperformance of any system it is installed in.\nThe improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at each unit was solely attributable to \nPermaFrost NMR®. This is a result of the reversal of thermal inefficiency on the heat exchanger surfaces.\n1.\n2.\n3.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 531, "chars": 2667, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_088_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_088_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:55e5c061d4871c7f42839149c1dd817ca14ff901ef6676e172759de962820741"}

Baseline M&V was recorded on the unit and then the proper amount and type \nof PermaFrost NMR® was injected directly into the suction side of the refrigerant loop. The gestation period \nfor the pilot was approximately 4 weeks.

No \nweather adjustments in the Post were taken due to this increase in incoming condenser water.\nThe results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:\n• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) \n• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage \n• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)\n• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU \n• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Water Temp – Saturated Evaporator Temp (CH) or Supply Air  - Saturated \n  Evaporator Temp (DX)\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 470, "chars": 2039, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_088_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_088_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:0a3aa320e1303b22d72f1bfdc7151dda82295ebf6482791a949af99ac4aaf874"}
