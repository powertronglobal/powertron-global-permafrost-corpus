HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report

The Purpose of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM

The purpose of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM is to correct the industry wide problem of efficiency loss in

HVAC/R that is present in your equipment. Major Pharmaceutical Company Inc. has the problem of thermal degradation in its entire

inventory of HVAC/R equipment.

Energy savings from the energy conservation measure PermaFrost NMR® can be calculated based on this study

and then accurately extrapolated across annual usage for this water-cooled chiller.

Major Pharmaceutical Company has a significant opportunity to reduce energy (kWh) waste, reduce the runtime of its HVAC/R

inventory, and by doing so create a positive impact on our environment. PermaFrost NMR® is the leading

sustainability energy conservation measure in HVAC/R.

The improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at each HVAC/R equipment is solely

attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.

The in-situ energy study demonstrates:

1.  The ECM improving the performance of any system it is installed in.

2. The ECM is safe and will not harm Major Pharmaceutical Company HVAC/R equipment.

Process

This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure (ECM)

PermaFrost NMR® into one (1) water-cooled process chiller located in Vega Baja, Puerto Rico.

Detailed forensic performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on this unit owned by

Major Pharmaceutical Company Inc. to determine three key elements that Major Pharmaceutical Company Inc. should be concerned with as they relate to the

original design specifications:

Actual current btuh capacity of the equipment in service with the installed PermaFrost NMR® ECM.

Actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling the units are delivering as reflected in the

kW/ton measurement.

Mechanical soundness of the equipment and its ability to still perform at or close to operational design.

Following testing, the unit was treated with the proper amount and type of the PermaFrost NMR® technology

specially formulated for these types of systems.

Methodology

The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the

IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. NIST calibrated devices where

used for the highest level of accuracy and data integrity. IPMVP is the industry standard according to the

US Department of Energy. Because of its wide international adoption, the IPMVP has been identified as the

best Measurement and Verification Framework for helping to determine and secure financial compensation

for emissions reductions resulting from Energy Conservation Methods (ECM).

Measurement and Verification (M&V) was conducted to establish an initial energy baseline and a post avoided

energy-reporting period. The purpose of the testing was to show how the ECM improves the thermal

performance of any system it is installed in.

The improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at each unit was solely attributable to

PermaFrost NMR®. This is a result of the reversal of thermal inefficiency on the heat exchanger surfaces.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)

The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the

effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces.

A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the operational conditions

of the systems were satisfactory. Baseline M&V was recorded on the unit and then the proper amount and type

of PermaFrost NMR® was injected directly into the suction side of the refrigerant loop. The gestation period

for the pilot was approximately 4 weeks. At the end of this gestation period, Post M&V results were taken in

the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same outside air temperatures

however the entering condenser water was warmer by 5.04% in the Energy Reporting Period (Post). No

weather adjustments in the Post were taken due to this increase in incoming condenser water.

The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:

• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase)

• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage

• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)

• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU

• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Water Temp – Saturated Evaporator Temp (CH) or Supply Air  - Saturated

Evaporator Temp (DX)

HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results

The process chiller has the problem of thermal degradation. The high kW/ton ratings measured on site are in

line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. The degraded equipment performance

is costing Major Pharmaceutical Company Inc. significant money and wasting energy. The equipment is using significantly more kWh to

operate then it used when it was new.

After ECM the problem of thermal degradation affecting the chiller has been significantly corrected by

installing the ECM PermaFrost NMR®. The degraded equipment performance has been restored. The chiller is

using significantly less kWh to operate then before the ECM was implemented. The efficiency summary

combines the baseline and post tonnage & coefficient of performance. This summary is the cumulative impact

of the ECM’s performance on the treated process chiller.

Cost to Pﬁzer Inc. for Lost Eﬃciency

Left unfixed, the chiller system with it reduced level of performance is costing (in money) an additional 31.6%

or more than it would if it where running at the design specification. Extrapolated across Major Pharmaceutical Company's inventory of

equipment this adds up to a significant waste in money and energy resources.

Notes

Cost of Major Pharmaceutical Company Inc. for loss of efficiency could not be estimated across the entire portfolio because we do not have access to

the average age and size of equipment. The amount of recovered energy depends on the age and condition of the chiller. This

treated chiller recovered a significant amount of energy. A portfolio inventory savings estimation can be created for Major Pharmaceutical Company

Inc. if additional information is provided.

Pﬁzer Inc. was wasting over $626,520 a year by not correcting this problem in this process chiller.

Return On Investment

The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR®

Post measurement period of Chiller#3.

Baseline Energy Consumption

Adjusted kW Baseline: .976 kW/ton * 1473.4 tons = 1,438 kW

Adjusted Baseline kWh: 1,438 kW * 6,000 Annual Operating Hrs = 8,628,000 kWh Per Year

Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 8,628,000 kWh * $.23 = $1,984,440 Per Year

Post Energy Consumption

kW Post:  .668 kW/ton * 1473.4 tons = 984 kW

Annual kWh Post: 984 kW * 6000 hours = 5,904,000 kWh

Annual Cost Post: 5,904,000 kWh * .23 cents = $1,357,920

Savings Per Year

Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Month: ($1,984,440 - $1,357,920)/12 = $52,210

Estimated Energy Savings Every Year: $626,520

Return On Investment

Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in pilot System: $16,830

Estimated Energy Savings Payback Period for Major Pharmaceutical Company Inc. on Chiller: $16,830/ $52,210 = .32 months

Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Major Pharmaceutical Company Inc.

for implementing the PermaFrost NMR®, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy savings

resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the runtime hours and reduces the annual

kWh expended in the Avoided Energy Reporting Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to

run the chiller was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of avaliable

tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the chiller at the same restored tonnage after the

PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the most industry wide accepted method of

accounting for the reduced number of hours the chiller will now operate due to the restored capacity which allows the

chiller to reach the chilled water set point with increased efficiency that will result in reduced compressor demand

loading.
