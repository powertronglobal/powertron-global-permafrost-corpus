Cost to Pﬁzer Inc. for Lost Eﬃciency
Left unfixed, the chiller system with it reduced level of performance is costing (in money) an additional 31.6% 
or more than it would if it where running at the design specification. Extrapolated across Major Pharmaceutical Company's inventory of 
equipment this adds up to a significant waste in money and energy resources.
Notes
Cost of Major Pharmaceutical Company Inc. for loss of efficiency could not be estimated across the entire portfolio because we do not have access to 
the average age and size of equipment. The amount of recovered energy depends on the age and condition of the chiller. This 
treated chiller recovered a significant amount of energy. A portfolio inventory savings estimation can be created for Major Pharmaceutical Company 
Inc. if additional information is provided.
Pﬁzer Inc. was wasting over $626,520 a year by not correcting this problem in this process chiller.
