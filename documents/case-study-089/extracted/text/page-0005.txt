HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
The process chiller has the problem of thermal degradation. The high kW/ton ratings measured on site are in 
line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. The degraded equipment performance 
is costing Major Pharmaceutical Company Inc. significant money and wasting energy. The equipment is using significantly more kWh to 
operate then it used when it was new. 
After ECM the problem of thermal degradation affecting the chiller has been significantly corrected by 
installing the ECM PermaFrost NMR®. The degraded equipment performance has been restored. The chiller is 
using significantly less kWh to operate then before the ECM was implemented. The efficiency summary 
combines the baseline and post tonnage & coefficient of performance. This summary is the cumulative impact 
of the ECM’s performance on the treated process chiller.

• The chiller should be operating @ 1,473 tons of cooling capacity
• The chiller was operating @ 1,098 tons of cooling capacity
• The chiller has 375 tons of restored cooling capacity after ECM
• The chiller should be operating @ 5.5 COP or greater 
• The chiller was operating @ 3.6 COP
• The COP of the chiller was restored by 46.1%
