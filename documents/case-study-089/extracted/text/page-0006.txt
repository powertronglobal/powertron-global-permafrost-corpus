Recovered Wasted Energy with ECM -  Chiller
The next chart illustrates the performance restoration 
the ECM created in the treated chiller.
The specific cost to operate this chiller after it has been 
treated with PermaFrost NMR® as calculated in 
kW/ton is currently .668.
Cost to Operate
Baseline Wasted Energy - Chiller
The specific cost to operate this chiller before it has 
been treated with PermaFrost NMR® as calculated in 
kW/ton was .976.
The high kW/ton ratings measured on site are 
expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance and cost to operate estimations.
