The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period of Chiller#3. 
Baseline Energy Consumption
Adjusted kW Baseline: .976 kW/ton * 1473.4 tons = 1,438 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 1,438 kW * 6,000 Annual Operating Hrs = 8,628,000 kWh Per Year
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 8,628,000 kWh * $.23 = $1,984,440 Per Year
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post:  .668 kW/ton * 1473.4 tons = 984 kW
Annual kWh Post: 984 kW * 6000 hours = 5,904,000 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 5,904,000 kWh * .23 cents = $1,357,920
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Month: ($1,984,440 - $1,357,920)/12 = $52,210
Estimated Energy Savings Every Year: $626,520
Return On Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in pilot System: $16,830
Estimated Energy Savings Payback Period for Major Pharmaceutical Company Inc. on Chiller: $16,830/ $52,210 = .32 months
Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Major Pharmaceutical Company Inc. 
for implementing the PermaFrost NMR®, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy savings 
resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the runtime hours and reduces the annual 
kWh expended in the Avoided Energy Reporting Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to 
run the chiller was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of avaliable 
tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the chiller at the same restored tonnage after the 
PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the most industry wide accepted method of 
accounting for the reduced number of hours the chiller will now operate due to the restored capacity which allows the 
chiller to reach the chilled water set point with increased efficiency that will result in reduced compressor demand 
loading.
