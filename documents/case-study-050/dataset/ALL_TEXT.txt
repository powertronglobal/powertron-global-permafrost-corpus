HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report
Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study
The purpose of this study is to verify the industry wide problem of efficiency loss in HVAC/R as projected by 
ASHRAE research and to quantify the amount of money wasted due to this loss. Many industry leading 
organizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age. 
Thermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVAC/R equipment that operates as a 
vapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well 
documented by the HVAC/R industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal 
degradation prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times 
and additional kWh consumption.
The chiller in this study is representative of a 
great majority of the portfolio of equipment 
operated by Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer. If thermal degradation 
is present in this chiller it is present in the 
entire inventory of equipment. Energy waste 
can be calculated based on this equipment 
(portfolio representation) and then accurately 
extrapolated across the entire inventory of 
equipment.

Process
This report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of one of two chillers that 
support the Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer [Texas Location] Facility in [Texas Location], TX. 
Detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the pilot chiller before and after 
the installation of the ECM to determine the impact on the three key elements that greatly affect Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer’s 
HVAC power bill as they relate to the original design specifications:
 
 
1.  The cooling capacity the chiller is capable of producing after 15+ years in service. 
 
2.  The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the chiller is delivering as 
 
     reflected in the kW/ton measurement. 
 
3.  The thermal dynamic ability of the chiller to still perform at or close to operational design.
 
Methodology
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the 
IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team was led by Commercial Real Estate Services’s Chief Engineer, [Client Representative] and supported by Plant Engineer [Client Representative] and Powertron 
Global’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer].  
Notes
The chiller tested is one of the most efficient types of chillers HVAC Equipment Manufacturer manufactures.  Both the baseline and post 
measurements were taken with outside air temperatures of 72 degrees.  
The incoming condenser water from the tower in both the baseline and post was very close to design specifications so no 
adjustments were made.
Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer’s repeatable management of the chiller plant during the trial provided more than an adequate heat load on the 
facility to ensure the chiller would remain running during the actual data collection periods. 
The boundary of the testing was the chiller and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance 
calculations is very high.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the pilot chiller to perform prior to the 
PermaFrost NMR® (ECM) being installed, as well as illustrate the amount of thermal degradation due in large 
part to thermal degradation within the heat exchangers.
 
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
 
• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU 
 
• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Water Temp – Saturated Evaporator Temp (CH)
Notes
Following a diagnostic examination to determine the operational condition of the chiller was satisfactory, Baseline M&V 
data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. 400+ runtime hours after installation of the ECM, the M&V team 
returned on a very similar weather day to the Baseline to take Post M&V measurements in the identical fashion as in the 
Baseline. The delta of these measurements and associated calculations show the amount of capacity restored.
The following IPMVP data points were recorded on 5 December 2014 using a flow meter recently calibrated by NIST 
(National Institutes of Standards and Technology) to insure GPM measurement accuracy. The remaining measurements 
were taken directly from the chiller’s control panel. The chiller was then treated with PermaFrost NMR® on the same day 
and allowed to run normally until 7 April 2015 to ensure the patented surface science nanotechnology had ample time to 
seat into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All measurements were taken at similar incoming water 
temperatures as well as outdoor air temperatures. 
The collection of the data in both the baseline and post periods was witnessed by Commercial Real Estate Services personnel and 
Powertron Global and backed up by photos. The measurements are listed below.

Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results 
Chiller Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer has the problem of thermal degradation in its Chillers and HVAC/R units. The lower operating 
tonnage and COP ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to 
operate numbers. The degraded equipment performance is costing Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer significant money and wasting 
energy. The pilot chiller is using significantly more energy to operate than when it was new. 
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the chiller in the baseline and post 
testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. 
The implementation of PermaFrost NMR®  ECM resulted in a restoration of 68.7 operating tons and an average 
improvement of 28.5% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the chiller 
throughout the year.
The HVAC Equipment Manufacturer chiller treated has a nominal capacity of 800 tons at 100% load and 1,372 gallons per minute (GPM) 
flow through the evaporator. The chiller used in this pilot was tested at ~80% load, a GPM of 1,372 and a 
current limit of 100%.

Recovered Wasted Energy with ECM - Chiller
The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration the PermaFrost NMR® ECM created in the 
treated chiller. The average cost to operate this chiller 
before it was treated, as calculated in kW/ton, was .509.
The specific cost to operate this chiller after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, is currently 0.396.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ
was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate for
a 15 year old chiller. The post results are also in line
with the average improvement savings shown over 
more than 130,000 installations globally.

Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer Chiller.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 709.4 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: .509 kW/ton * 778.1 tons = 396.1 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 396.1 kW * 2,000 Annual Operating Hrs = 792,200 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 792,200 kWh * $.09 = $71,298
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: 0.396 kW/ton * 778.1 tons = 308.1 kW
Annual kWh Post: 308.1 kW * 2,000 hours = 616,200 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 616,200 kWh * .09 cents = $55,458
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $71,298 - $55,458 = $15,840
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $15,840 / 12 = $1,320
Initial Payback Period
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot chiller: $10,190
Estimated Initial Payback Period for Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer on the chiller: $10,190 / $1,320 = 7.7 months
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 155%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 777%
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for 
Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true 
energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in 
the Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller was when operating at the original 
energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to 
run the chiller at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® ECM was installed. This regression analysis is 
the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours or load the chiller will now operate due to 
the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the chiller to reach the internal building set points with increased 
efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
