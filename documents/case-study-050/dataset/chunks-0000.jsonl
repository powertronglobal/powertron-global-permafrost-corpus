Many industry leading \norganizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age. \nThermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVAC/R equipment that operates as a \nvapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well \ndocumented by the HVAC/R industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal \ndegradation prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times \nand additional kWh consumption.\nThe chiller in this study is representative of a \ngreat majority of the portfolio of equipment \noperated by Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer. If thermal degradation \nis present in this chiller it is present in the \nentire inventory of equipment. Energy waste \ncan be calculated based on this equipment \n(portfolio representation) and then accurately \nextrapolated across the entire inventory of \nequipment.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 534, "chars": 2559, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_051_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:a7499b213364f01769730c73fab89f25a3a8b1c94518c947d1981f5119a9088a"}

The cooling capacity the chiller is capable of producing after 15+ years in service. \n \n2.  The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the chiller is delivering as \n \n     reflected in the kW/ton measurement. \n \n3.  The thermal dynamic ability of the chiller to still perform at or close to operational design.\n \nMethodology\nThe measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the \nIPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team was led by Commercial Real Estate Services’s Chief Engineer, [Client Representative] and supported by Plant Engineer [Client Representative] and Powertron \nGlobal’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer].  \nNotes\nThe chiller tested is one of the most efficient types of chillers HVAC Equipment Manufacturer manufactures.  Both the baseline and post \nmeasurements were taken with outside air temperatures of 72 degrees.  \nThe incoming condenser water from the tower in both the baseline and post was very close to design specifications so no \nadjustments were made.\nGlobal Telecom Equipment Manufacturer’s repeatable management of the chiller plant during the trial provided more than an adequate heat load on the \nfacility to ensure the chiller would remain running during the actual data collection periods. \nThe boundary of the testing was the chiller and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance \ncalculations is very high.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 512, "chars": 2632, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_051_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_051_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:f54241b9ead790ce90cf93552d93eb1149f953d0b9413cf5d5038a1336a6f113"}

The delta of these measurements and associated calculations show the amount of capacity restored.\nThe following IPMVP data points were recorded on 5 December 2014 using a flow meter recently calibrated by NIST \n(National Institutes of Standards and Technology) to insure GPM measurement accuracy. The remaining measurements \nwere taken directly from the chiller’s control panel. The chiller was then treated with PermaFrost NMR® on the same day \nand allowed to run normally until 7 April 2015 to ensure the patented surface science nanotechnology had ample time to \nseat into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All measurements were taken at similar incoming water \ntemperatures as well as outdoor air temperatures. \nThe collection of the data in both the baseline and post periods was witnessed by Commercial Real Estate Services personnel and \nPowertron Global and backed up by photos.

The lower operating \ntonnage and COP ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to \noperate numbers.

The pilot chiller is using significantly more energy to operate than when it was new. \nThe performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the chiller in the baseline and post \ntesting periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. \nThe implementation of PermaFrost NMR®  ECM resulted in a restoration of 68.7 operating tons and an average \nimprovement of 28.5% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the chiller \nthroughout the year.\nThe HVAC Equipment Manufacturer chiller treated has a nominal capacity of 800 tons at 100% load and 1,372 gallons per minute (GPM) \nflow through the evaporator.
