Process
This report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of one of two chillers that 
support the Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer [Texas Location] Facility in [Texas Location], TX. 
Detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the pilot chiller before and after 
the installation of the ECM to determine the impact on the three key elements that greatly affect Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer’s 
HVAC power bill as they relate to the original design specifications:
 
 
1.  The cooling capacity the chiller is capable of producing after 15+ years in service. 
 
2.  The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the chiller is delivering as 
 
     reflected in the kW/ton measurement. 
 
3.  The thermal dynamic ability of the chiller to still perform at or close to operational design.
 
Methodology
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the 
IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team was led by Commercial Real Estate Services’s Chief Engineer, [Client Representative] and supported by Plant Engineer [Client Representative] and Powertron 
Global’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer].  
Notes
The chiller tested is one of the most efficient types of chillers HVAC Equipment Manufacturer manufactures.  Both the baseline and post 
measurements were taken with outside air temperatures of 72 degrees.  
The incoming condenser water from the tower in both the baseline and post was very close to design specifications so no 
adjustments were made.
Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer’s repeatable management of the chiller plant during the trial provided more than an adequate heat load on the 
facility to ensure the chiller would remain running during the actual data collection periods. 
The boundary of the testing was the chiller and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance 
calculations is very high.
