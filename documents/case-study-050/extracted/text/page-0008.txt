Notes
The pilot chiller provides cooling to the main 
Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer [Texas Location] complex. Given the facility load 
and the two chillers comprising this 
supplementary plant, the pilot chiller runs 
approximately 2,000 hours or more annually 
prior to the ECM being implemented.
