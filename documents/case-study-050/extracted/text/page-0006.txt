Recovered Wasted Energy with ECM - Chiller
The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration the PermaFrost NMR® ECM created in the 
treated chiller. The average cost to operate this chiller 
before it was treated, as calculated in kW/ton, was .509.
The specific cost to operate this chiller after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, is currently 0.396.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ
was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate for
a 15 year old chiller. The post results are also in line
with the average improvement savings shown over 
more than 130,000 installations globally.
