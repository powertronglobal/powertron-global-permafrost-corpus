Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results 
Chiller Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer has the problem of thermal degradation in its Chillers and HVAC/R units. The lower operating 
tonnage and COP ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to 
operate numbers. The degraded equipment performance is costing Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer significant money and wasting 
energy. The pilot chiller is using significantly more energy to operate than when it was new. 
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the chiller in the baseline and post 
testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. 
The implementation of PermaFrost NMR®  ECM resulted in a restoration of 68.7 operating tons and an average 
improvement of 28.5% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the chiller 
throughout the year.
The HVAC Equipment Manufacturer chiller treated has a nominal capacity of 800 tons at 100% load and 1,372 gallons per minute (GPM) 
flow through the evaporator. The chiller used in this pilot was tested at ~80% load, a GPM of 1,372 and a 
current limit of 100%.
