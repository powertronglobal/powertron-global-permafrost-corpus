The pilot data was collected on the RTU using recently calibrated Fluke test equipment following the \nInternational Performance Measurement & Verification Protocols (IPMVP). The pilot data was collected on the \nrefrigeration rack system using the Clima-Check Performance Analyzer. This analyzer is specifically designed \nto monitor thermal dynamic and power efficiency performance improvement in all types of HVAC and \nrefrigeration systems instantaneously and over time.\nThe aforementioned testing determined the impact on three key elements relating to the operational performance \nof the systems prior to the ECM that greatly affect the HVACR portion of Grocery Chain A power bill. They include:\n \n1. The cooling capacity required of each system to reach set points after 10 years in service.\n \n2. The amount of kWh’s used to achieve similar set points in baseline and post periods. \n \n3. The thermal dynamic ability of the systems to still perform at or close to original operational design.  \nAwards earned by Clima-Check Performance Analyzer \nfor accuracy and effectiveness in the field of energy \nimprovement validation.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 764, "chars": 3285, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_068_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_068_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:8dce27f74efe85c32cd0f6100ffbd2ee08208193bbe1b89f7eb135a542a22ba3"}

The average \ntonnage the RTU is capable of producing under the given conditions increased from 3.23 tons in the baseline, \nwhich is 65% of design capacity, to 4.98 tons in the post or 99% of design capacity. This represents an increase of \n1.75 tons or 54.2% which now will allow the system to reach the Bakery thermostat set point faster and then \ncycle off for longer periods of time. In conjunction with the capacity of the RTU increasing, the annual kWh \nusage decreased by 32.6% as did the associated kW/ton rating.  Each are key factors in the IPP for the project \nbeing just 7.6 months and the IRR being 158%.\n  \nGiven nearly identical weather conditions and incoming WB temperatures to the heat transfer coil, no \nadjustments for weather were required. \nThe key system improvements mentioned above as well as the enthalpy delta increase of 54% has come by way \nof thermal dynamic efficiency improvement.

The average cost to operate \nthis pilot RTU as calculated in kW/ ton was 1.75 in the Baseline. When new, the kW/ton rating for units like \nthese usually ranges from .9 - 1.1 kW/ton. This means Grocery Chain A was paying 37% more than design for energy to \nrun the RTUs as a direct result of the baseline reduced level of performance. The kW/ton ratings measured on \nsite in [Location] were very much in line with the published ASHRAE loss of performance averages for similar \naged units.  \nThe restored average kW/ton rating following the PermaFrost NMR® is now 1.18. This represents a 33% \nreduction in energy costs from the baseline for every ton of cooling produced. It also brings down Grocery Chain A costs \nto operate the RTU to just 4% over design. This will result in an initial payback period to Grocery Chain A of 7.6 months. \nOver just a few years these accumulated savings will greatly reduce the eventual CapEx costs to replace the \nRTU when it finally reaches the end of its useful life.   \nOriginal Design\nEﬃciency\nASHRAE Projected\nCost to Operate\nOver Time\nActual Cost to\nOperate Grocery Chain A\nSystems As Is\nOperational Cost %\nActual Grocery Chain A HVAC/R Operating Cost\nvs. ASHRAE Historical Performance\n-40\n-20\n00\n20\n40\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n \n \n \nAge of Grocery Chain A\nRTU\n10\nEXPECTED COST\nAge of Rooftop Package Unit\n33%\nin Energy\nSavings\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 568, "chars": 2183, "pages": {"start": 9, "end": 10}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_068_chunk_0006", "next_id": "pdf_068_chunk_0008", "content_hash": "sha256:9b440324a58aa9509d992282e99e5ed6c5f1e59ef87469ca30f01306071ac383"}

The ECM was then allowed to \nwork for a period of at least 400+ hours before baseline data was then compared to the post data on similar \nweather days. \nTo reduce the impact of the store variables on the data, two similar periods of time on similar days of the week \nwith similar in-store and outside air wet and dry bulb temperatures were chosen to compare refrigeration \nperformance before and after the ECM. These comparisons included:\nBaseline - Friday 13 June, 75° Average Outdoor Air Temp, 8AM – 8PM (full day of operations)  \nPost - Friday 18 July, 78° Average Outdoor Air Temp, 8AM – 8PM (full day of operations)\nThe boundary of the testing was the Rack-B medium temperature compressors and nothing else; therefore \nconfidence in the accuracy of the performance calculations is very high.\nRefrigeration Eﬃciency Study Results\nCalculated Eﬃciency of Grocery Chain A Refrigeration Baseline and Post\nThe charts below illustrate the energy savings achieved in this pilot. The average Btuh required to achieve the \nRack-B multiple medium temperature evaporator set points has been reduced from 155,724 down to 89,771. \nThis equates to a reduction of 42.4%. The overall kWh associated with the operation of Rack-B dropped 18.2%, \nfrom 219.1 kWh in the baseline to 179.3 in the post. The input kW to the rack system dropped from 18.2 kW in \nthe baseline to 14.97 in the post period. This equates to a reduction of 17.8%. \nThe key system improvements have come by way of thermal dynamic efficiency restoration. In particular, the \ndelta of the leaving absolute compressor ratio dropped from 5.47 in the baseline to 4.84 in the post, equating to \nan 11.5% reduction. This same reduction demonstrates that the compressors are satisfying their set points \nwhile running easier. Another key measurement in determining performance improvements is the condensed \nliquid temperature (CLT). In Rack-B, the CLT fell from 104.7 degrees to in the baseline down to 95 degrees in \nthe post. This equates to a 9.3% reduction. \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 656, "chars": 2823, "pages": {"start": 15, "end": 16}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_068_chunk_0010", "next_id": "pdf_068_chunk_0012", "content_hash": "sha256:9c117ce7ffe4e0324fd920fde4fe856fbf4172aea9411b14ff80cba97f29b869"}
