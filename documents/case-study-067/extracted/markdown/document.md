HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report

Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study

Thermal degradation is well documented by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air

Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). It is a major cause of

capacity loss in Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (HVACR) systems, preventing them

from operating at the original design efficiency.

The purpose of this efficiency study is to verify the effectiveness of the PermaFrost NMR® Energy Conservation

Measure (ECM) in Grocery Chain A Regional Grocery Chain HVACR systems and document the performance improvements and future

energy cost reductions associated with the same.

Summary Results

This comprehensive report contains specific information regarding the

performance profile of a 5-ton Roof Top Unit (RTU) and one medium

temperature refrigeration rack system supporting the Grocery Chain A Regional Grocery Chain

facility in [Location].

On average, the systems showed an overall annual kWh reduction of

39,420. Combined, the systems also showed a 23.3% reduction in kW/ton

and an 20.3% reduction in kWh usage. These efficiency improvements

equate to an Initial Payback Period (IPP) of the ECM project for Grocery Chain A

of 12.4 months and a corresponding Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of

96.6%

Further details of the measurements are described in each of the specific

equipment sections later in this report. All testing was witnessed by [Engineering Consultant]

[Engineering Consultant], PE, of Energy Efficiency Consultant.

Process

For this comprehensive two-phase report, detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was

performed on each system described and pictured above before (baseline) and after (post) the installation of the

ECM. The pilot data was collected on the RTU using recently calibrated Fluke test equipment following the

International Performance Measurement & Verification Protocols (IPMVP). The pilot data was collected on the

refrigeration rack system using the Clima-Check Performance Analyzer. This analyzer is specifically designed

to monitor thermal dynamic and power efficiency performance improvement in all types of HVAC and

refrigeration systems instantaneously and over time.

The aforementioned testing determined the impact on three key elements relating to the operational performance

of the systems prior to the ECM that greatly affect the HVACR portion of Grocery Chain A power bill. They include:

1. The cooling capacity required of each system to reach set points after 10 years in service.

2. The amount of kWh’s used to achieve similar set points in baseline and post periods.

3. The thermal dynamic ability of the systems to still perform at or close to original operational design.

Awards earned by Clima-Check Performance Analyzer

for accuracy and effectiveness in the field of energy

improvement validation.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)

The content detailed in both phases of this report will first demonstrate the ability of the respective systems to

perform prior to the PermaFrost NMR® (ECM) being installed, as well as illustrate the amount of thermal

degradation each has developed over time due in large part to thermal degradation within the heat exchangers.

Following a diagnostic examination of each of the pilot systems to determine their operational condition was

satisfactory; baseline M&V data was collected and recorded by the M&V team.

Approximately five weeks after installation of PermaFrost NMR®, the M&V team returned to uninstall all the

monitoring equipment after verifying with Clima-Check that the data taken during the pilot was satisfactory.

Regarding the RTU, the team was also careful to return for post measurements on a similar weather day to the

baseline so the effects on the condensing coils would be consistent. The delta of these measurements and the

associated calculations demonstrate the amount of improvement the ECM had across both systems.

The following report is produced through the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan.

The results tracked by the Clima-Check Performance Analyzer as well as the results manually recorded

(and photographed) on the RTU using the Fluke test equipment were entered into the following

thermodynamic engineering formulas:

• kWh= kW * Runtime Hours

• Thermal Transfer Delta T = Evap Temp Leaving – Returning Refrigerant Temp

• Amps = direct collection showing amount of work the compressor is doing

• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor * √3 / 1000

• kW/Ton = kW consumed / actual measured tonnage

Grocery Chain A is Saving More than just Energy

By treating just one RTU and the Rack-B medium temp refrigeration system in the Grocery Chain A Regional Grocery Chain store in

[Location] with PermaFrost NMR® and based on the current manner in which Grocery Chain A and REMCO

operate these systems, Grocery Chain A will save approximately 39,420 kWh per year and all the costs associated with

those savings. From an environmental impact standpoint, Grocery Chain A is also benefitting the surrounding

Maryland communities. The environmental impact would be significant with an implementation of

PermaFrost NMR® across the entire Regional Grocery Chain portfolio.

The 39,420 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 27.2 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from

being released or any of the following:

RTU Testing Methodology

For this portion of the pilot, measurement data was collected prior to the RTU being treated with the

PermaFrost NMR® ECM on 6 June 2014. PermaFrost NMR® was then allowed to work for a period of at least

400+ hours before the post measurements were taken on a similar weather day and then compared to the

baseline data.

To reduce the impact of the store variables on the data, care was taken to have similar outside air temperatures

affecting the ability of the condensing coils to reject heat as well as similar entering wet bulb and dry bulb

temperatures. With these three conditions accomplished and the boundary of the test being the RTU itself, the

confidence level in the resulting data in very high.

For the RTU phase, the comparisons included testing conducted on the days listed below:

Baseline -  Friday 6 June, Outside Air Temp of 75°, Entering DB of 71.4°, Entering WB of 56.9°

Post - Friday 1 August, Outside Air Temp of 75°, Entering DB of 70.3°, Entering WB of 56.7°

The boundary of the testing was the RTU and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the

performance calculations is very high.

HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results

Calculated Eﬃciency of Grocery Chain A RTU Baseline and Post

The chart on the next page illustrates the energy savings achieved in this RTU phase of the pilot. The average

tonnage the RTU is capable of producing under the given conditions increased from 3.23 tons in the baseline,

which is 65% of design capacity, to 4.98 tons in the post or 99% of design capacity. This represents an increase of

1.75 tons or 54.2% which now will allow the system to reach the Bakery thermostat set point faster and then

cycle off for longer periods of time. In conjunction with the capacity of the RTU increasing, the annual kWh

usage decreased by 32.6% as did the associated kW/ton rating.  Each are key factors in the IPP for the project

being just 7.6 months and the IRR being 158%.

Given nearly identical weather conditions and incoming WB temperatures to the heat transfer coil, no

adjustments for weather were required.

The key system improvements mentioned above as well as the enthalpy delta increase of 54% has come by way

of thermal dynamic efficiency improvement. This demonstrates how much work is being done and/or heat is

being absorbed through the coil and into the refrigerant.

HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results

Cost to Regional Grocery Chain to Operate the RTU Baseline vs Post

The next chart illustrates just how much money the efficiency performance loss in the pilot RTU was costing

Grocery Chain A in the way of wasted energy each month it was operating prior to the ECM. The average cost to operate

this pilot RTU as calculated in kW/ ton was 1.75 in the Baseline. When new, the kW/ton rating for units like

these usually ranges from .9 - 1.1 kW/ton. This means Grocery Chain A was paying 37% more than design for energy to

run the RTUs as a direct result of the baseline reduced level of performance. The kW/ton ratings measured on

site in [Location] were very much in line with the published ASHRAE loss of performance averages for similar

aged units.

The restored average kW/ton rating following the PermaFrost NMR® is now 1.18. This represents a 33%

reduction in energy costs from the baseline for every ton of cooling produced. It also brings down Grocery Chain A costs

to operate the RTU to just 4% over design. This will result in an initial payback period to Grocery Chain A of 7.6 months.

Over just a few years these accumulated savings will greatly reduce the eventual CapEx costs to replace the

RTU when it finally reaches the end of its useful life.

Energy Consumption Baseline Vs Post

The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR®

Post measurement period for the Grocery Chain A pilot RTU.

Baseline Energy Consumption of RTU

Adjusted kW Baseline: 1.75 kW/ton * 4.98 tons = 8.72 kW

Adjusted Baseline kWh: 8.72 kW * 3,650 Annual Operating Hrs = 31,828 kWh

Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 31,828 kWh * $.095 = $3,024

Post Energy Consumption of RTU

Adjusted Post Tonnage: 4.98

kW Post: 1.18 kW/ton * 4.98 tons = 5.88 kW

Annual kWh Post: 5.88 kW * 3,650 hours = 21,462 kWh

Annual Cost Post: 21,462 kWh * .095 cents = $ 2,039

Savings Per Year on RTU

Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $3,024 - $2,039 = $ 985

Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period

for Grocery Chain A for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true

energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended

in the Avoided Energy Reporting (Post) Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems

was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity

and then subtracting the revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR®

ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number

of hours the systems will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the

internal building set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.

Rack-B Refrigeration Testing Methodology

For this portion of the pilot, measurement data was collected using the Clima-Check Performance Analyzer

prior to Rack-B being treated with the PermaFrost NMR® ECM on 18 June 2014. The ECM was then allowed to

work for a period of at least 400+ hours before baseline data was then compared to the post data on similar

weather days.

To reduce the impact of the store variables on the data, two similar periods of time on similar days of the week

with similar in-store and outside air wet and dry bulb temperatures were chosen to compare refrigeration

performance before and after the ECM. These comparisons included:

Baseline - Friday 13 June, 75° Average Outdoor Air Temp, 8AM – 8PM (full day of operations)

Post - Friday 18 July, 78° Average Outdoor Air Temp, 8AM – 8PM (full day of operations)

The boundary of the testing was the Rack-B medium temperature compressors and nothing else; therefore

confidence in the accuracy of the performance calculations is very high.

Refrigeration Eﬃciency Study Results

Calculated Eﬃciency of Grocery Chain A Refrigeration Baseline and Post

The charts below illustrate the energy savings achieved in this pilot. The average Btuh required to achieve the

Rack-B multiple medium temperature evaporator set points has been reduced from 155,724 down to 89,771.

This equates to a reduction of 42.4%. The overall kWh associated with the operation of Rack-B dropped 18.2%,

from 219.1 kWh in the baseline to 179.3 in the post. The input kW to the rack system dropped from 18.2 kW in

the baseline to 14.97 in the post period. This equates to a reduction of 17.8%.

The key system improvements have come by way of thermal dynamic efficiency restoration. In particular, the

delta of the leaving absolute compressor ratio dropped from 5.47 in the baseline to 4.84 in the post, equating to

an 11.5% reduction. This same reduction demonstrates that the compressors are satisfying their set points

while running easier. Another key measurement in determining performance improvements is the condensed

liquid temperature (CLT). In Rack-B, the CLT fell from 104.7 degrees to in the baseline down to 95 degrees in

the post. This equates to a 9.3% reduction.

Recovered Wasted Energy with ECM

The chart to the right illustrates the performance

restoration the ECM created in the treated Rack-B.

The average cost to operate this Rack system before

it was treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated

in kW/ton, was 1.41.

The specific cost to operate Rack-B after it was

treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in

kW/ton, is currently 1.15. This equates to an 18.4%

reduction in kW/ton.

The delta of the refrigeration kW/ton ratings measured in-situ were expected as they fell within the

average improvement savings shown over more than 125,000 installations globally.

Energy Consumption Baseline Vs Post

The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR®

Post measurement period for the Grocery Chain A pilot Med Temp Rack-B.

Baseline Energy Consumption of Med Temp Rack-B

Baseline kWh as Measured Over 12 Hours: 219.1 kWh

Cost to Run Baseline: 219.1 kWh * $.095 * 365 * 2 = $15,194.59

Post Energy Consumption of Med Temp Rack-B

Post kWh Post as Measured Over 12 Hours: 179.3kWh

Cost to Run Post: 179.3 kWh * $.095 *365 * 2 = $12,434.46

Savings Per Year on Med Temp Rack-B

Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $15,194.59 - $12,434.46 = $2,760.13

The savings above is strictly based on reduced measured kWh over similar 12 hour periods and then extrapolated out

over an entire year. The efficiency gains and capacity restoration achieved in Rack-B may also allow Grocery Chain A to install

an additional perishable food case off of Rack-B under its current configuration simply by tapping off the current

piping.
