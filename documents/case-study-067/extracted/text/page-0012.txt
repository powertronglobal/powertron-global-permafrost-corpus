Recovered Wasted Energy with ECM
The chart to the right illustrates the performance
restoration the ECM created in the treated RTU.
The average cost to operate the RTU before 
it was treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as 
calculated in kW/ton, was 1.75.
The specific cost to operate the RTU after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, is currently 1.18. This equates to a 32.6%
reduction in kW/ton.  New RTU’s similar to the 
pilot equipment have kW/ton ratings averaging
between 1.0 and 1.1.
The delta of the RTU kW/ton ratings measured in-situ 
were expected as they fell within the average 
improvement savings shown over more than 125,000 
installations globally.
