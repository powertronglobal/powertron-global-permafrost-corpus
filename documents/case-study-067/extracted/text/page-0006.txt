Grocery Chain A is Saving More than just Energy
By treating just one RTU and the Rack-B medium temp refrigeration system in the Grocery Chain A Regional Grocery Chain store in 
[Location] with PermaFrost NMR® and based on the current manner in which Grocery Chain A and REMCO 
operate these systems, Grocery Chain A will save approximately 39,420 kWh per year and all the costs associated with 
those savings. From an environmental impact standpoint, Grocery Chain A is also benefitting the surrounding 
Maryland communities. The environmental impact would be significant with an implementation of 
PermaFrost NMR® across the entire Regional Grocery Chain portfolio.
The 39,420 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 27.2 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from 
being released or any of the following:
