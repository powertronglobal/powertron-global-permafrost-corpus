HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report
Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study
Thermal degradation is well documented by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air 
Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). It is a major cause of 
capacity loss in Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (HVACR) systems, preventing them 
from operating at the original design efficiency. 
The purpose of this efficiency study is to verify the effectiveness of the PermaFrost NMR® Energy Conservation 
Measure (ECM) in Grocery Chain A Regional Grocery Chain HVACR systems and document the performance improvements and future 
energy cost reductions associated with the same.  
Summary Results
This comprehensive report contains specific information regarding the 
performance profile of a 5-ton Roof Top Unit (RTU) and one medium 
temperature refrigeration rack system supporting the Grocery Chain A Regional Grocery Chain 
facility in [Location].
On average, the systems showed an overall annual kWh reduction of 
39,420. Combined, the systems also showed a 23.3% reduction in kW/ton 
and an 20.3% reduction in kWh usage. These efficiency improvements 
equate to an Initial Payback Period (IPP) of the ECM project for Grocery Chain A 
of 12.4 months and a corresponding Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 
96.6%  
Further details of the measurements are described in each of the specific 
equipment sections later in this report. All testing was witnessed by [Engineering Consultant] 
[Engineering Consultant], PE, of Energy Efficiency Consultant.
