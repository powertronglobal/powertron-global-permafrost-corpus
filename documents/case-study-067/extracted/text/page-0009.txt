HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Calculated Eﬃciency of Grocery Chain A RTU Baseline and Post
The chart on the next page illustrates the energy savings achieved in this RTU phase of the pilot. The average 
tonnage the RTU is capable of producing under the given conditions increased from 3.23 tons in the baseline, 
which is 65% of design capacity, to 4.98 tons in the post or 99% of design capacity. This represents an increase of 
1.75 tons or 54.2% which now will allow the system to reach the Bakery thermostat set point faster and then 
cycle off for longer periods of time. In conjunction with the capacity of the RTU increasing, the annual kWh 
usage decreased by 32.6% as did the associated kW/ton rating.  Each are key factors in the IPP for the project 
being just 7.6 months and the IRR being 158%.
  
Given nearly identical weather conditions and incoming WB temperatures to the heat transfer coil, no 
adjustments for weather were required. 
The key system improvements mentioned above as well as the enthalpy delta increase of 54% has come by way 
of thermal dynamic efficiency improvement. This demonstrates how much work is being done and/or heat is 
being absorbed through the coil and into the refrigerant.
