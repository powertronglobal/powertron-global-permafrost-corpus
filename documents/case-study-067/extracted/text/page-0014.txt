Notes
This particular RTU provides cooling to the 
store Bakery. It is estimated the system ran 
approximately 3,650 hours annually prior to 
the ECM being implemented. 
Images to the right are the measured Entering 
and Leaving WB/DB readings directly across 
the evaporator coil in the baseline (left) and 
post (right) data collection periods.
