Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content detailed in both phases of this report will first demonstrate the ability of the respective systems to 
perform prior to the PermaFrost NMR® (ECM) being installed, as well as illustrate the amount of thermal 
degradation each has developed over time due in large part to thermal degradation within the heat exchangers.
 
Following a diagnostic examination of each of the pilot systems to determine their operational condition was 
satisfactory; baseline M&V data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. 
Approximately five weeks after installation of PermaFrost NMR®, the M&V team returned to uninstall all the 
monitoring equipment after verifying with Clima-Check that the data taken during the pilot was satisfactory. 
Regarding the RTU, the team was also careful to return for post measurements on a similar weather day to the 
baseline so the effects on the condensing coils would be consistent. The delta of these measurements and the 
associated calculations demonstrate the amount of improvement the ECM had across both systems.
The following report is produced through the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. 
The results tracked by the Clima-Check Performance Analyzer as well as the results manually recorded 
(and photographed) on the RTU using the Fluke test equipment were entered into the following 
thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
• kWh= kW * Runtime Hours
 
• Thermal Transfer Delta T = Evap Temp Leaving – Returning Refrigerant Temp
 
• Amps = direct collection showing amount of work the compressor is doing 
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor * √3 / 1000
 
• kW/Ton = kW consumed / actual measured tonnage
