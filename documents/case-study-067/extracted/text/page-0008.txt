RTU Testing Methodology
For this portion of the pilot, measurement data was collected prior to the RTU being treated with the 
PermaFrost NMR® ECM on 6 June 2014. PermaFrost NMR® was then allowed to work for a period of at least 
400+ hours before the post measurements were taken on a similar weather day and then compared to the 
baseline data.
  
To reduce the impact of the store variables on the data, care was taken to have similar outside air temperatures 
affecting the ability of the condensing coils to reject heat as well as similar entering wet bulb and dry bulb 
temperatures. With these three conditions accomplished and the boundary of the test being the RTU itself, the 
confidence level in the resulting data in very high. 
For the RTU phase, the comparisons included testing conducted on the days listed below:
Baseline -  Friday 6 June, Outside Air Temp of 75°, Entering DB of 71.4°, Entering WB of 56.9° 
Post - Friday 1 August, Outside Air Temp of 75°, Entering DB of 70.3°, Entering WB of 56.7°
The boundary of the testing was the RTU and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the 
performance calculations is very high.
