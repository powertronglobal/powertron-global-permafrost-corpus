Process
For this comprehensive two-phase report, detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was 
performed on each system described and pictured above before (baseline) and after (post) the installation of the 
ECM. The pilot data was collected on the RTU using recently calibrated Fluke test equipment following the 
International Performance Measurement & Verification Protocols (IPMVP). The pilot data was collected on the 
refrigeration rack system using the Clima-Check Performance Analyzer. This analyzer is specifically designed 
to monitor thermal dynamic and power efficiency performance improvement in all types of HVAC and 
refrigeration systems instantaneously and over time.
The aforementioned testing determined the impact on three key elements relating to the operational performance 
of the systems prior to the ECM that greatly affect the HVACR portion of Grocery Chain A power bill. They include:
 
1. The cooling capacity required of each system to reach set points after 10 years in service.
 
2. The amount of kWh’s used to achieve similar set points in baseline and post periods. 
 
3. The thermal dynamic ability of the systems to still perform at or close to original operational design.  
Awards earned by Clima-Check Performance Analyzer 
for accuracy and effectiveness in the field of energy 
improvement validation.
