Energy Consumption Baseline Vs Post
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the Grocery Chain A pilot RTU.
Baseline Energy Consumption of RTU
Adjusted kW Baseline: 1.75 kW/ton * 4.98 tons = 8.72 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 8.72 kW * 3,650 Annual Operating Hrs = 31,828 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 31,828 kWh * $.095 = $3,024       
Post Energy Consumption of RTU
Adjusted Post Tonnage: 4.98
kW Post: 1.18 kW/ton * 4.98 tons = 5.88 kW
Annual kWh Post: 5.88 kW * 3,650 hours = 21,462 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 21,462 kWh * .095 cents = $ 2,039
Savings Per Year on RTU
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $3,024 - $2,039 = $ 985              
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period 
for Grocery Chain A for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true 
energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended 
in the Avoided Energy Reporting (Post) Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems 
was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity 
and then subtracting the revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® 
ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number 
of hours the systems will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the 
internal building set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
