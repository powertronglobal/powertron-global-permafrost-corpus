HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Cost to Regional Grocery Chain to Operate the RTU Baseline vs Post
The next chart illustrates just how much money the efficiency performance loss in the pilot RTU was costing 
Grocery Chain A in the way of wasted energy each month it was operating prior to the ECM. The average cost to operate 
this pilot RTU as calculated in kW/ ton was 1.75 in the Baseline. When new, the kW/ton rating for units like 
these usually ranges from .9 - 1.1 kW/ton. This means Grocery Chain A was paying 37% more than design for energy to 
run the RTUs as a direct result of the baseline reduced level of performance. The kW/ton ratings measured on 
site in [Location] were very much in line with the published ASHRAE loss of performance averages for similar 
aged units.  
The restored average kW/ton rating following the PermaFrost NMR® is now 1.18. This represents a 33% 
reduction in energy costs from the baseline for every ton of cooling produced. It also brings down Grocery Chain A costs 
to operate the RTU to just 4% over design. This will result in an initial payback period to Grocery Chain A of 7.6 months. 
Over just a few years these accumulated savings will greatly reduce the eventual CapEx costs to replace the 
RTU when it finally reaches the end of its useful life.
