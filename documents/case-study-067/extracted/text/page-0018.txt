Recovered Wasted Energy with ECM
The chart to the right illustrates the performance
restoration the ECM created in the treated Rack-B.   
The average cost to operate this Rack system before 
it was treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated 
in kW/ton, was 1.41.
The specific cost to operate Rack-B after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, is currently 1.15. This equates to an 18.4%
reduction in kW/ton.
The delta of the refrigeration kW/ton ratings measured in-situ were expected as they fell within the 
average improvement savings shown over more than 125,000 installations globally.  
Energy Consumption Baseline Vs Post
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the Grocery Chain A pilot Med Temp Rack-B.
Baseline Energy Consumption of Med Temp Rack-B
Baseline kWh as Measured Over 12 Hours: 219.1 kWh
Cost to Run Baseline: 219.1 kWh * $.095 * 365 * 2 = $15,194.59
Post Energy Consumption of Med Temp Rack-B
Post kWh Post as Measured Over 12 Hours: 179.3kWh
Cost to Run Post: 179.3 kWh * $.095 *365 * 2 = $12,434.46
Savings Per Year on Med Temp Rack-B
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $15,194.59 - $12,434.46 = $2,760.13
The savings above is strictly based on reduced measured kWh over similar 12 hour periods and then extrapolated out 
over an entire year. The efficiency gains and capacity restoration achieved in Rack-B may also allow Grocery Chain A to install 
an additional perishable food case off of Rack-B under its current configuration simply by tapping off the current 
piping.
