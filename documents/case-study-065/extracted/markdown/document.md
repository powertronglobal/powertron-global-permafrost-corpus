Energy Savings Project Report

Executive Summary

Property Management Company C’s International Site A Chiller #1 and #2 suffered extensive thermal degradation due to thermal inefficiency,

with corresponding degraded performance wasting significant amounts of money on wasted energy

consumption. The high kilowatt Energy to kilowatt Refrigeration (kWE/kWR) ratio measured in situ was in

line with ASHRAE defined performance loss and operating cost parameters.

The thermal degradation problem affecting the chillers was corrected by a single treatment of the energy

conservation method (ECM) PermaFrost NMR® nano-technology from Powertron Global®.  It very quickly and

effectively restored the chillers’ performance by utilising significantly less electrical power to operate than

before the ECM implementation. The International Site A Chillers #1 and #2 PermaFrost NMR® Project once again

demonstrated that the ECM PermaFrost NMR® improves performance and is safe and harmless to any

Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (HVACR) system.

PermaFrost NMR® has been installed in more than 120,000 HVACR systems around the world since it was

first introduced in 2002 without a single failure or liability claim against the technology.

The performance improvements and energy savings were:

The Purpose and Process of the Energy Savings Project

This report contains specific information regarding the PermaFrost NMR® ECM treatment of two HVAC Equipment Manufacturer

RTHB300 screw chillers located at Property Management Company C of Pretoria’s International Site A.

Property Management Company C suffered thermal degradation in its International Site A chillers, as it does throughout its entire

portfolio of HVACR equipment. It took the opportunity during late 2013/early 2014 to lower its excessive

HVACR inventory runtime, and by doing so reduce energy waste, thereby creating a positive impact on our

environment.

The purpose of PermaFrost NMR® nanotechnology as an Energy Conservation Measure (ECM) is to correct

the Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (HVACR) industry-wide problem of efficiency

loss that exists within vapour compression systems utilising oil and refrigerant ~ commonly referred to as

thermal degredation.

Participants included Engineering Consultant A Managing Director, [Client Representative] Pr. Eng.; [Senior Energy Engineer] Pr. Eng., Chief

Forensic Mechanical Engineer and Director of Engineering for Powertron Global; under the direction of

[Consulting P.E.], Pr. Technical Engineer MSAIEE, Property Management Company C.

A diagnostic examination of Chiller #2 and then #1 pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the

operational conditions of the systems were satisfactory. Testing was executed on the systems to determine key

elements that Property Management Company C were concerned with relating to their chillers’ original design specifications:

• Current BTUH capacity of the equipment in service without and then with the installed

PermaFrost NMR® ECM.

• Actual Power Cost to deliver the chillers’ required cooling amount reflected in kWE/kWR

measurement.

• Mechanical soundness of the chillers and their ability to continue performing at, or close to,

operational design.

Following the operational condition testing, Measurement and Verification (M&V) was conducted on Chiller

#2 and then Chiller #1. A Baseline M&V was recorded and then the proper amount and specific type of

PermaFrost NMR® technology, specially formulated for this type of system, was injected directly into the

suction side of the evaporator barrel. The gestation period for each chiller was approximately six to ten (6-10)

weeks. At the end of this gestation period, a post Avoided Energy-Reporting Period (AERP) M&V was

recorded in the identical manner as the Baseline, taking special care to match the same motor amperage load,

flow and entering condenser water temperature. The purpose of the testing was to show how the ECM

improves the thermal performance of any system it is installed in, typically after 400 minimum runtime hours,

between the Baseline and AERP measurements.

Efficiency improvement and restored capacity gained directly at each piece of HVACR equipment treated

with substantial resultant energy savings is solely attributable to PermaFrost NMR®, the leading sustainable

ECM in the HVACR industry.

The results were formulated by applying the measured data results into the following thermodynamic

engineering formulae:

• kW = Volts*Amps*Power Factor *√3/1000 (for 3-Phase)

• kWE/kWR = Actual kWEnergy/Actual kWRefrigeration

• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = 1/( kWE/kWR)

• Delta-T = Chilled Water Evaporator Leaving – Entering Temperature

• Actual Capacity = Evaporator Water Flow Rate*1*Chilled Water Delta-T *4.185

Engineering Notes

Evaporator Flow Rate was operating at 143.36% of design during the pre and post testing, which resulted in the higher

than normal capacity readings for Chiller #2. The goal of the technology is to improve the thermal transfer therefore as

long as the flow rates are the same during the pre and post periods, the improvement percentage will remain the same.

The focus of the pilot is on the improvement delta.  This percentage improvement can be used to project savings if the flow

rates are held constant. Upon correction of flow in the evaporator to levels suggested by the manufacturer additional

increases in thermal energy transfer will be apparent. This will deliver to the client, increased energy efficiencies and

system capacity. While there could be some energy efficiencies regarding pump energy it will be negligible and pump

energy was not considered due to the boundary of the measurement of the chiller.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation (M&V)
of the Energy Savings Project

The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected, compiled and verified in accordance

with the International Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) framework using National Institutes

of Standards & Technology (NIST) calibrated devices for the highest level of accuracy and data integrity.

IPMVP, developed by hundreds of organizations and executives from over 25 countries, provides consensus

best practices for measuring and verifying renewable energy performance. It is the industry standard for

Eskom. Because of its wide international adoption, it has been identified as the best Measurement and

Verification (M&V) Framework to determine emission reductions and secure financial compensation resulting

from Energy Conservation Methods (ECM).

Cost to Property Management Company C for Lost Eﬃciency

Left untreated, the chillers’ annual additional monetary cost with their reduced level of performance would be

23.44% or R168,136 for Chiller #1, and 21.11% or R117,843 for Chiller #2. Extrapolated across all Property Management Company C’s

HVACR portfolio, this total 259,980 kilowatts at a cost of R285,979 for just two chillers adds up to a significant

waste of money on wasted energy.

Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period

for Property Management Company C for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate

the true energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh

expended in the Avoided Energy Reporting Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run

the chiller was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage

capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the chiller at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost

NMR® ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the most industry wide accepted method of accounting for the

reduced number of hours the chiller will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the

chiller to reach the chilled water set point with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
