Conclusion

performance factors of their International Site A chillers is only the initial step in attaining a world-class climate 
control environment. A detailed forensic audit of their entire system and its initial design, including all DX 
units, air handler units (AHU) and pumps, with full water balance undertaken, is being conducted by their 
HVACR consultants prior to implementing variable speed drives (VSD) and an online building 
management system (Pharma Company B).
