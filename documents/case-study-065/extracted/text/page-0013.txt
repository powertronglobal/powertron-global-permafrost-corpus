Annual kWh ERP: 124.14 kWE * 3,040 hours = 377,386 kWh
Annual Cost ERP: 377,386 kWh * ZAR 1.10 = ZAR 415,124
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy kWh (savings) Per Year: 484,515 – 377,386 = 107,129 kWh
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: ZAR 532,967 – ZAR 415,125 = ZAR 107,129
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: ZAR 107,129 / 12 = ZAR 8,927
