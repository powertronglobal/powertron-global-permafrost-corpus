Energy Savings Project Report
Executive Summary 
Property Management Company C’s International Site A Chiller #1 and #2 suffered extensive thermal degradation due to thermal inefficiency, 
with corresponding degraded performance wasting significant amounts of money on wasted energy 
consumption. The high kilowatt Energy to kilowatt Refrigeration (kWE/kWR) ratio measured in situ was in 
line with ASHRAE defined performance loss and operating cost parameters. 
The thermal degradation problem affecting the chillers was corrected by a single treatment of the energy 
conservation method (ECM) PermaFrost NMR® nano-technology from Powertron Global®.  It very quickly and 
effectively restored the chillers’ performance by utilising significantly less electrical power to operate than 
before the ECM implementation. The International Site A Chillers #1 and #2 PermaFrost NMR® Project once again 
demonstrated that the ECM PermaFrost NMR® improves performance and is safe and harmless to any 
Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (HVACR) system.
PermaFrost NMR® has been installed in more than 120,000 HVACR systems around the world since it was 
first introduced in 2002 without a single failure or liability claim against the technology.
