~ Evaporator Flow Rate was previously set at 143.36% during the pre and post testing
• Chiller nominal operation design should be 758.00 kWR cooling capacity
• Chiller cooling capacity was 523.33 kWR prior to ECM and 666.05 kWR 
   thereafter
• Chiller cooling capacity was restored by 142.72 kWR or 27.27% following 
   the ECM
• Chiller design eﬃciency increase from 69.04% to 90.19% ~ 30.63% 
   improvement
• Chiller nominal operation design should be 883.00 kWR cooling capacity
• Chiller cooling capacity was 827.96 kWR prior to ECM and 910.76 kWR 
   thereafter
• Chiller cooling capacity was restored by 82.8 kWR or 10.00% following 
   the ECM
• Chiller design eﬃciency increase from 93.77% to 120.37% ~ 28.37% 
   improvement
