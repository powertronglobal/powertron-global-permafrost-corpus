The final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® Baseline and Post 
measurement period of the chillers are:
Baseline Energy Consumption
Adjusted Baseline: 666.05 kWR
Adjusted kW Baseline: 0.3221 kW/ton * 666.05 kWR = 214.53 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 214.53 kWE * 3,040 Annual Operating Hrs = 652,171 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 652,171  * ZAR 1.10 = ZAR 717,388
Post Energy Consumption
kWE AERP: 0.2466 kWE * 666.05 kWR = 164.25 kWE
Annual kWh ERP: 164.25 kWE * 3,040 hours = 499,320 kWh
Annual Cost ERP: 499,320 kWh * ZAR 1.10 = ZAR 549,252
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy kWh (savings) Per Year: 652,171 – 499,320  = 152,851 kWh
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: ZAR 717,388 – ZAR 549,252 = ZAR 168,136
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: ZAR 168,136 / 12 = R14,011
Return On Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in pilot System: ZAR 238,000 
Estimated Chiller ROI Period: ZAR 238,000 / ZAR 14,011 = 16.99 months
