Measurement and Veriﬁcation (M&V)
of the Energy Savings Project
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected, compiled and verified in accordance 
with the International Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) framework using National Institutes 
of Standards & Technology (NIST) calibrated devices for the highest level of accuracy and data integrity.  
IPMVP, developed by hundreds of organizations and executives from over 25 countries, provides consensus 
best practices for measuring and verifying renewable energy performance. It is the industry standard for 
Eskom. Because of its wide international adoption, it has been identified as the best Measurement and 
Verification (M&V) Framework to determine emission reductions and secure financial compensation resulting 
from Energy Conservation Methods (ECM).
