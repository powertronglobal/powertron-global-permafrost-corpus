The high kilowatt Energy to kilowatt Refrigeration (kWE/kWR) ratio measured in situ was in \nline with ASHRAE defined performance loss and operating cost parameters. \nThe thermal degradation problem affecting the chillers was corrected by a single treatment of the energy \nconservation method (ECM) PermaFrost NMR® nano-technology from Powertron Global®.  It very quickly and \neffectively restored the chillers’ performance by utilising significantly less electrical power to operate than \nbefore the ECM implementation. The International Site A Chillers #1 and #2 PermaFrost NMR® Project once again \ndemonstrated that the ECM PermaFrost NMR® improves performance and is safe and harmless to any \nHeating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (HVACR) system.\nPermaFrost NMR® has been installed in more than 120,000 HVACR systems around the world since it was \nfirst introduced in 2002 without a single failure or liability claim against the technology.\nThe performance improvements and energy savings were:\n1\nHealthcare System ALLER #1\nHealthcare System ALLER #2\n-02.57%\n27.27%\n-23.44%\n30.97%\n30.63%\n3,040\nZAR 1.10\n168.57\n214.53\n652,171\nZAR 717,388\n164.25\n499,320\nZAR 549,252\nZAR 168,136\nZAR 238,000\n1.42 Years\n-14.32%\n10.00%\n-22.11%\n28.55%\n28.37%\n3,040\nZAR 1.10\n144.88\n159.38\n484,515\nZAR 532,967\n124.14\n377,386\nZAR 415,124\nZAR 117,843\nZAR 238,000\n2.02 Years\nKilowatts (kWE)\nActual Cooling Capacity\nEnergy Input (kWE/kWR)\nCoeﬃcient of Performance (COP)\nDesign Eﬃciency Increase\nAnnual Operating Hours\nTotal Power Cost per kWE\nkWE Measured (BASE)\nkWE Adjusted (BASE)\nAnnual kWh (BASE)\nAnnual Cost (BASE)\nkWE Measured (AERP)\nAnnual kWh (AERP)\nAnnual Cost (AERP)\nAnnual Energy Savings\nTechnology Treatment Cost\nReturn on Investment (ROI)\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website.", "tokens": 830, "chars": 3073, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_066_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:0421e2827e8b47e67b674e7f7c9826b0ef3a7e7250661ccefa54c56554b7fe39"}

The goal of the technology is to improve the thermal transfer therefore as \nlong as the flow rates are the same during the pre and post periods, the improvement percentage will remain the same. \nThe focus of the pilot is on the improvement delta.  This percentage improvement can be used to project savings if the flow \nrates are held constant. Upon correction of flow in the evaporator to levels suggested by the manufacturer additional \nincreases in thermal energy transfer will be apparent. This will deliver to the client, increased energy efficiencies and \nsystem capacity. While there could be some energy efficiencies regarding pump energy it will be negligible and pump \nenergy was not considered due to the boundary of the measurement of the chiller.  \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 747, "chars": 3411, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_066_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_066_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:da607b55f6a152eec5b0946cd6adcce37d2a8a7b8ca991144009acf08abde694"}
