First, to verify the current capacity and efficiency of a 16-year-old water cooled chiller in relation to \noriginal equipment manufacturer (OEM) design specifications.  Second, to demonstrate what, if any, material \nperformance changes occur in this same chiller after being treated with PermaFrost NMR ECM.  And third, to \ndetermine what, if any, financial benefits are associated with any efficiency improvements realized.  \nThe identification of pilot chiller involved in the study is recorded as follows:\n \n• Nominal 300-Ton York Chiller, Mfg. Date: 1999, R-123, 208 volt-3 Phase, Model YTH1B1CE-CHK\nECM Product Brief\nPermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented surface science nanotechnology that uses Nucleo Molecular \nRegenerative (NMR®) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, one-time treatment with no down time \nrequired, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type of climate control system in which it is \ninstalled.  The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling efficiency and increased capacity, \nboth of which result in lower overall costs to operate a system and extended equipment life. \nMethodology\nAfter verifying the proper rates of water flowing through the chiller evaporator and condenser barrels before \nbeginning the pilot, the subsequent measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and \ncompiled in accordance with Option B of the IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) \nframework. \nThe results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic \nengineering formulas::\n \n• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) \n \n• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage \n \n• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)\n \n• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = (Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T) / 12,000 BTU\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 788, "chars": 3313, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_081_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:9c98faeac9cb82828d7c08b98d8dc4b47a4a9ccf636a15689f9981ddd5b04b43"}

The degraded equipment performance is costing Major Botanical Garden and the City of New \nYork significant operational dollars through wasted energy. Despite its very low annual runtime hours \ncompared to other chillers in the geographical region who run as much as three times the amount of hours, \nthe pilot chiller was found to be using significantly more \nenergy to operate than when it was new.\nThe adjacent chart illustrates the performance \nrestoration the ECM created in the treated chiller. The \noperational efficiency rating of this chiller before it was \ntreated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in \nkW/ton,  was 0.66.\nThe operational efficiency rating of this chiller to after                \nbeing treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in \nkW/ton,  is currently 0.54. The higher baseline kW/ton\nrating measured in-situ was expected when compared to \nthe ASHRAE predicted loss of operational performance \nefficiency estimate for similar aged chillers. \nSummary of Key Performance Measurements\nThe table below summarizes the substantial improvements resulting from the implementation of the \nPermaFrost NMR® ECM into the pilot chiller. \nReduction in\nPer Unit Costs\nEquating to a\n18.2% reduction\nCost Per Cooling Unit to Operate\nkW/ton\n.12 kW/ton\nBaseline\nPost ECM\n0.66\n0.54\nTYPE OF MEASUREMENT\nBASELINE\n0.66\n273\n10.9° F\n5.6\n211,584\n$33,853 \nPOST\n0.54\n334\n14.4° F\n6.53\n173,184\n$27,709 \nRESULTS\n18.2% Reduction\n22.3% Increase\n32.1% Increase\n22.3% Increase\n38,400 Annual kWh Savings \n$6,144 Annual Energy Cost Savings\nkW/Ton\nCapacity in Tons\nChilled Water Delta-T\nCoeﬃcient of Performance\nAnnual KWh Usage \nEstimated Cost to Operate\nThe full complement of detailed and witnessed measurements are on file in the office of the Major Botanical Garden Chief Engineer\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 683, "chars": 2686, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_081_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_081_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:37f828d8e153d032223847dfe1fa34df9ebed5d1a6f8a62b516f417b0349920a"}

Working together, these improvements reduce the \nannual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller was \nwhen operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then \nsubtracting the revised cost to run the chiller at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® ECM was \ninstalled. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours or \nload % the chiller will now operate due to the restored performance profile. This restored performance profile allows the \nchiller to satisfy the internal building load with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.\n3\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\n®\n5.6\nPassenger vehicles\n1.4\nGarbage trucks of waste sent to\nthe landﬁll instead of recycled\n2,979\nGallons of gasoline\nconsumed\n28,441\nPounds of coal burned\nannually\n61.6\nBarrels of oil\nconsumed\n3.6\nHomes’ electricity use for\none year\n4\nMajor Botanical Garden is Saving More than Just Energy\nBy treating just this single chiller with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the manner in which the pilot chiller is \ncurrently being operated, Major Botanical Garden and the City of New York will save approximately 38,400 kWh per year and \nall the costs associated with those savings.
