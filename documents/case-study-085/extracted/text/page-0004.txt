Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the Major Botanical Garden chiller.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 273 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: .66 kW/ton * 334 tons = 220.4 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 220.4 kW * 960 Annual Operating Hrs = 211,584 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 211,584 kWh * $.16 = $33,853
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: 0.54 kW/ton * 334 tons = 180.4 kW
Annual kWh Post: 180.4 kW * 960 hours = 173,184 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 173,184 kWh * $.16 cents = $27,709
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $33,853 - $27,709 = $6,144
Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $6,144 / 12 = $512
Initial Payback Period
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot chiller: $24,000
Estimated ROI Period for Major Botanical Garden on the chiller: $24,000 / $512 = 3.9 Years
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 25.6%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 128%
Utilizing data collected during the pilot study, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for 
Major Botanical Garden for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in both capacity and efficiency. Working together, these improvements reduce the 
annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller was 
when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then 
subtracting the revised cost to run the chiller at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® ECM was 
installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours or 
load % the chiller will now operate due to the restored performance profile. This restored performance profile allows the 
chiller to satisfy the internal building load with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
