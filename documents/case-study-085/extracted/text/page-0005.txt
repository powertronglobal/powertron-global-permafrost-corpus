Major Botanical Garden is Saving More than Just Energy
By treating just this single chiller with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the manner in which the pilot chiller is

benefit the surrounding communities in which they operate.  Imagine the positive environmental impacts of 
treating the rest of the Major Botanical Garden and all the government buildings in the entire City of New York.

being released or any of the following:
