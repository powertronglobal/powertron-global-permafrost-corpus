Recovered Wasted Energy with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Like everyone in the world, Major Botanical Garden and the City of New York have the problem of thermal degradation in 
their Chillers and HVAC units. The degraded equipment performance is costing Major Botanical Garden and the City of New 
York significant operational dollars through wasted energy. Despite its very low annual runtime hours 
compared to other chillers in the geographical region who run as much as three times the amount of hours, 
the pilot chiller was found to be using significantly more 
energy to operate than when it was new.
The adjacent chart illustrates the performance 
restoration the ECM created in the treated chiller. The 
operational efficiency rating of this chiller before it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton,  was 0.66.
The operational efficiency rating of this chiller to after                
being treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton,  is currently 0.54. The higher baseline kW/ton
rating measured in-situ was expected when compared to 
the ASHRAE predicted loss of operational performance 
efficiency estimate for similar aged chillers.
