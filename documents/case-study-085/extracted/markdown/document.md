HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report

Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study

The purpose of this jointly-conducted ECM study between the Major Botanical Garden and PTG engineering teams was

threefold.  First, to verify the current capacity and efficiency of a 16-year-old water cooled chiller in relation to

original equipment manufacturer (OEM) design specifications.  Second, to demonstrate what, if any, material

performance changes occur in this same chiller after being treated with PermaFrost NMR ECM.  And third, to

determine what, if any, financial benefits are associated with any efficiency improvements realized.

The identification of pilot chiller involved in the study is recorded as follows:

• Nominal 300-Ton York Chiller, Mfg. Date: 1999, R-123, 208 volt-3 Phase, Model YTH1B1CE-CHK

ECM Product Brief

PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented surface science nanotechnology that uses Nucleo Molecular

Regenerative (NMR®) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, one-time treatment with no down time

required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type of climate control system in which it is

installed.  The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling efficiency and increased capacity,

both of which result in lower overall costs to operate a system and extended equipment life.

Methodology

After verifying the proper rates of water flowing through the chiller evaporator and condenser barrels before

beginning the pilot, the subsequent measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and

compiled in accordance with Option B of the IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol)

framework.

The results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic

engineering formulas::

• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase)

• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage

• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)

• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = (Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T) / 12,000 BTU

Recovered Wasted Energy with PermaFrost NMR® ECM

Like everyone in the world, Major Botanical Garden and the City of New York have the problem of thermal degradation in

their Chillers and HVAC units. The degraded equipment performance is costing Major Botanical Garden and the City of New

York significant operational dollars through wasted energy. Despite its very low annual runtime hours

compared to other chillers in the geographical region who run as much as three times the amount of hours,

the pilot chiller was found to be using significantly more

energy to operate than when it was new.

The adjacent chart illustrates the performance

restoration the ECM created in the treated chiller. The

operational efficiency rating of this chiller before it was

treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in

kW/ton,  was 0.66.

The operational efficiency rating of this chiller to after

being treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in

kW/ton,  is currently 0.54. The higher baseline kW/ton

rating measured in-situ was expected when compared to

the ASHRAE predicted loss of operational performance

efficiency estimate for similar aged chillers.

Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics

The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR®

Post measurement period for the Major Botanical Garden chiller.

Baseline Energy Consumption

Baseline Tonnage: 273 tons

Adjusted kW Baseline: .66 kW/ton * 334 tons = 220.4 kW

Adjusted Baseline kWh: 220.4 kW * 960 Annual Operating Hrs = 211,584 kWh

Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 211,584 kWh * $.16 = $33,853

Post Energy Consumption

kW Post: 0.54 kW/ton * 334 tons = 180.4 kW

Annual kWh Post: 180.4 kW * 960 hours = 173,184 kWh

Annual Cost Post: 173,184 kWh * $.16 cents = $27,709

Savings Per Year

Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $33,853 - $27,709 = $6,144

Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $6,144 / 12 = $512

Initial Payback Period

Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot chiller: $24,000

Estimated ROI Period for Major Botanical Garden on the chiller: $24,000 / $512 = 3.9 Years

Annual Internal Rate of Return = 25.6%

Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 128%

Utilizing data collected during the pilot study, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for

Major Botanical Garden for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy

savings resulting from the improvement in both capacity and efficiency. Working together, these improvements reduce the

annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller was

when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then

subtracting the revised cost to run the chiller at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® ECM was

installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours or

load % the chiller will now operate due to the restored performance profile. This restored performance profile allows the

chiller to satisfy the internal building load with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.

Major Botanical Garden is Saving More than Just Energy

By treating just this single chiller with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the manner in which the pilot chiller is

currently being operated, Major Botanical Garden and the City of New York will save approximately 38,400 kWh per year and

all the costs associated with those savings. From an environmental impact standpoint, Major Botanical Garden will also

benefit the surrounding communities in which they operate.  Imagine the positive environmental impacts of

treating the rest of the Major Botanical Garden and all the government buildings in the entire City of New York.

The 38,400 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 26.5 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from

being released or any of the following:

Annual greenhouse emissions from:
