The following are the final calculated performance measurements (detailed below the chart) after performing 
the regression analysis to account to the restored capacity brought about by  PermaFrost NMR®.
Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to determine a very accurate ROI for 
Healthcare System A for implementing this ECM:
Baseline kWh = (9,340 CTW / 1,000) * 6,570 Annual Operating Hrs = 61,364 kWh
Baseline Cost To Run = 61,364 kWh * $.11 = $6,750
Regression Analysis is then used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Pilot Unit    
Adjusted Base Tonnage = 8.52 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted Total Watts = 1,419 WPT * 8.52 tons = 12,090 TW
Adjusted Base kWh = (12,090 TW/1,000) * 6,570 Annual Operating Hrs = 79,431 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM = 79,431 kWh * $.11 = $8,737
Post ECM kWh = (8,268 NTW / 1,000) * 6,570 Annual Operating Hrs = 54,321 kWh
Cost to Run After ECM = 54,321 kWh * $.11 = $5,975
Cost Savings per Month = ($8,737 - $5,975) / 12 = $230.16
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed @ $1,000 / $230.16 = 4.3
 
ROI = 4.3 months
