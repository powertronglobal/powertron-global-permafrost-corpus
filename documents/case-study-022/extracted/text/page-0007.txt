Energy Reporting Period (Post)
The identical IPMVP data recordings from the baseline (including insertion depths with probes) were
recorded on 9/4/2012 using the same recently NIST calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy.
Given the 26% warmer outdoor temperature in the Post, the compressor Amps (60% of the total Amps) were
adjusted downward by 26%. This adjustment then permeates through to the Post Watts as well as the Watts 
per Ton. The measurements are as follows:
