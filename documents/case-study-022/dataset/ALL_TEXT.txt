PermaFrost NMR® Data Center Report
Healthcare System A
November 6, 2012
Executive Summary
         This report contains specific information regarding the detailed forensic performance testing (outlined later 
in this report) of the energy control measure (ECM) PermaFrost NMR® in the headquarters of Healthcare System A (Healthcare System A). [Data Center Operations Manager], Healthcare System A Data Center Operations Manager, and [Data Center Consultant] of Enabled Energy, 
Healthcare System A’s trusted data center consulting firm, personally witnessed all phases of the testing and data collection. 
The 7.7-ton HVAC Equipment Manufacturer split system supporting the power generator room uses R-22 refrigerant and was installed in 
December of 2003. On average the unit runs 6,570 hours each year. Immediately following the baseline testing, 
the unit was treated with 8 ounces of the PermaFrost NMR® product specially formulated for R-22 systems.  
Since there were no other ECM’s going on during this pilot project, the improvement in efficiency and restored 
capacity gained directly at the unit is solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The improvement in 
efficiency now enables the pilot unit to maintain the current set point utilizing a warmer refrigerant temperature 
while also providing drier supply air. In short, the unit is producing more Btu’s while using less energy, 
meaning the compressor doesn’t work as hard to do the same job as before. This greater operational efficiency is 
due to the restoration of the heat transfer ability of the evaporator and condenser coils, the removal of thermal inefficiency 
and improved refrigerant flow due to reduced laminar friction. 
Since the outside air temperatures in the baseline was cooler than that of the post reporting period, a slight 
downward adjustment in compressor Amperage was made to the resulting numbers.  The return air 
temperatures directly at the pilot unit were very similar. 
Following treatment with PermaFrost NMR® the pilot unit showed an average 31.7% reduction in both Total 
Watts and Watts/Ton and a 11.8% reduction in Amps, while at the same time producing an increase in capacity 
of 23,213 Btuh (nearly 2 full tons).  The unit also showed a substantial improvement in EER of 46.3%.  
Additionally, the pilot unit showed an average of 29.4% improvement in system efficiency, which is another 
very measurable way to view the thermodynamic enhancement of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result of 
the average ECM improvements is an ROI to Healthcare System A of just 4.3 months.  The tables of data and financial 
calculations are available for review at the end of this report.

Product Brief
         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure 
(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) technology as its core agent.  A sustainable, 
one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any 
type of system in which it is installed – DX (direct expansion air and chilled water systems), Chillers 
(screw, reciprocating, scroll and centrifugal), heat pumps, ice making equipment.  Specialized 
applications include computer room cooling and dehumidification systems, chiller plants (water and ice 
production applications), domestic and industrial refrigeration (ammonia low and ultra low 
temperature), air-cooled single application water chillers and split and package rooftop HVAC 
equipment.
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and 
improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allows a system to achieve set point temperatures in a more 
rapid fashion which reduces system loading and operating periods.  The indirect benefits resulting from 
the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW 
hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, less metallic wear, longer overall equipment life and a 
reduced carbon footprint for Healthcare System A.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocols (IPMVP) are used to develop this 
report.  The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and 
Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the 
IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and 
products.
There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize.  They 
are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option A) was the option used for this report. Option A is 
defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single 
source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM 
affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option A short-term 
measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained.  The savings are calculated by 
short-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using 
measurements of proxies of energy use. 
The final computation follows the formula:
Energy Science Division
Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy
+ - Routine adjustments + - Non-Routine Adjustments

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces. 
A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the unit’s operational 
conditions were satisfactory.  Baseline measurements were recorded and then the proper amount and type 
of PermaFrost NMR® was injected. The product was then allowed four (4) weeks to seat itself into the metal 
surfaces before post measurements were taken again to establish the efficiency gains.
 
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP International Performance Measurement and 
Verification Protocol as the M&V plan.  The measurements and final calculations were performed and 
certified by Powertron Global’s Senior Energy Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer], ME/CEM/CMC/CMVP.
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
kW = Volts * Amps * 1.47 (Power Factor .85 *1.732) - for 3-Phase
 
Delta T = Return Air DB – Supply Air DB
 
Enthalpy = Return Air WB Deg. F and Supply Air WB Deg. F converted to Enthalpy
 
Actual Btuh Capacity = Measured CFM * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta (Baseline – Post)
 
System Eﬃciency % = Actual Coil Capacity Btuh / Nominal Coil Capacity Btuh
 
EER = Btuh / Adjusted Watts

Energy Reporting Period (Post)
The identical IPMVP data recordings from the baseline (including insertion depths with probes) were
recorded on 9/4/2012 using the same recently NIST calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy.
Given the 26% warmer outdoor temperature in the Post, the compressor Amps (60% of the total Amps) were
adjusted downward by 26%. This adjustment then permeates through to the Post Watts as well as the Watts 
per Ton. The measurements are as follows:

Results
The following are the final calculated performance measurements (detailed below the chart) after performing 
the regression analysis to account to the restored capacity brought about by  PermaFrost NMR®.
Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to determine a very accurate ROI for 
Healthcare System A for implementing this ECM:
Baseline kWh = (9,340 CTW / 1,000) * 6,570 Annual Operating Hrs = 61,364 kWh
Baseline Cost To Run = 61,364 kWh * $.11 = $6,750
Regression Analysis is then used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Pilot Unit    
Adjusted Base Tonnage = 8.52 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted Total Watts = 1,419 WPT * 8.52 tons = 12,090 TW
Adjusted Base kWh = (12,090 TW/1,000) * 6,570 Annual Operating Hrs = 79,431 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM = 79,431 kWh * $.11 = $8,737
Post ECM kWh = (8,268 NTW / 1,000) * 6,570 Annual Operating Hrs = 54,321 kWh
Cost to Run After ECM = 54,321 kWh * $.11 = $5,975
Cost Savings per Month = ($8,737 - $5,975) / 12 = $230.16
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed @ $1,000 / $230.16 = 4.3
 
ROI = 4.3 months
