[Data Center Operations Manager], Healthcare System A Data Center Operations Manager, and [Data Center Consultant] of Enabled Energy, \nHealthcare System A’s trusted data center consulting firm, personally witnessed all phases of the testing and data collection. \nThe 7.7-ton HVAC Equipment Manufacturer split system supporting the power generator room uses R-22 refrigerant and was installed in \nDecember of 2003. On average the unit runs 6,570 hours each year. Immediately following the baseline testing, \nthe unit was treated with 8 ounces of the PermaFrost NMR® product specially formulated for R-22 systems.  \nSince there were no other ECM’s going on during this pilot project, the improvement in efficiency and restored \ncapacity gained directly at the unit is solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The improvement in \nefficiency now enables the pilot unit to maintain the current set point utilizing a warmer refrigerant temperature \nwhile also providing drier supply air. In short, the unit is producing more Btu’s while using less energy, \nmeaning the compressor doesn’t work as hard to do the same job as before. This greater operational efficiency is \ndue to the restoration of the heat transfer ability of the evaporator and condenser coils, the removal of thermal inefficiency \nand improved refrigerant flow due to reduced laminar friction. \nSince the outside air temperatures in the baseline was cooler than that of the post reporting period, a slight \ndownward adjustment in compressor Amperage was made to the resulting numbers.  The return air \ntemperatures directly at the pilot unit were very similar. \nFollowing treatment with PermaFrost NMR® the pilot unit showed an average 31.7% reduction in both Total \nWatts and Watts/Ton and a 11.8% reduction in Amps, while at the same time producing an increase in capacity \nof 23,213 Btuh (nearly 2 full tons).  The unit also showed a substantial improvement in EER of 46.3%.  \nAdditionally, the pilot unit showed an average of 29.4% improvement in system efficiency, which is another \nvery measurable way to view the thermodynamic enhancement of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result of \nthe average ECM improvements is an ROI to Healthcare System A of just 4.3 months.  The tables of data and financial \ncalculations are available for review at the end of this report.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 764, "chars": 3450, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_026_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:111594ee6cd749c8e7575793b13259d809a05ca1d9bb72730ee44e32b7c6fa76"}

A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any \ntype of system in which it is installed – DX (direct expansion air and chilled water systems), Chillers \n(screw, reciprocating, scroll and centrifugal), heat pumps, ice making equipment.  Specialized \napplications include computer room cooling and dehumidification systems, chiller plants (water and ice \nproduction applications), domestic and industrial refrigeration (ammonia low and ultra low \ntemperature), air-cooled single application water chillers and split and package rooftop HVAC \nequipment.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and \nimproved refrigerant velocity – all of which allows a system to achieve set point temperatures in a more \nrapid fashion which reduces system loading and operating periods.  The indirect benefits resulting from \nthe enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW \nhours used, less amp draw at the compressor, less metallic wear, longer overall equipment life and a \nreduced carbon footprint for Healthcare System A.\nEnergy Science Division\nOIL BUILD-UP\nOIL REMOVED\nBEFORE TREATMENT\nAFTER TREATMENT\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 445, "chars": 2121, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_026_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_026_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:f37df4a3c53ae050a1b3d0fb1f0f81dab688f9be5c73cc67cafab206b222e90c"}

The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and \nAir-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the \nIPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and \nproducts.\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize.  They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option A) was the option used for this report. Option A is \ndefined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single \nsource of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM \naffected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option A short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained.  The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using \nmeasurements of proxies of energy use. \nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+ - Routine adjustments + - Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 433, "chars": 2131, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_026_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_026_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:bf8646056f179dceaa326d200f728775ad928cf520ed08ff0964fea2da55cc63"}
