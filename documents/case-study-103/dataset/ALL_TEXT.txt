PermaFrost NMR® Eﬃciency Report
Major US Telecom Call Center     
September, 2013 
Executive Summary
         This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure 
(ECM) PermaFrost NMR® into three (3) package roof top units (RTU’s) supporting the various parts of the 
Major US Telecom Support Call Center in Chattanooga, TN.  Detailed forensic performance testing (outlined later in 
this report) was performed on the three RTU’s using R22 as the refrigerant.  Following testing, each RTU 
was treated with the proper amount and type of the PermaFrost NMR® technology specially formulated for 
these types of systems.
Measurement and Verification (M&V) was conducted pre-installation and post-gestation. The purpose of 
the testing was to 1) show how the ECM improves the thermal performance of any system it is installed in, 
and 2) show that the ECM is safe and will not harm Major US Telecom’s  HVAC equipment.
The improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at each RTU was solely attributable to 
the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. This is a result of the reversal of thermal inefficiency on heat exchange surfaces.  
Following treatment with the ECM, the three RTU’s showed an effective net average 21.4% reduction in 
kW/ton based on the exact capacity measured in the baseline M&V and the post gestation M&V when 
operating at 100% load. The ECM also produced an average increase cooling capacity of 23.4% which 
equates to 5.68 tons or an average of 1.89 tons per RTU. Prior to the ECM, the three RTU’s produced a total 
of 24.28 tons of cooling as measured in-situ. After the ECM, the average combined tonnage produced 
increased to 29.96 tons. This 23.4% cooling capacity increase from the baseline performance levels led to an 
effective average increase in COP across the RTU’s of 26.4% and a calculated reduction in kWh of 25.8% All 
of these factors directly correlate to what Major US Telecom will realize in energy savings as they operate these 
RTU’s in the future as well as other similar HVAC equipment across their portfolio.
Following treatment the three RTU’s also showed a combined 23.5% increase in the Enthalpy Delta across 
the coil versus the Baseline, which is a critical measurement used to determine the thermodynamic

enhancement brought about by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result of the ECM improvements is an 
ROI to Major US Telecom that is measured in a months. The tables of data used to determine the financial payback 
are available for review at the end of this report. 
This 10-ton Carrier package RTU was one of three 
similar type and age units involved in the pilot. These 
units help cool the Major US Telecom Call Center in Chattanooga, 
TN.  The image shows several of the NIST-calibrated 
and certified digital instrumentation used to calculate 
the efficiency of each of the three RTU’s in both the 
Baseline and Post.

Product Brief
         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure 
(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative® (NMR™) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, 
one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for at least 10 years in any type of 
system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and equipment that 
PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); chilled water systems 
(both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia refrigeration plants (single 
compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The equipment utilized in these 
systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single and multi-stage), scroll, 
reciprocating and screw configurations.
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® in any type of HVACR system are improved cooling performance, 
increased capacity and improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point 
temperatures in a more rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits 
resulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, 
less kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced 
carbon footprint for Major US Telecom.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) was utilized in the 
development of this report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating, 
Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization 
(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation 
methods and products.
There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They 
are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is 
defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM as the single source of 
measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM affected 
equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term 
measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by 
short-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations 
using measurements of proxies of energy use. 
The final computation follows the formula:

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces. 
A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the operational 
conditions of the systems were satisfactory. Baseline M&V was recorded on each of the three RTU’s and six 
compressors and then the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected directly into the 
suction side of the refrigerant loop. The gestation period for the Major US Telecom pilot was 9 weeks. Prior to taking 
Post measurements, systems need to achieve at least 300 or more hours of runtime to ensure adequate 
performance improvement time. At the end of this gestation period, Post M&V results were taken in the 
identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same or very similar outside air 
temperatures as well as the wet bulb and dry bulb temperatures of the air entering the respective coils. 
These are three of the most critical variables to contend with in an in-situ HVAC testing situation. When 
analyzing all of the data in the baseline and post, no adjustments to the data were needed.
  
The following report produces the utilization 
of the International Performance 
Measurement and Verification Protocol 
(IPMVP) as the M&V plan. Don Wong, 
Director of Facilities for Major US Telecom; Ron 
Roberts, Property Management Firm C Account Manager for Major US Telecom; 
and Kristen Scutella, Business Development 
Executive at Comfort Systems USA all 
combined to pull together to carry out this 
successful pilot. The final calculations were 
performed by Powertron Global®’s Forensic 
Mechanical Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer].  
As shown above, Bryan Johnston (left), HVAC technician for WJ 
O’Neil (subcontractor to Comfort Systems) physically witnessed the 
measurements being taken.

Results
The following are the final calculated average performance measurement improvements following the 
PermaFrost NMR® Post measurement periods on the three Major US Telecom RTU’s.  
PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for Major US Telecom
Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Major US Telecom for 
implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This greater capacity reduces the runtime hours and in turn 
reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post. The true ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the system 
was when operating at its original energy profile then subtracting the cost to operate the system at its newly restored 
energy profile less the percentage of increased capacity. This regression calculation is the most scientific method of 
accounting for the reduced number of hours the units will now run due to their increased capacity which allows the 
units to reach set temperatures quicker and shut off sooner.

Baseline kWh        36.96 kW * 4,035 Annual Operating Hrs = 149,134 kWh
Cost to Run Baseline        149,134 kWh * $.09 = $13,422.06
Post ECM kWh        36.02 kW * 4,035 Annual Operating Hrs = 145,340.7 kWh
Revised kWh (based on avg. 23.4% restored capacity)        145,341 kWh * (1 - .234) = 111,331 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Post        111,331 kWh * $.09 = $10,019.79
Avoided Energy Costs (Savings) Per Month        ($13,422.06 - $10,019.79) / 12 = $283.52
Cost of ECM        $3,750
ROI        $3,750 / $283.52 = 13.2 
 
 ROI = 13-14 months
*Note – A cost of $.09 per kWh was used for this Chattanooga Pilot calculation. When using the national average kWh 
cost of $.105 the ROI will be 11.4 months.
