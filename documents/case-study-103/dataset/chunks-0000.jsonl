Detailed forensic performance testing (outlined later in \nthis report) was performed on the three RTU’s using R22 as the refrigerant.  Following testing, each RTU \nwas treated with the proper amount and type of the PermaFrost NMR® technology specially formulated for \nthese types of systems.\nMeasurement and Verification (M&V) was conducted pre-installation and post-gestation. The purpose of \nthe testing was to 1) show how the ECM improves the thermal performance of any system it is installed in, \nand 2) show that the ECM is safe and will not harm Major US Telecom’s  HVAC equipment.\nThe improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at each RTU was solely attributable to \nthe PermaFrost NMR® ECM. This is a result of the reversal of thermal inefficiency on heat exchange surfaces.  \nFollowing treatment with the ECM, the three RTU’s showed an effective net average 21.4% reduction in \nkW/ton based on the exact capacity measured in the baseline M&V and the post gestation M&V when \noperating at 100% load. The ECM also produced an average increase cooling capacity of 23.4% which \nequates to 5.68 tons or an average of 1.89 tons per RTU. Prior to the ECM, the three RTU’s produced a total \nof 24.28 tons of cooling as measured in-situ. After the ECM, the average combined tonnage produced \nincreased to 29.96 tons. This 23.4% cooling capacity increase from the baseline performance levels led to an \neffective average increase in COP across the RTU’s of 26.4% and a calculated reduction in kWh of 25.8% All \nof these factors directly correlate to what Major US Telecom will realize in energy savings as they operate these \nRTU’s in the future as well as other similar HVAC equipment across their portfolio.\nFollowing treatment the three RTU’s also showed a combined 23.5% increase in the Enthalpy Delta across \nthe coil versus the Baseline, which is a critical measurement used to determine the thermodynamic   \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 716, "chars": 3154, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_102_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:b36a9afac04be4a2a2bfd9f38cfbbfd529acbc891d32991cdc64651659004050"}

A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for at least 10 years in any type of \nsystem in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and equipment that \nPermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); chilled water systems \n(both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia refrigeration plants (single \ncompressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The equipment utilized in these \nsystems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single and multi-stage), scroll, \nreciprocating and screw configurations.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® in any type of HVACR system are improved cooling performance, \nincreased capacity and improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point \ntemperatures in a more rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits \nresulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, \nless kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced \ncarbon footprint for Major US Telecom.\nEnergy Science Division\nBOUNDARY LAYER\nOIL REMOVED\nBEFORE TREATMENT\nAFTER TREATMENT\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 671, "chars": 3148, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_102_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_102_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:0397c939ded7f2163cde8e31a47518b38588a6e6be135d8e1edd915b48ad10b6"}

Baseline M&V was recorded on each of the three RTU’s and six \ncompressors and then the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected directly into the \nsuction side of the refrigerant loop. The gestation period for the Major US Telecom pilot was 9 weeks. Prior to taking \nPost measurements, systems need to achieve at least 300 or more hours of runtime to ensure adequate \nperformance improvement time. At the end of this gestation period, Post M&V results were taken in the \nidentical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same or very similar outside air \ntemperatures as well as the wet bulb and dry bulb temperatures of the air entering the respective coils. \nThese are three of the most critical variables to contend with in an in-situ HVAC testing situation. When \nanalyzing all of the data in the baseline and post, no adjustments to the data were needed.\n  \nThe following report produces the utilization \nof the International Performance \nMeasurement and Verification Protocol \n(IPMVP) as the M&V plan. Don Wong, \nDirector of Facilities for Major US Telecom; Ron \nRoberts, Property Management Firm C Account Manager for Major US Telecom; \nand Kristen Scutella, Business Development \nExecutive at Comfort Systems USA all \ncombined to pull together to carry out this \nsuccessful pilot.

This regression calculation is the most scientific method of \naccounting for the reduced number of hours the units will now run due to their increased capacity which allows the \nunits to reach set temperatures quicker and shut off sooner.   \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\nEnergy Science Division\nBaseline kWh        36.96 kW * 4,035 Annual Operating Hrs = 149,134 kWh\nCost to Run Baseline        149,134 kWh * $.09 = $13,422.06\nPost ECM kWh        36.02 kW * 4,035 Annual Operating Hrs = 145,340.7 kWh\nRevised kWh (based on avg. 23.4% restored capacity)        145,341 kWh * (1 - .234) = 111,331 kWh\nRevised Cost to Run Post        111,331 kWh * $.09 = $10,019.79\nAvoided Energy Costs (Savings) Per Month        ($13,422.06 - $10,019.79) / 12 = $283.52\nCost of ECM        $3,750\nROI        $3,750 / $283.52 = 13.2 \n \n ROI = 13-14 months\n*Note – A cost of $.09 per kWh was used for this Chattanooga Pilot calculation.
