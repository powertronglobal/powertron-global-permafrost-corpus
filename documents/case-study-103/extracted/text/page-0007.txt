Energy Science Division
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
BTUH = CFM * 4.5 * Wet Bulb Enthalpy Delta
 
kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage
 
Percentage Eﬃciency = Measured BTUH / Manufacturers Design BTUH
 
Coeﬃcient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
       Detailed Results for Three 10-Ton Package RTU’s
System Description / Design Characteristics
These three RTU’s provide cooling for the Major US Telecom Customer Call Center located on Customer Delight 
Drive in Chattanooga, TN. Given the internal load of the facility and national weather BIN data, it is 
estimated that the RTU’s run ~4,035 hours per year prior to the ECM being implemented.
