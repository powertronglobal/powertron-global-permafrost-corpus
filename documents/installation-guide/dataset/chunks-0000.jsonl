The product must be installed \nby a HVAC trained technician pursuant to requirements set by the insurance \ncarrier. Other than that, customers have a variety of options when it comes to \ninstallation. \nPowertron can install but generally subcontracts to national HVAC service \ncompanies. Powertron can also train your qualified personnel or \nsubcontractors in a few minutes or by video instruction. A third option \npreferred by some enterprise customers is to have Powertron’s MBE/WBE \npartner, Argent Associates buy and install the product. \nInstallation \n•\nPermaFrost NMR® is installed while the unit is running – there is no\ndisruption to operations\n•\nProduct is injected into the refrigerant port\n•\nInstallation quantity is by the ounce: 1 ounce per ton of capacity for DX\nunits and 10% of total oil capacity for chillers\n•\nProduct comes in several sizes, made to order (ordering details here)\n•\nProduct is safe to handle (SDS link)\n•\nSmaller units usually take only 5-10 minutes to install\n•\nPowertron installation video (link)\n•\nMinority Supplier installation: Argent Associates (link to MBE page)", "tokens": 292, "chars": 1250, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 1}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "", "content_hash": "sha256:abc488151348df92748695deed6aba1a735e1cc50f3d2520809494772e0dd378"}
