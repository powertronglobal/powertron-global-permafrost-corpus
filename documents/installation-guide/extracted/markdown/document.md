Installation 
Summary 
PermaFrost NMR® installation is fairly simple. The product must be installed 
by a HVAC trained technician pursuant to requirements set by the insurance 
carrier. Other than that, customers have a variety of options when it comes to 
installation. 
Powertron can install but generally subcontracts to national HVAC service 
companies. Powertron can also train your qualified personnel or 
subcontractors in a few minutes or by video instruction. A third option 
preferred by some enterprise customers is to have Powertron’s MBE/WBE 
partner, Argent Associates buy and install the product.
