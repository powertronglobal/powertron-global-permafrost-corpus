A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any \ntype of system in which it is installed – DX (direct expansion air and chilled water systems), Chillers \n(screw, reciprocating, scroll and centrifugal), heat pumps, ice making equipment.  Specialized \napplications include computer room cooling and dehumidification systems, chiller plants (water and ice \nproduction applications), domestic and industrial refrigeration (ammonia low and ultra low \ntemperature), air-cooled single application water chillers and split and package rooftop HVAC \nequipment.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity, and \nimproved refrigerant velocity – all of which allows a system to achieve set point temperatures in a more \nrapid fashion that reduces system loading and operating periods.  The indirect benefits resulting from \nthe enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW \nhours used, less amp draw at the compressor, less metallic wear and longer overall equipment life.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\nUnit #1\n16-ton Liebert Computer Room Air Conditioning\n(CRAC) \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 556, "chars": 2633, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_105_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:8b1c98bf63b581114aab9e66964bc26549e946865676f47acca5fa04032d5114"}

Unit #1 now provides cooler supply air with greater efficiency due to the restoration of the heat \ntransfer capacity of the evaporator and condenser coils and increased the available useful tonnage. \nThe overall efficiency improved by 13.5% and the EER improved by 20.4%.  There was an increase in coil \ncapacity of 25,920 in Btuh which equates to gaining more than 2-tons of capacity or 15.7%.  There is also an \nimprovement of 2.1 degrees F in Delta T (difference between supply and return air) and an overall reduction \nin kWh and Watts per ton of 16.9%, which are other measurable way to view the thermodynamic \nenhancement of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. \nThe tables of data and financial calculations are available for review at the end of this report.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 458, "chars": 2095, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_105_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_105_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:8f6ca182d4d2d06e764df2992c52d72243a650bce2fb981ac20fdb0cfa279315"}
