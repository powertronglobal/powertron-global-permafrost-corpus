Product Brief
         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface science Energy Control Measure 
(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) technology as its core agent.  A sustainable, 
one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any 
type of system in which it is installed – DX (direct expansion air and chilled water systems), Chillers 
(screw, reciprocating, scroll and centrifugal), heat pumps, ice making equipment.  Specialized 
applications include computer room cooling and dehumidification systems, chiller plants (water and ice 
production applications), domestic and industrial refrigeration (ammonia low and ultra low 
temperature), air-cooled single application water chillers and split and package rooftop HVAC 
equipment.
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity, and 
improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allows a system to achieve set point temperatures in a more 
rapid fashion that reduces system loading and operating periods.  The indirect benefits resulting from 
the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW 
hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, less metallic wear and longer overall equipment life.

Executive Summary
This report contains specific information regarding the installation of PermaFrost NMR® in Unit #1 of two
16-ton Liebert Computer Room Air Conditioning (CRAC) supporting mission critical data center operations 
for this U.S. Communications Company (heretofore referred to as The Company) located in Long Island, 
New York.
Two Company representatives, one from Network Engineering and the other from Power and Energy 
Planning section of the Global Real Estate Department, managed this entire trial.  They were supported by 
The Company’s on-site contractor engineering support personnel.
The improved/restored efficiency on Unit #1directly attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was 
substantial.  Unit #1 now provides cooler supply air with greater efficiency due to the restoration of the heat 
transfer capacity of the evaporator and condenser coils and increased the available useful tonnage. 
The overall efficiency improved by 13.5% and the EER improved by 20.4%.  There was an increase in coil 
capacity of 25,920 in Btuh which equates to gaining more than 2-tons of capacity or 15.7%.  There is also an 
improvement of 2.1 degrees F in Delta T (difference between supply and return air) and an overall reduction 
in kWh and Watts per ton of 16.9%, which are other measurable way to view the thermodynamic 
enhancement of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. 
The tables of data and financial calculations are available for review at the end of this report.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocols (IPMVP) are used to develop this 
report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and 
Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the 
IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and 
products.
There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize.  They 
are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.  Option B is 
defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single 
source of measurement.  Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM 
affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term 
measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained.  The savings are calculated by 
short-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using 
measurements of proxies of energy use. 
The final computation follows the formula:
Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy
+ - Routine adjustments + - Non-Routine Adjustments

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces. 
The Company made the decision to treat two 16-ton CRAC units, both in good operating condition, 
supporting an isolated switching center within the facility.  A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment 
was implemented to determine if the two units’ operational conditions were satisfactory.  Baseline 
measurements were recorded and then the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected. The 
product was then allowed four (4) weeks to seat itself into the metal surfaces before post measurements 
were taken to establish the efficiency gains. 
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP International Performance Measurement and 
Verification Protocol as the M&V plan. The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global’s Senior 
Energy Engineer [Senior Energy Engineer] ME/CEM/CMC/CMVP.
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
kW = Volts X Amps x 1.56 (Three Phase) / 1000
 
Delta T = Return Air DB – Supply Air DB
 
Enthalpy = Return Air WB Deg. F and Supply Air WB Deg. F Converted to Enthalpy
 
Actual Btuh Capacity = Measured CFM X 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta 
 
System Eﬃciency % = Actual Coil Capacity Btuh / Nominal Coil Capacity Btuh
 
EER = Btuh / Watts

Results
The following results are based off of the Baseline Measurement of data and the Energy Reporting Period 
data from Unit #1.
Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to determine a very accurate ROI for 
The Company for implementing this ECM:
Baseline kWh = (15,705 W / 1,000) * 5,840 Annual Operating Hrs = 91,717 kWh
Baseline Cost To Run = 91,717 kWh * $.16 = $14,674
Regression Analysis is then used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Unit #1
Adjusted Base Tonnage = 15.88 tons (ERP) – 13.72 (base) = 2.16 tons + 13.72 tons = 15.88 tons
Adjusted Total Watts = 1,145 WPT * 15.88 tons = 18,183 W
Adjusted Base kWh = (18,183 W/1,000) * 5,840 Annual Operating Hrs = 106,189 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM = 106,189 kWh * $.16 = $16,990
Post ECM kWh = (15,104 W/ 1,000) * 5,840 Annual Operating Hrs = 88,207 kWh
Cost to Run After ECM = 88,207 kWh * $.16 = $14,113
Cost Savings per Month = ($16,990 - $14,113) / 12 = $239.75
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed @ $2,000 / $239.75 = 8.34
 
ROI = 8.3 months

Results
The following results are based off of the Baseline Measurement of data and the Energy Reporting Period 
data from Unit #2.
Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to determine a very accurate ROI for 
The Company for implementing this ECM:
Baseline kWh = (16,655 W / 1,000) * 5,840 Annual Operating Hrs = 97,265 kWh
Baseline Cost To Run = 97,265 kWh * $.16 = $15,562
Regression Analysis is then used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Unit #2
Adjusted Base Tonnage = 18.12 tons (ERP) – 13.72 (base) = 4.4 tons + 13.72 tons = 18.12 tons
Adjusted Total Watts = 1,214 WPT * 18.12 tons = 21,997 W
Adjusted Base kWh = (21,997 W/1,000) * 5,840 Annual Operating Hrs = 128,462 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM = 128,462 kWh * $.16 = $20,553
Post ECM kWh = (16,249 W/ 1,000) * 5,840 Annual Operating Hrs = 94,894 kWh
Cost to Run After ECM = 94,894 kWh * $.16 = $15,183
Cost Savings per Month = ($20,553 - $15,183) / 12 = $447.50
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed @ $2,000 / $447.50 = 4.47
