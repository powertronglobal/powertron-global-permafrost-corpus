Executive Summary
This report contains specific information regarding the installation of PermaFrost NMR® in Unit #1 of two
16-ton Liebert Computer Room Air Conditioning (CRAC) supporting mission critical data center operations 
for this U.S. Communications Company (heretofore referred to as The Company) located in Long Island, 
New York.
Two Company representatives, one from Network Engineering and the other from Power and Energy 
Planning section of the Global Real Estate Department, managed this entire trial.  They were supported by 
The Company’s on-site contractor engineering support personnel.
The improved/restored efficiency on Unit #1directly attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was 
substantial.  Unit #1 now provides cooler supply air with greater efficiency due to the restoration of the heat 
transfer capacity of the evaporator and condenser coils and increased the available useful tonnage. 
The overall efficiency improved by 13.5% and the EER improved by 20.4%.  There was an increase in coil 
capacity of 25,920 in Btuh which equates to gaining more than 2-tons of capacity or 15.7%.  There is also an 
improvement of 2.1 degrees F in Delta T (difference between supply and return air) and an overall reduction 
in kWh and Watts per ton of 16.9%, which are other measurable way to view the thermodynamic 
enhancement of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. 
The tables of data and financial calculations are available for review at the end of this report.
