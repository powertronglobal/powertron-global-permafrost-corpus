Energy Reporting Period (Post)
The identical IPMVP data recordings from the baseline were recorded on 9/20/2012 using the same 
recently NIST calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy.  Given the 10.9% cooler outside air 
temperature in the Post, the compressors Amps (70% of the total Amps) were adjusted upward by the same 
amount.  This adjustment permeates through to the Post kW as well as the kW per Ton.  The measurements 
are as follows:
Results
The following are the final calculated performance measurements (detailed below the chart) after 
performing the regression analysis to account to the restored capacity brought about by PermaFrost NMR®.
