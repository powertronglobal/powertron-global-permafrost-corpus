Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to determine a very accurate ROI for 
the Air Force for implementing this ECM:
kW per ton Baseline = 1.17 kW/ton * 85.3 tons = 100.1 kW
Annual kWh Baseline 100.1 kW * 4820 hours = 482,482 kWh
Annual Cost Baseline = 482,482 kWh * .11 cents = $53,073
Regression Analysis is then used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Pilot Unit  
Adjusted Baseline Tonnage = 88.6 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted kW per ton Baseline = 1.17 * 88.6 tons = 103.7 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh = 103.7 * 4820 Annual Operating Hrs = 499,834 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline = 499,834 kWh * $.11 = $54,982
kW per ton ERP = .94 kW/ton * 88.6 tons = 83.3 kW
Normalized Annual kWh ERP 83.3 kW * 4820 hours = 401,506 kWh
Normalized Annual Cost ERP = 401,596 kWh * .11 cents = $44,166
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Month = ($54,982 - $44,166) /12 = $901.33
Cost of PermaFrost NMR™ installed @ $11,250 / $901.33 = 12.5 months
 
ROI = 12.5 months
