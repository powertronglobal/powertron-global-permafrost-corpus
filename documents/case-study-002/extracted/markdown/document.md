PermaFrost NMR® Chiller Report
Military Base A - Main Chiller Plant - Chiller #3

September 22, 2012

Executive Summary

This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure

(ECM) PermaFrost NMR® in chiller #3 of the main chiller plant at Military Base A in MD.  Detailed

forensic performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on a nominal 170-ton water

cooled chiller using R-123 refrigerant serving the Defense Support Contractor.

[Government Services Director], Deputy Director of Government Services for [Energy Services Company], personally witnessed all phases of the

testing and data collection. Following testing, the unit was treated with the proper amount and type of

PermaFrost NMR® product formulated for chiller systems.

The improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at the chiller was solely attributable to

the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. It now provides colder supply air with warmer refrigerant.  This greater

efficiency in refrigerant approach is due to the restoration of

the heat transfer ability of the evaporator and condenser coils.

Following treatment with PermaFrost NMR®, while operating

at 100% load, the chiller showed a 16.8% reduction in kW and a

17.3% reduction in Amps while at the same time producing an

increase of 39,600 Btuh or 3.9% more tonnage.  The chiller also

showed a substantial reduction in kW/Ton of 20% and a 25%

improvement in COP.  Additionally, the chiller showed a

22.1% improvement in approach, which is another measurable

way to view the thermodynamic enhancement of the

PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result of the average ECM

improvements is an ROI to Military Base A of just 12.5 months based on

the runtime information taken directly off the data logger on

the chiller.  The tables of data and financial calculations are

available for review at the end of this report.

Product Brief

PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure

(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) technology as its core agent.  A sustainable,

one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any

type of system in which it is installed – DX (direct expansion air and chilled water systems), Chillers

(screw, reciprocating, scroll and centrifugal), heat pumps, ice making equipment.  Specialized

applications include computer room cooling and dehumidification systems, chiller plants (water and ice

production applications), domestic and industrial refrigeration (ammonia low and ultra low

temperature), air-cooled single application water chillers and split and package rooftop HVAC

equipment.

The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and

improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allows a system to achieve set point temperatures in a more

rapid fashion which reduces system loading and operating periods.  The indirect benefits resulting from

the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW

hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, less metallic wear, longer overall equipment life and a

reduced carbon footprint for the Air Force.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol

The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocols (IPMVP) are used to develop this

report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and

Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the

IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and

products.

There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize.  They

are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.  Option B is

defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single

source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM

affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.

Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the

savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term

measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained.  The savings are calculated by

short-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using

measurements of proxies of energy use.

The final computation follows the formula:

Energy Science Division

Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy

+ - Routine adjustments + - Non-Routine Adjustments

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content

The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the

effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces.

A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the unit’s operational

conditions were satisfactory.  Baseline measurements were recorded and then the proper amount and type

of PermaFrost NMR® was injected.  The product was then allowed three (3) weeks to seat itself into the

metal surfaces before post measurements were taken again to establish the efficiency gains.

The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP International Performance Measurement and

Verification Protocol as the M&V plan.  The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global’s Senior

Energy Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer], ME/CEM/CMC/CMVP and witnessed by [Senior Mechanical Technician], Senior

Mechanical Technician for the Defense Support Contractor.

The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:

kW = Volts * Amps * 1.47 (Power Factor .85 *1.732)/1000 - for 3-Phase

Operating Tons / Hour = (GPM x 8.34 x 60 x Chilled Water Delta) / 12,000

kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage

COP = (12 / kW per Ton / 3.412)

Energy Reporting Period (Post)

The identical IPMVP data recordings from the baseline were recorded on 9/20/2012 using the same

recently NIST calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy.  Given the 10.9% cooler outside air

temperature in the Post, the compressors Amps (70% of the total Amps) were adjusted upward by the same

amount.  This adjustment permeates through to the Post kW as well as the kW per Ton.  The measurements

are as follows:

Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to determine a very accurate ROI for

the Air Force for implementing this ECM:

kW per ton Baseline = 1.17 kW/ton * 85.3 tons = 100.1 kW

Annual kWh Baseline 100.1 kW * 4820 hours = 482,482 kWh

Annual Cost Baseline = 482,482 kWh * .11 cents = $53,073

Regression Analysis is then used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Pilot Unit

Adjusted Baseline Tonnage = 88.6 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)

Adjusted kW per ton Baseline = 1.17 * 88.6 tons = 103.7 kW

Adjusted Baseline kWh = 103.7 * 4820 Annual Operating Hrs = 499,834 kWh

Revised Cost to Run Baseline = 499,834 kWh * $.11 = $54,982

kW per ton ERP = .94 kW/ton * 88.6 tons = 83.3 kW

Normalized Annual kWh ERP 83.3 kW * 4820 hours = 401,506 kWh

Normalized Annual Cost ERP = 401,596 kWh * .11 cents = $44,166

Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Month = ($54,982 - $44,166) /12 = $901.33

Cost of PermaFrost NMR™ installed @ $11,250 / $901.33 = 12.5 months

ROI = 12.5 months
