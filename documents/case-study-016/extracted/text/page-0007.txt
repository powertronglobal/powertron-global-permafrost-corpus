The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
BTUH = CFM * 1.08  * Dry Bulb Delta
 
kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
 
Percentage Eﬃciency = Measured BTUH / Manufacturers Design BTUH
 
Coeﬃcient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)

System Description / Design Characteristics
These units provide critical cooling for the Major Food Manufacturer Provisions Distribution Center located 17 Parkway 
Place, Edison, NJ.  Given the required internal load of the facility, it is estimated that the system runs ~4,500 
hours or more each per year prior to the ECM being implemented.
