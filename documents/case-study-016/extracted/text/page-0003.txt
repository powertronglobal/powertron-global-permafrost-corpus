COP of 53.9%. All of these factors directly correlate to 
what Major Food Manufacturer will realize in energy savings as they 
operate this refrigeration system in the future as well as 
other HVACR equipment like Roof Top Units and Chillers 
under the similar parameters.
Following treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® 
technology, the two CRAC units also showed a slight 
reduction in measured Amps while at the same time 
producing more cooling. This is illustrated by the 46.5% 
increase in the combined entering and leaving Dry Bulb 
Delta in the Post versus the Baseline, which is a critical 
refrigeration measurement used to determine the 
thermodynamic enhancement brought about by the 
PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result of the ECM 
improvement is an ROI to Major Food Manufacturer that is measured in 
a few short months. The tables of data used to determine 
the financial payback are available for review at the end of 
this report.

Unit #4 of 7 total units supporting this distribution 
facility was put into service 1998. It serves two 
evaporator coils inside the loading dock area. Evaporator 
R is located near the end of the dock where the smaller 
vans pull in and more outside air gets in. Evaporator L 
(pictured above) is closer to the middle of the dock and 
right above the opening to the cooler area. While Unit #9 
on right has been in operation since 2007. The difference 
in age and total runtime clearly presented itself during 
the testing since both are key variables directly related to 
the amount thermal inefficiency in a system and the 
corresponding loss of performance over time.
