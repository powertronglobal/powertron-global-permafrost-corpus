Baseline & Post Measurements
The identical IPMVP following data points were recorded for Baseline and Post on 7/15/13 and 8/5/13 
respectively using recently NIST calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. The Return Air dry 
bulb entering the coil were very similar in both periods as were the discharge pressures of the compressor 
so no adjustments were made to the calculations. The measurements are as follows:
