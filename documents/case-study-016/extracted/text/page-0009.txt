The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period of Refrigeration System #4 prior to using regression analysis. 
PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for Major Food Manufacturer
Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Major Food Manufacturer 
for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This greater capacity reduces the runtime hours and in turn 
reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post. The true ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the units 
was when operating at their original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of tonnage and then 
subtracting the new cost to run the units at this same newly restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was 
installed. This regression calculation is the most scientific method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the 
units will now run due to their increased capacity which allows the units to reach set temperatures quicker and shut 
off sooner.
Avg. Adjusted kW Baseline        3.265 kW/ton * 8.88 tons = 28.99 kW
Avg. Adjusted Baseline kWh        28.99 kW * 4,500 Annual Operating Hrs = 130,455 kWh
Avg. Revised Cost to Run Baseline        130,455 kWh * $.12 = $15,654.60
