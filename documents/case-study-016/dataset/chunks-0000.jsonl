This system supplies two large \nevaporators. Detailed forensic performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the \nentire system using R22 as the refrigerant. Following testing, the system was treated with the proper \namount and type of the PermaFrost NMR® technology specially formulated for these types of refrigeration \nsystems.  Measurement and Verification (M&V) was conducted pre-installation and post-gestation.\nThe improvement in efficiency and restored capacity \ngained directly at the units was solely attributable to the \nPermaFrost NMR® ECM. This is a result of the reversal of \nthermal inefficiency on heat exchange surfaces.  \nFollowing treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® \ntechnology, the refrigeration system showed an effective \nnet average 35% reduction in kW/ton based on the exact \ncapacity measured in the baseline M&V and the post \ngestation M&V when operating at 100% load. The effective \nkWh dropped by 4.8% while simultaneously producing an \naverage increase in system efficiency of 46.5%. Prior to the \nECM, the evaporators combined produced 6.06 tons of \ncooling as measured in-situ, or 66% of design. After the \nECM, the average combined tonnage produced increased \nto 8.88 tons or 96.7% of original design specifications. This \n46.5% average capacity increase from the baseline \nperformance levels led to an effective average increase in \nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 574, "chars": 2617, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_025_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:3fe2d9e2dc3124c30ab6d3fa928ffb03b7c42ae068fbb4f69a02fdd01ae91418"}

All of these factors directly correlate to \nwhat Major Food Manufacturer will realize in energy savings as they \noperate this refrigeration system in the future as well as \nother HVACR equipment like Roof Top Units and Chillers \nunder the similar parameters.\nFollowing treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® \ntechnology, the two CRAC units also showed a slight \nreduction in measured Amps while at the same time \nproducing more cooling. This is illustrated by the 46.5% \nincrease in the combined entering and leaving Dry Bulb \nDelta in the Post versus the Baseline, which is a critical \nrefrigeration measurement used to determine the \nthermodynamic enhancement brought about by the \nPermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result of the ECM \nimprovement is an ROI to Major Food Manufacturer that is measured in \na few short months. The tables of data used to determine \nthe financial payback are available for review at the end of \nthis report. \nEnergy Science Division\nUnit #4 of 7 total units supporting this distribution \nfacility was put into service 1998. It serves two \nevaporator coils inside the loading dock area. Evaporator \nR is located near the end of the dock where the smaller \nvans pull in and more outside air gets in. Evaporator L \n(pictured above) is closer to the middle of the dock and \nright above the opening to the cooler area. While Unit #9 \non right has been in operation since 2007. The difference \nin age and total runtime clearly presented itself during \nthe testing since both are key variables directly related to \nthe amount thermal inefficiency in a system and the \ncorresponding loss of performance over time. \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 493, "chars": 2236, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_025_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_025_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:633f9582a3d8e1940a9f18f847b2f12dbed3dc729625143a534219ca1a7eebc4"}

A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for at least 10 years in any \ntype of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and \nequipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); \nchilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia \nrefrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The \nequipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single \nand multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® in any type of HVACR system are improved cooling \nperformance, increased capacity and improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to \nachieve set point temperatures in a more rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. \nThe indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment \ninclude reduced run time, less kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life \ncycle time and a reduced carbon footprint for Major Food Manufacturer.\nEnergy Science Division\nBOUNDARY LAYER\nOIL REMOVED\nBEFORE TREATMENT\nAFTER TREATMENT\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 440, "chars": 2084, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_025_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_025_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:bc9973cd41908ccf67a25311c6b36c8c0509015ba6ef08f517bcfcd4f20b4738"}

The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating, \nRefrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization \n(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation \nmethods and products.\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is \ndefined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single \nsource of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM \naffected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations \nusing measurements of proxies of energy use. \nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+/ - Routine adjustments  + /- Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 436, "chars": 2153, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_025_chunk_0003", "next_id": "pdf_025_chunk_0005", "content_hash": "sha256:8e0a451d7c6b4ededafd342ae55128f650f6791b7ebf4828605961da6e7c24d5"}

Baseline M&V were recorded \non both evaporators and the supporting compressor and \nthen the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® \nwas injected. The gestation period for the Major Food Manufacturer pilot \nwas just 3 weeks due to the heavy amount of runtime the \nsystem gets. Prior to taking Post measurements, systems \nneed to achieve ~250 hours of runtime to ensure adequate \nperformance improvement time. At the end of this \ngestation period, Post M&V results were taken in the \nidentical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same or very similar entering air dry \nbulb and compressor discharge pressures. These are two of the most critical variables to contend with in an \nin-situ refrigeration testing situation. When analyzing all of the data baseline and post data, no adjustments \nfor weather were necessary. \nThe following report produces the utilization of the International Performance Measurement and \nVerification Protocol (IPMVP) as the M&V plan.
