PermaFrost NMR® Performance Report
Major Food Manufacturer
August, 2013 
Executive Summary
         This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure 
(ECM) PermaFrost NMR® into one of seven refrigeration systems supporting the critical Major Food Manufacturer 
Provisions refrigerated  distribution facility at 17 Parkway Place, Edison, NJ. This system supplies two large 
evaporators. Detailed forensic performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the 
entire system using R22 as the refrigerant. Following testing, the system was treated with the proper 
amount and type of the PermaFrost NMR® technology specially formulated for these types of refrigeration 
systems.  Measurement and Verification (M&V) was conducted pre-installation and post-gestation.
The improvement in efficiency and restored capacity 
gained directly at the units was solely attributable to the 
PermaFrost NMR® ECM. This is a result of the reversal of 
thermal inefficiency on heat exchange surfaces.  
Following treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® 
technology, the refrigeration system showed an effective 
net average 35% reduction in kW/ton based on the exact 
capacity measured in the baseline M&V and the post 
gestation M&V when operating at 100% load. The effective 
kWh dropped by 4.8% while simultaneously producing an 
average increase in system efficiency of 46.5%. Prior to the 
ECM, the evaporators combined produced 6.06 tons of 
cooling as measured in-situ, or 66% of design. After the 
ECM, the average combined tonnage produced increased 
to 8.88 tons or 96.7% of original design specifications. This 
46.5% average capacity increase from the baseline 
performance levels led to an effective average increase in

COP of 53.9%. All of these factors directly correlate to 
what Major Food Manufacturer will realize in energy savings as they 
operate this refrigeration system in the future as well as 
other HVACR equipment like Roof Top Units and Chillers 
under the similar parameters.
Following treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® 
technology, the two CRAC units also showed a slight 
reduction in measured Amps while at the same time 
producing more cooling. This is illustrated by the 46.5% 
increase in the combined entering and leaving Dry Bulb 
Delta in the Post versus the Baseline, which is a critical 
refrigeration measurement used to determine the 
thermodynamic enhancement brought about by the 
PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result of the ECM 
improvement is an ROI to Major Food Manufacturer that is measured in 
a few short months. The tables of data used to determine 
the financial payback are available for review at the end of 
this report. 
Energy Science Division
Unit #4 of 7 total units supporting this distribution 
facility was put into service 1998. It serves two 
evaporator coils inside the loading dock area. Evaporator 
R is located near the end of the dock where the smaller 
vans pull in and more outside air gets in. Evaporator L 
(pictured above) is closer to the middle of the dock and 
right above the opening to the cooler area. While Unit #9 
on right has been in operation since 2007. The difference 
in age and total runtime clearly presented itself during 
the testing since both are key variables directly related to 
the amount thermal inefficiency in a system and the 
corresponding loss of performance over time.

Product Brief
         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure 
(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative® (NMR™) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, 
one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for at least 10 years in any 
type of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and 
equipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); 
chilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia 
refrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The 
equipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single 
and multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® in any type of HVACR system are improved cooling 
performance, increased capacity and improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to 
achieve set point temperatures in a more rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. 
The indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment 
include reduced run time, less kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life 
cycle time and a reduced carbon footprint for Major Food Manufacturer.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) was utilized in the 
development of this report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating, 
Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization 
(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation 
methods and products.
There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They 
are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is 
defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single 
source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM 
affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term 
measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by 
short-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations 
using measurements of proxies of energy use. 
The final computation follows the formula:
Energy Science Division
Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces. 
A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was 
implemented to determine if the operational conditions of 
the system was satisfactory. Baseline M&V were recorded 
on both evaporators and the supporting compressor and 
then the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® 
was injected. The gestation period for the Major Food Manufacturer pilot 
was just 3 weeks due to the heavy amount of runtime the 
system gets. Prior to taking Post measurements, systems 
need to achieve ~250 hours of runtime to ensure adequate 
performance improvement time. At the end of this 
gestation period, Post M&V results were taken in the 
identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same or very similar entering air dry 
bulb and compressor discharge pressures. These are two of the most critical variables to contend with in an 
in-situ refrigeration testing situation. When analyzing all of the data baseline and post data, no adjustments 
for weather were necessary. 
The following report produces the utilization of the International Performance Measurement and 
Verification Protocol (IPMVP) as the M&V plan. Major Food Manufacturer Distribution Manager [Client Representative] and 
S&S Refrigeration Engineer & Owner, Charles Sternberg witnessed the collection of all the data used in this 
report. The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global®’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer, 
[Senior Energy Engineer].

Results
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period of Refrigeration System #4 prior to using regression analysis. 
PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for Major Food Manufacturer
Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Major Food Manufacturer 
for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This greater capacity reduces the runtime hours and in turn 
reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post. The true ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the units 
was when operating at their original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of tonnage and then 
subtracting the new cost to run the units at this same newly restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was 
installed. This regression calculation is the most scientific method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the 
units will now run due to their increased capacity which allows the units to reach set temperatures quicker and shut 
off sooner.
Avg. Adjusted kW Baseline        3.265 kW/ton * 8.88 tons = 28.99 kW
Avg. Adjusted Baseline kWh        28.99 kW * 4,500 Annual Operating Hrs = 130,455 kWh
Avg. Revised Cost to Run Baseline        130,455 kWh * $.12 = $15,654.60
