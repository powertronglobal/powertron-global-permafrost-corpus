Detailed Results for US Internet Provider CRAC Units
System Description / Design Characteristics
The two pilot units provide cooling to one of several tenant suites comprising the US Internet Provider Data Center facility. 
The Control CRAC unit is the workhorse unit in a totally separate suite. Given the internal load of the suite and 
the lifetime run hours on the system, it is estimated that the systems run a minimum of ~5,870 hours or more 
each per year prior to the ECM being implemented.  
Baseline and Post Measurements
The identical IPMVP following data points were recorded for Baseline and AERP on 25 September 2013 and 
24 October 2013 respectively using recently calibrated devices by NIST (National Institutes of Standards and 
Technology) to insure measurement accuracy. CRAC units #3 and #4 also has a measured amount of airflow 
less than design passing through the coil. The Control CRAC unit was more in line with design. The 
measurements are as follows:
