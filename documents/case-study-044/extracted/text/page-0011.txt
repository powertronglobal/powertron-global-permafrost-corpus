US Internet Provider Saving More than just Energy at its Park Place Location
By treating just the two pilot CRAC units and the one control CRAC unit with PermaFrost NMR®, US Internet Provider has 
saved approximately 159,282 kWh per year and all the costs associated with those savings – and this doesn’t count 
all the other CRAC units that were treated in the facility. From an environmental impact standpoint, US Internet Provider is 
also beneﬁtting the surrounding community. 
The 159,282 kWh saved per year equates to the following:
           Prevention of 112 metric tons of CO2 emissions
           Equivalent of removing annual greenhouse gas emissions from 23.4 passenger vehicles
           CO2  emissions from the electricity use of 15.5 homes for a year
           Greenhouse gas emissions avoided by recycling 42.1 tons of waste instead of sending it to a landﬁll
           CO2 emissions from 12,599 gallons of gasoline consumed
