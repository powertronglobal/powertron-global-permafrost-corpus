PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for US Internet Provider
Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for US Internet Provider 
for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This greater capacity reduces the runtime hours and in turn 
reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post. The true ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the units 
was when operating at their original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of tonnage and then 
subtracting the new cost to run the units at this same newly restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM 
was installed. This regression calculation is the most scientific method of accounting for the reduced number of hours 
the units will now run due to their increased capacity which allows the units to reach set temperatures quicker and 
shut off sooner.   
Since this regression analysis involves two units, the average kW/ton and total tons are used to calculate an average 
ROI across both units.
Adjusted kW Baseline        1.5 kW/ton * 20.765 tons = 31.148 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh        31.148 kW * 5,870 Annual Operating Hrs = 182,839 kWh per CRAC unit
Revised Cost to Run Baseline        182,839 kWh * $.09 = $16,455.51 per CRAC unit
kW Post        1.06 kW/ton * 20.765 tons = 22.01 kW per CRAC unit
Annual kWh Post         22.01 kW * 5,870 hours = 129,199 kWh per CRAC unit
Annual Cost Post         129,199 kWh * $.09 = $11,627.91 per CRAC unit
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Month       ($16,455.51 - $11,627.91) / 12 = $402.30 per unit
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in two pilot systems        $5,000.00
Estimated Energy Savings Payback Period for US Internet Provider        $5000 / $804.60 = 6.21 months
