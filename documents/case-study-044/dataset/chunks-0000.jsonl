Measurement and Verification (M&V) \nreadings were collected and compiled in accordance \nwith the IPMVP (International Measurement and \nVerification Protocol) framework pre-installation and \npost-gestation by the Powertron Global’s Director of \nEngineering, [Senior Energy Engineer]. Frank Wilcox, \nUS Internet Provider Data Center Manager, and Ralph Moore, \nChief Technician for US Internet Provider oversaw the process. Jay \nEvans, US Internet Provider’s senior on-site technician provided \ndirect support to the team. This same US Internet Provider \nmanagement team also selected a third unit to serve as \na blind control unit when the M&V team returned for \nthe avoided energy reporting period (AERP) readings. \nThis control unit was installed at the same time as the \ntwo pilot units and provided US Internet Provider with additional \nevidence that the ECM worked the same in all the units.\nEnergy Science Division\nAn image of one of the 20-ton Leibert CRAC units involved \nin the PermaFrost NMR® pilot. \nPowertron’s Director of Engineering goes over baseline \nIPMVP results with US Internet Provider Managers.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 596, "chars": 2777, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_046_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:818f8dd6f20679ffb22d16f585b9d9daf0c47ab6ea547d61e070c5d30e40f7ad"}

The CFM in the control unit was much closer to its design. However, this pilot is \nall about showing the delta effects resulting from improving the thermal dynamic characteristics of the \nCRAC units which are clearly evident in the performance data stated below. The improvement in \nefficiency and restored capacity gained directly at the units was solely attributable to the PermaFrost \nNMR® ECM. This is a result of the reversal of thermal inefficiency on heat exchange surfaces.  \nFollowing treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, units 3 and 4 showed an effective reduction \nin kW of 6.1% and 10.7% respectively based on the exact capacity measured in the baseline M&V and \nAERP M&V periods when operating at 100% load. The effective annual kWh were reduced by 63,707 in \nunit 3 and 42,558 in unit 4, equating to a combined 29.2% reduction while simultaneously producing a \ntotal increase of 9.57 tons. This equates to an average 30% increase in tonnage across both units and a \nreduction in average kW/ton of 29.2%. Prior to the ECM, the units produced a combined 31.96 tons of \ncooling as measured in-situ. After the ECM, the tonnage produced increased to 41.53 tons. This 30% \ncapacity increase from the baseline performance levels, in combination with other related improvements, \nled to an effective increase in COP across both units of 42.2%. All of these factors directly correlate to \nwhat US Internet Provider will realize in energy savings as they operate this and other facility CRAC units in the \nfuture under similar parameters. As a case in point, the 22-ton control CRAC unit selected at random by \nUS Internet Provider was measured in-situ after treatment to be producing 20.84 tons of cooling, or 95% of design.\nFollowing treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, the two pilot CRAC units also showed average \nreduction in amp draw of 8.4% and a 32.4% reduction in the average refrigeration approach while at the \nsame time producing 30% more cooling. All the measurements mentioned combine to reflect the \nthermodynamic enhancement brought about by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. The result of the ECM \nimprovement is an ROI to US Internet Provider that is measured in under a year. The tables of data used to \ndetermine the financial payback are available for review at the end of this report. \nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 712, "chars": 3176, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_046_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_046_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:58e8bf1cc84ca72ae6d4535cc2059f8c607f45a15e3cea84d4e3a7aa0ab24f28"}

A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining useful life of \nany system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and \nequipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); \nchilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia \nrefrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The \nequipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single \nand multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® in any type of HVACR system are improved cooling \nperformance, increased capacity and improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to \nachieve set point temperatures in a more rapid fashion, or in the case of CRAC units, unload, all of \nwhich reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced \nthermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW hours used, less \namp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time, and as depicted at the end of this \ndocument, a reduced carbon footprint for US Internet Provider across their portfolio.\nEnergy Science Division\nBOUNDARY LAYER\nOIL REMOVED\nBEFORE TREATMENT\nAFTER TREATMENT\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 483, "chars": 2287, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_046_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_046_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:5cffca5190436bb98387d50871a6eb85be1cfe79f0c17af9bcbeea093a98ffd8"}

The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The \nAmerican Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency \nValuation Organization (EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness \nof ECM’s and products. \nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is \ndefined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single \nsource of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM \naffected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period. For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations \nusing measurements of proxies of energy use. \nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+/ - Routine Adjustments +/ - Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 427, "chars": 2082, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_046_chunk_0003", "next_id": "pdf_046_chunk_0005", "content_hash": "sha256:9fc4125dbc32b4732a90e1235c929150c9e69a7896a9c3544f2c5d99bbfb4133"}

The gestation \nperiod for the US Internet Provider pilot was four (4) weeks. Prior to taking \nAERP measurements, systems need to achieve ~300 hours of \nruntime to ensure adequate performance improvement time. At \nthe end of this gestation period, AERP M&V results were taken \nin the identical manner as in the baseline.  For the Control CRAC \nunit, only post readings were taken as it was randomly selected \nby US Internet Provider management to be checked to see what its new \nperformance efficiency after treatment with PermaFrost NMR®.\nIncoming condenser water to each of the units was carefully \nmetered to ensure it was the same temperature in both data \ncollection periods. This action also allowed the discharge \npressures of the compressors to be very similar so no \nadjustments were necessary for weather. \nThe following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan.\nThe results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas: \n \nkW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) \n \nTon = (Airﬂow * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta) / 12,000 \n \nkW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage \n \nCoeﬃcient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)\nEnergy Science Division\nThe M&V team collects critical IPMVP \nmeasurements such as air flow and pressure drop \nacross the coil using the latest, most accurate digital \nNIST calibrated testing equipment as part of the \nscientific PermaFrost NMR® performance pilot.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 566, "chars": 2479, "pages": {"start": 5, "end": 6}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_046_chunk_0004", "next_id": "pdf_046_chunk_0006", "content_hash": "sha256:6bd21b20e1c898ec4792b26c939688d4eb84b0e0e0cebc3eae3438701ae16fc1"}
