PermaFrost NMR® Eﬃciency Report
US Internet Provider CRAC Units
November, 2013
Executive Summary
         This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy conservation method 
(ECM) PermaFrost NMR® into two Leibert Computer Room Air Conditioning (CRAC) units using R22 
refrigerant supporting the US Internet Provider data center located in downtown [Southeast Location].
Detailed forensic performance testing (outlined later in 
this report) was performed on the two pilot CRAC 
units to determine their suitability for testing and their 
performance capability after 14 years in service. 
Following testing, these CRAC units, as well as all the 
other CRAC units in the facility, were treated with the 
proper amount and type of the PermaFrost NMR® 
technology specially formulated for these types of 
machines. Measurement and Verification (M&V) 
readings were collected and compiled in accordance 
with the IPMVP (International Measurement and 
Verification Protocol) framework pre-installation and 
post-gestation by the Powertron Global’s Director of 
Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer]. Frank Wilcox, 
US Internet Provider Data Center Manager, and Ralph Moore, 
Chief Technician for US Internet Provider oversaw the process. Jay 
Evans, US Internet Provider’s senior on-site technician provided 
direct support to the team. This same US Internet Provider 
management team also selected a third unit to serve as 
a blind control unit when the M&V team returned for 
the avoided energy reporting period (AERP) readings. 
This control unit was installed at the same time as the 
two pilot units and provided US Internet Provider with additional 
evidence that the ECM worked the same in all the units.

It should be noted when reading through this report that the two pilot CRAC units had lower than 
design airflow measured across the coils which contributes to the slightly higher deltas seen in the 
baseline measurements. The CFM in the control unit was much closer to its design. However, this pilot is 
all about showing the delta effects resulting from improving the thermal dynamic characteristics of the 
CRAC units which are clearly evident in the performance data stated below. The improvement in 
efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at the units was solely attributable to the PermaFrost 
NMR® ECM. This is a result of the reversal of thermal inefficiency on heat exchange surfaces.  
Following treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, units 3 and 4 showed an effective reduction 
in kW of 6.1% and 10.7% respectively based on the exact capacity measured in the baseline M&V and 
AERP M&V periods when operating at 100% load. The effective annual kWh were reduced by 63,707 in 
unit 3 and 42,558 in unit 4, equating to a combined 29.2% reduction while simultaneously producing a 
total increase of 9.57 tons. This equates to an average 30% increase in tonnage across both units and a 
reduction in average kW/ton of 29.2%. Prior to the ECM, the units produced a combined 31.96 tons of 
cooling as measured in-situ. After the ECM, the tonnage produced increased to 41.53 tons. This 30% 
capacity increase from the baseline performance levels, in combination with other related improvements, 
led to an effective increase in COP across both units of 42.2%. All of these factors directly correlate to 
what US Internet Provider will realize in energy savings as they operate this and other facility CRAC units in the 
future under similar parameters. As a case in point, the 22-ton control CRAC unit selected at random by 
US Internet Provider was measured in-situ after treatment to be producing 20.84 tons of cooling, or 95% of design.
Following treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, the two pilot CRAC units also showed average 
reduction in amp draw of 8.4% and a 32.4% reduction in the average refrigeration approach while at the 
same time producing 30% more cooling. All the measurements mentioned combine to reflect the 
thermodynamic enhancement brought about by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. The result of the ECM 
improvement is an ROI to US Internet Provider that is measured in under a year. The tables of data used to 
determine the financial payback are available for review at the end of this report.

Product Brief
         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure 
(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative® (NMR™) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, 
one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining useful life of 
any system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and 
equipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); 
chilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia 
refrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The 
equipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single 
and multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® in any type of HVACR system are improved cooling 
performance, increased capacity and improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to 
achieve set point temperatures in a more rapid fashion, or in the case of CRAC units, unload, all of 
which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced 
thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW hours used, less 
amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time, and as depicted at the end of this 
document, a reduced carbon footprint for US Internet Provider across their portfolio.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol
The IPMVP was utilized in the development of this report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The 
American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency 
Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness 
of ECM’s and products. 
There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They 
are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is 
defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single 
source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM 
affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period. For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term 
measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by 
short-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations 
using measurements of proxies of energy use. 
The final computation follows the formula:
Energy Science Division
Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy
+/ - Routine Adjustments +/ - Non-Routine Adjustments

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces. 
Following a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to determine the operational condition of the 
CRAC units was satisfactory, Baseline M&V data was collected and recorded prior to the proper amount 
and type of PermaFrost NMR® being injected. The gestation 
period for the US Internet Provider pilot was four (4) weeks. Prior to taking 
AERP measurements, systems need to achieve ~300 hours of 
runtime to ensure adequate performance improvement time. At 
the end of this gestation period, AERP M&V results were taken 
in the identical manner as in the baseline.  For the Control CRAC 
unit, only post readings were taken as it was randomly selected 
by US Internet Provider management to be checked to see what its new 
performance efficiency after treatment with PermaFrost NMR®.
Incoming condenser water to each of the units was carefully 
metered to ensure it was the same temperature in both data 
collection periods. This action also allowed the discharge 
pressures of the compressors to be very similar so no 
adjustments were necessary for weather. 
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan.
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas: 
 
kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
Ton = (Airﬂow * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta) / 12,000 
 
kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
 
Coeﬃcient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
Energy Science Division
The M&V team collects critical IPMVP 
measurements such as air flow and pressure drop 
across the coil using the latest, most accurate digital 
NIST calibrated testing equipment as part of the 
scientific PermaFrost NMR® performance pilot.

Detailed Results for US Internet Provider CRAC Units
System Description / Design Characteristics
The two pilot units provide cooling to one of several tenant suites comprising the US Internet Provider Data Center facility. 
The Control CRAC unit is the workhorse unit in a totally separate suite. Given the internal load of the suite and 
the lifetime run hours on the system, it is estimated that the systems run a minimum of ~5,870 hours or more 
each per year prior to the ECM being implemented.  
Baseline and Post Measurements
The identical IPMVP following data points were recorded for Baseline and AERP on 25 September 2013 and 
24 October 2013 respectively using recently calibrated devices by NIST (National Institutes of Standards and 
Technology) to insure measurement accuracy. CRAC units #3 and #4 also has a measured amount of airflow 
less than design passing through the coil. The Control CRAC unit was more in line with design. The

PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for US Internet Provider
Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for US Internet Provider 
for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This greater capacity reduces the runtime hours and in turn 
reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post. The true ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the units 
was when operating at their original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of tonnage and then 
subtracting the new cost to run the units at this same newly restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM 
was installed. This regression calculation is the most scientific method of accounting for the reduced number of hours 
the units will now run due to their increased capacity which allows the units to reach set temperatures quicker and 
shut off sooner.   
Since this regression analysis involves two units, the average kW/ton and total tons are used to calculate an average 
ROI across both units.
Adjusted kW Baseline        1.5 kW/ton * 20.765 tons = 31.148 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh        31.148 kW * 5,870 Annual Operating Hrs = 182,839 kWh per CRAC unit
Revised Cost to Run Baseline        182,839 kWh * $.09 = $16,455.51 per CRAC unit
kW Post        1.06 kW/ton * 20.765 tons = 22.01 kW per CRAC unit
Annual kWh Post         22.01 kW * 5,870 hours = 129,199 kWh per CRAC unit
Annual Cost Post         129,199 kWh * $.09 = $11,627.91 per CRAC unit
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Month       ($16,455.51 - $11,627.91) / 12 = $402.30 per unit
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in two pilot systems        $5,000.00
Estimated Energy Savings Payback Period for US Internet Provider        $5000 / $804.60 = 6.21 months

US Internet Provider Saving More than just Energy at its Park Place Location
By treating just the two pilot CRAC units and the one control CRAC unit with PermaFrost NMR®, US Internet Provider has 
saved approximately 159,282 kWh per year and all the costs associated with those savings – and this doesn’t count 
all the other CRAC units that were treated in the facility. From an environmental impact standpoint, US Internet Provider is 
also beneﬁtting the surrounding community. 
The 159,282 kWh saved per year equates to the following:
           Prevention of 112 metric tons of CO2 emissions
           Equivalent of removing annual greenhouse gas emissions from 23.4 passenger vehicles
           CO2  emissions from the electricity use of 15.5 homes for a year
           Greenhouse gas emissions avoided by recycling 42.1 tons of waste instead of sending it to a landﬁll
           CO2 emissions from 12,599 gallons of gasoline consumed
