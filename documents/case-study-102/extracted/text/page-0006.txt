       Detailed Results for 50-Ton Split System
System Description / Design Characteristics
This system provides critical cooling for the Global Flavor/Fragrance Company manufacturing facility located 300 North Street, 
Teterboro, NJ.  Given the required internal load of the facility and weather BIN data, it is estimated that the 
system runs ~4,500 hours or more per year prior to the ECM being implemented.  
Baseline & Energy Reporting (Post) Periods
The identical IPMVP following data points were recorded for Baseline 
and Post on 8/6/13 and 9/4/13 respectively using recently NIST 
calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. The return wet and 
dry bulb temperatures entering the coil were very similar in both 
periods as were the discharge pressures of the compressor so no 
adjustments were made to the calculations. The measurements are as 
follows:
