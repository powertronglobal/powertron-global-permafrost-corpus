PermaFrost NMR® Post measurement period of the split system.  
PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for Global Flavor/Fragrance Company
Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Global Flavor/Fragrance Company for 
implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy savings 
resulting from the improvement in capacity. This greater capacity reduces the runtime hours and in turn reduces the annual 
kWh expended in the Post. The true ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the system was when operating at its 
original energy profile then subtracting the cost to operate the system at its newly restored energy profile less the percentage of 
increased capacity. This regression calculation is the most scientific method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the 
units will now run due to their increased capacity which allows the units to reach set temperatures quicker and shut off sooner. 
Baseline kWh        59.41 kW * 4,500 Annual Operating Hrs = 267,345 kWh
Cost to Run Baseline        267,345 kWh * $.128 = $34,220.16
Post ECM kWh        59.36 kW * 4,500 Annual Operating Hrs = 267,120 kWh
Revised kWh (based on 10% restored capacity)        267,120 kWh * (1 - .1) = 240,408 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Post        240,408 kWh * $.128 = $30,772.22
Avoided Energy Costs (Savings) Per Month        ($34,220.16 - $30,772.22) / 12 = $287.33
Cost of ECM        $6,250
ROI        $6,250 / $287.33 = 21.8 
 
  ROI = 22 months
