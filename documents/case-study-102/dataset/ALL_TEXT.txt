PermaFrost NMR® Eﬃciency Report
Global Flavor/Fragrance Company 
September, 2013 
Executive Summary
         This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure (ECM) 
PermaFrost NMR® into a critical 50-ton HVAC split system supporting the Global Flavor/Fragrance Company blending and mixing 
area in their national headquarters and manufacturing plant facility at 300 North Street, Teterboro, NJ.  
Detailed forensic performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the entire system using 
R22 as the refrigerant. Following testing, the system was treated with the proper amount and type of the 
PermaFrost NMR® technology specially formulated for these types of systems.  Measurement and 
Verification (M&V) was conducted pre-installation and post-gestation. The purpose of the testing was to 1) 
show how the ECM improves the thermal performance of any system it is installed in, and 2) show that the 
ECM is safe and will not harm Global Flavor/Fragrance Company’s HVACR 
equipment.
The improvement in efficiency and restored 
capacity gained directly at the unit was solely 
attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. This 
is a result of the reversal of thermal inefficiency on heat 
exchange surfaces.  
Following treatment with the ECM, the split 
system showed an effective net 9.1% reduction in 
kW/ton based on the exact capacity measured in 
the baseline M&V and the post gestation M&V 
when operating at 100% load. The ECM also produced an average increase cooling capacity of 10% or 6.16 
tons. Prior to the ECM, the system produced 61.62 tons of cooling as measured in-situ. After the ECM, the 
average combined tonnage produced increased to 67.78 tons. This 10% capacity increase from the baseline 
performance levels led to an effective average increase in COP of 9.9% and a calculated reduction in kWh of 
10.1%. All of these factors directly correlate to what Global Flavor/Fragrance Company will realize in energy savings as they operate 
this split system in the future as well as other HVAC equipment like Roof Top Units and Chillers under the 
similar parameters.
This 50-ton HVAC Equipment Manufacturer split system involved in the pilot supports the large 
blending and mixing room at the Global Flavor/Fragrance Company North American 
Headquarters and manufacturing facility located in Teterboro, NJ.

Following treatment the system also showed a 9.5% increase in the Enthalpy Delta across the coil versus 
the Baseline, which is a critical measurement used to determine the thermodynamic enhancement 
brought about by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result of the ECM improvement is an ROI to Global Flavor/Fragrance Company 
that is measured in a months. The tables of data used to determine the financial payback are available for 
review at the end of this report. 
  
Product Brief
         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure 
(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative® (NMR™) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, 
one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for at least 10 years in any type 
of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and equipment 
that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); chilled water 
systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia refrigeration 
plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The equipment 
utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single and 
multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® in any type of HVACR system are improved cooling 
performance, increased capacity and improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to 
achieve set point temperatures in a more rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The 
indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include 
reduced run time, less kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time 
and a reduced carbon footprint for Global Flavor/Fragrance Company.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) was utilized in the 
development of this report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating, 
Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization 
(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation 
methods and products.
There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They 
are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is 
defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM as the single source of 
measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM affected 
equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term 
measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by 
short-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations 
using measurements of proxies of energy use. 
The final computation follows the formula:

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces. 
A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the operational 
conditions of the system was satisfactory. Baseline M&V was recorded on the supporting compressor and 
then the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected. The gestation period for the Global Flavor/Fragrance Company 
pilot was 4 weeks. Prior to taking Post measurements, systems need to achieve 250-300 hours of runtime to 
ensure adequate performance improvement time. At the end of this gestation period, Post M&V results 
were taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same or very similar 
entering air wet bulb and dry bulb as well as compressor discharge pressures. These are three of the most 
critical variables to contend with in an in-situ HVAC testing situation. When analyzing all of the data 
baseline and post data, no adjustments for weather were necessary.
The following report produces the utilization of the International Performance Measurement and Verification 
Protocol (IPMVP) as the M&V plan. The Director of Facilities for Global Flavor/Fragrance Company, John DiGiacinto, and Sr. Facilities 
Technician, [Client Representative] Dam witnessed the collection of all the data used in this report. The final 
calculations were performed by Powertron Global®’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer].  
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
BTUH = CFM * 4.5 * Wet Bulb Enthalpy Delta
 
kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage
 
Percentage Eﬃciency = Measured BTUH / Manufacturers Design BTUH
 
Coeﬃcient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)

System Description / Design Characteristics
This system provides critical cooling for the Global Flavor/Fragrance Company manufacturing facility located 300 North Street, 
Teterboro, NJ.  Given the required internal load of the facility and weather BIN data, it is estimated that the 
system runs ~4,500 hours or more per year prior to the ECM being implemented.  
Baseline & Energy Reporting (Post) Periods
The identical IPMVP following data points were recorded for Baseline 
and Post on 8/6/13 and 9/4/13 respectively using recently NIST 
calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. The return wet and 
dry bulb temperatures entering the coil were very similar in both 
periods as were the discharge pressures of the compressor so no 
adjustments were made to the calculations. The measurements are as 
follows:

Results
The following are the final calculated average performance measurement improvements following the 
PermaFrost NMR® Post measurement period of the split system.  
PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for Global Flavor/Fragrance Company
Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Global Flavor/Fragrance Company for 
implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy savings 
resulting from the improvement in capacity. This greater capacity reduces the runtime hours and in turn reduces the annual 
kWh expended in the Post. The true ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the system was when operating at its 
original energy profile then subtracting the cost to operate the system at its newly restored energy profile less the percentage of 
increased capacity. This regression calculation is the most scientific method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the 
units will now run due to their increased capacity which allows the units to reach set temperatures quicker and shut off sooner. 
Baseline kWh        59.41 kW * 4,500 Annual Operating Hrs = 267,345 kWh
Cost to Run Baseline        267,345 kWh * $.128 = $34,220.16
Post ECM kWh        59.36 kW * 4,500 Annual Operating Hrs = 267,120 kWh
Revised kWh (based on 10% restored capacity)        267,120 kWh * (1 - .1) = 240,408 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Post        240,408 kWh * $.128 = $30,772.22
Avoided Energy Costs (Savings) Per Month        ($34,220.16 - $30,772.22) / 12 = $287.33
Cost of ECM        $6,250
ROI        $6,250 / $287.33 = 21.8 
 
  ROI = 22 months
