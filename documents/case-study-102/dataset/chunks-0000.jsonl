Following testing, the system was treated with the proper amount and type of the \nPermaFrost NMR® technology specially formulated for these types of systems.  Measurement and \nVerification (M&V) was conducted pre-installation and post-gestation. The purpose of the testing was to 1) \nshow how the ECM improves the thermal performance of any system it is installed in, and 2) show that the \nECM is safe and will not harm Global Flavor/Fragrance Company’s HVACR \nequipment.\nThe improvement in efficiency and restored \ncapacity gained directly at the unit was solely \nattributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. This \nis a result of the reversal of thermal inefficiency on heat \nexchange surfaces.  \nFollowing treatment with the ECM, the split \nsystem showed an effective net 9.1% reduction in \nkW/ton based on the exact capacity measured in \nthe baseline M&V and the post gestation M&V \nwhen operating at 100% load. The ECM also produced an average increase cooling capacity of 10% or 6.16 \ntons. Prior to the ECM, the system produced 61.62 tons of cooling as measured in-situ. After the ECM, the \naverage combined tonnage produced increased to 67.78 tons. This 10% capacity increase from the baseline \nperformance levels led to an effective average increase in COP of 9.9% and a calculated reduction in kWh of \n10.1%. All of these factors directly correlate to what Global Flavor/Fragrance Company will realize in energy savings as they operate \nthis split system in the future as well as other HVAC equipment like Roof Top Units and Chillers under the \nsimilar parameters.\nThis 50-ton HVAC Equipment Manufacturer split system involved in the pilot supports the large \nblending and mixing room at the Global Flavor/Fragrance Company North American \nHeadquarters and manufacturing facility located in Teterboro, NJ.   \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 709, "chars": 3242, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_100_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:ae90719218e8fd9d9cae61778bb38a134bbe78e996c1520c52741583584b913a"}

The result of the ECM improvement is an ROI to Global Flavor/Fragrance Company \nthat is measured in a months. The tables of data used to determine the financial payback are available for \nreview at the end of this report. \n  \nProduct Brief\n         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure \n(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative® (NMR™) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for at least 10 years in any type \nof system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and equipment \nthat PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); chilled water \nsystems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia refrigeration \nplants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The equipment \nutilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single and \nmulti-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® in any type of HVACR system are improved cooling \nperformance, increased capacity and improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to \nachieve set point temperatures in a more rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The \nindirect benefits resulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include \nreduced run time, less kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time \nand a reduced carbon footprint for Global Flavor/Fragrance Company.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 544, "chars": 2603, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_100_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_100_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:a1cb3d84067ff6055e809235f922c32a2fff15037d24c52e63963edd258683ef"}

Option B is \ndefined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM as the single source of \nmeasurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM affected \nequipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained.

Baseline M&V was recorded on the supporting compressor and \nthen the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected. The gestation period for the Global Flavor/Fragrance Company \npilot was 4 weeks. Prior to taking Post measurements, systems need to achieve 250-300 hours of runtime to \nensure adequate performance improvement time. At the end of this gestation period, Post M&V results \nwere taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same or very similar \nentering air wet bulb and dry bulb as well as compressor discharge pressures. These are three of the most \ncritical variables to contend with in an in-situ HVAC testing situation. When analyzing all of the data \nbaseline and post data, no adjustments for weather were necessary.\nThe following report produces the utilization of the International Performance Measurement and Verification \nProtocol (IPMVP) as the M&V plan. The Director of Facilities for Global Flavor/Fragrance Company, John DiGiacinto, and Sr. Facilities \nTechnician, [Client Representative] Dam witnessed the collection of all the data used in this report. The final \ncalculations were performed by Powertron Global®’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer].  \nThe results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:\n \nkW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) \n \nBTUH = CFM * 4.5 * Wet Bulb Enthalpy Delta\n \nkW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage\n \nPercentage Eﬃciency = Measured BTUH / Manufacturers Design BTUH\n \nCoeﬃcient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 569, "chars": 2554, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_100_chunk_0003", "next_id": "pdf_100_chunk_0005", "content_hash": "sha256:b4b69988cdedbb43ee108282c8f59dbd57494bc1a36d3b89285ea9db1b3ac126"}
