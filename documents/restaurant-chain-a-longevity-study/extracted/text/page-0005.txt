Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
RTU Unit Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Restaurant Chain A is experiencing significant thermal degradation in its HVAC/R units. The lower baseline 
operating tonnage and COP ratings are calculated based on historical data and are in line with the ASHRAE 
loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. The degraded equipment performance was costing Ruby 
Tuesday significant money and wasting energy in the four pilot RTU’s. The equipment was using significantly 
more kWh to operate than they did when they were new.
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the RTU’s in the baseline and post 
testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® 
ECM in the four RTU’s averaging 11 years of age resulted in a restoration of 10.42 operating tons and an 
average improvement of 31.6% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate 
the RTU’s throughout the year.
When compared to the newer untreated control RTU, the pilot RTU’s are already outperforming it. The 11 year 
old units are averaging 9.82 tons of cooling produced while the Control Unit has already slipped to 9.37 tons. 
This difference of .45 tons means the older units are producing an average of 4.8% more tonnage than the 
Control Unit and a corresponding improvement in COP of 6.35%.
