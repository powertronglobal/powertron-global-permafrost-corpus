The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for all four of the Restaurant Chain A RTU’s.
Baseline Energy Consumption without PermaFrost NMR®
Baseline Tonnage: 28.86 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: 1.50 kW/ton * 39.28 tons = 58.92 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 58.92 kW * 3,000 Annual Operating Hrs = 176,760 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 176,760 kWh * $.12 = $21,211
Post Energy Consumption with PermaFrost NMR®
kW Post: 1.13 kW/ton * 39.28 tons = 44.39 kW
Annual kWh Post: 44.39 kW * 3,000 hours = 133,170 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 133,170 kWh * .12 cents = $15,980
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $21,211 - $15,980 = $5,231
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $5,231 / 12 = $436
Return On Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in all four of the pilot RTU’s: $5,000
Estimated ROI Period for Pilot RTU’s: $5,000 / $436 = 12 months
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period 
for Restaurant Chain A for implementing the PermaFrost NMR®, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true 
energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended 
in the Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems was when operating at the 
original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the 
revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® was installed. This regression 
analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the systems will now operate 
due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the internal building set points with 
increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
