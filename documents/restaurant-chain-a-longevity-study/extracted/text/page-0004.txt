Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the pilot RTU’s to perform prior to and 
following the ECM being installed. The report will also illustrate the amount of thermal degradation that had 
occurred due in large part to oil migration within the heat exchangers and how much of that has been 
restored.
 
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• Tons = (Airflow * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta) / 12,000 
 
• KW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
 
• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Air Temp – Saturated Suction Temp 
Notes 
Following a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to determine the operational condition of the system was still 
satisfactory; two-year post ECM data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. The delta of these measurements and 
associated historical baseline performance calculations show the amount of capacity restored and amount of money saved.
The following IPMVP data points were recorded on 25 & 26 May 2014 using recently purchased devices calibrated in 
accordance with NIST (National Institutes of Standards and Technology) standards to insure measurement accuracy. 
The RTU’s were initially treated with the ECM in March 2012. The two years since then not only ensures the ECM had 
ample time to prove longevity of the thermal benefits. All measurements were taken at 100% load and at similar return 
air and outdoor air temperatures. 
The collection of the data in the post period was collected by Powertron Global® and visual evidence of all measurements 
used in the calculations in this report are available upon request. The detailed measurements are listed further below.
