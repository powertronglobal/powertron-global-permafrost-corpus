Recovered Wasted Energy with ECM -  RTU’s
The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration the ECM created in the treated RTU’s. The 
average cost to operate these RTU’s before they were 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, averaged 1.50.
The specific cost to operate these RTU’s after they 
were treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, is currently 1.13.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate for these 11 year old RTU’s. The post results are also in 
line with the average improvement savings shown in more than 120,000 installations globally.
