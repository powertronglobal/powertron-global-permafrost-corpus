HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Cost to Restaurant Chain A to Operate the RTU’s Baseline vs Post
The next chart illustrates how much money the efficiency performance loss of the pilot RTU’s was costing Ruby 
Tuesday in the way of wasted energy each and every day they were operating prior to the ECM. The average 
cost to operate these RTU’s as calculated in kW/ ton was 1.50 in the Baseline. When originally installed, the 
kW/ton rating for units like these usually ranges from 1.0 to 1.2 kW/ton. This means Restaurant Chain A was 
paying up to 26.7% more than design for energy to run the RTU’s as a direct result of the reduced level of 
performance. These kW/ton ratings are very much in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to 
operate numbers.
  
The restored average kW/ton rating following the ECM is now 1.13. This represents a 24.7% reduction in 
energy costs from the baseline for every ton of cooling produced. It also brings down the Restaurant Chain A costs to 
operate the RTU’s to just 1.8% off of design. This resulted in a payback period to Restaurant Chain A of 
approximately 12 months. Over just a few years these accumulated savings will greatly reduce the eventual 
CapEx costs to replace the RTU’s when they finally reach the end of their useful life.
