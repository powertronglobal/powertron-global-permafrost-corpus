HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report
Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study
The purpose of this study is to verify that the restored capacity produced two years ago when all four rooftop 
units (RTU’s) were first treated with the PermaFrost NMR® is being sustained.  This same efficiency 
improvement is then quantified into dollars saved by Restaurant Chain A in the treated RTU’s. 
The roof top units involved in this study are representative of a great majority of the portfolio of equipment 
operated by Restaurant Chain A. The same information gathered in the study is then extrapolated out across the 
entire Restaurant Chain A portfolio to closely estimate what capacity has already been lost in term of increased 
energy costs. This same extrapolation methodology is also used to estimate what the potential future avoided 
wasted energy costs are expected to be when treating all RTU’s, refrigeration and ice machines.  
Many industry leading organizations, including the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air 
Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), project that all heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration 
(HVACR) units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they operate and age. Thermal degradation is caused by a 
phenomenon that is present in all HVACR equipment that operates as a vapor compression cycle associated 
with refrigerant and oil for lubrication. This thermal degradation is well documented by the HVACR industry 
and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal degradation prevents units from operating at the 
original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times and additional kWh consumption.

Process
This report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of four similar RTU’s treated 
two years ago with PermaFrost NMR® compared to where ASHRAE degradation averages had them performing 
prior to treatment. A fifth similar RTU that was installed on the roof of one of the same four restaurants six 
months following initial equipment PermaFrost NMR® treatment (which was not treated) serves as a control unit 
and as another valuable way to demonstrate the value gained through the use of PermaFrost NMR®. 
Detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the pilot RTU’s unit after the 
installation of PermaFrost NMR® to determine the impact on the three key elements that greatly affect Ruby 
Tuesday’s power bill as they relate to the original design specifications: 
 
1.  The cooling capacity the RTU’s are capable of producing after an average of 11 years in service.
 
2.  The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the RTU’s are delivering as 
      
     reflected in the kW/ton measurement. 
 
3.  The thermal dynamic ability of the RTU’s to continue to perform at or close to operational design.
Methodology
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the 
IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted of 
Energy Consulting Partner's CEO, [CEO] and Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer].  The 
manager on duty at each of the locations signed off on all the measurements taken prior to the team leaving 
each location, preserving the integrity of the data.
Notes 
Since power bills for the four restaurants already show savings, the focus of the field M&V was on determining the current 
performance levels of the four pilot RTU’s. The RTU’s were also compared to historical performance characteristics of 
themselves two years earlier and to a newer similar RTU that was not treated with the ECM. This helps to closely estimate 
the amount of savings already achieved by Restaurant Chain A and helps determine the impact of future savings.  
The readings were taken in the same conditions used by Air-Conditioning, Heating, & Refrigeration Institute (AHRI) to 
issue capacity ratings. All RTU’s were tested in sunny conditions with outside air temperatures between 80-82 degrees. 
The boundary of the testing was the RTU’s and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance 
calculations is very high.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the pilot RTU’s to perform prior to and 
following the ECM being installed. The report will also illustrate the amount of thermal degradation that had 
occurred due in large part to oil migration within the heat exchangers and how much of that has been 
restored.
 
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• Tons = (Airflow * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta) / 12,000 
 
• KW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
 
• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Air Temp – Saturated Suction Temp 
Notes 
Following a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to determine the operational condition of the system was still 
satisfactory; two-year post ECM data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. The delta of these measurements and 
associated historical baseline performance calculations show the amount of capacity restored and amount of money saved.
The following IPMVP data points were recorded on 25 & 26 May 2014 using recently purchased devices calibrated in 
accordance with NIST (National Institutes of Standards and Technology) standards to insure measurement accuracy. 
The RTU’s were initially treated with the ECM in March 2012. The two years since then not only ensures the ECM had 
ample time to prove longevity of the thermal benefits. All measurements were taken at 100% load and at similar return 
air and outdoor air temperatures. 
The collection of the data in the post period was collected by Powertron Global® and visual evidence of all measurements 
used in the calculations in this report are available upon request. The detailed measurements are listed further below.

Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
RTU Unit Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Restaurant Chain A is experiencing significant thermal degradation in its HVAC/R units. The lower baseline 
operating tonnage and COP ratings are calculated based on historical data and are in line with the ASHRAE 
loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. The degraded equipment performance was costing Ruby 
Tuesday significant money and wasting energy in the four pilot RTU’s. The equipment was using significantly 
more kWh to operate than they did when they were new.
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the RTU’s in the baseline and post 
testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® 
ECM in the four RTU’s averaging 11 years of age resulted in a restoration of 10.42 operating tons and an 
average improvement of 31.6% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate 
the RTU’s throughout the year.
When compared to the newer untreated control RTU, the pilot RTU’s are already outperforming it. The 11 year 
old units are averaging 9.82 tons of cooling produced while the Control Unit has already slipped to 9.37 tons. 
This difference of .45 tons means the older units are producing an average of 4.8% more tonnage than the 
Control Unit and a corresponding improvement in COP of 6.35%.

Recovered Wasted Energy with ECM -  RTU’s
The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration the ECM created in the treated RTU’s. The 
average cost to operate these RTU’s before they were 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, averaged 1.50.
The specific cost to operate these RTU’s after they 
were treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, is currently 1.13.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate for these 11 year old RTU’s. The post results are also in 
line with the average improvement savings shown in more than 120,000 installations globally.

HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Calculated Eﬃciency of Restaurant Chain A RTU’s Baseline and Post
The chart below illustrates how far off design the Restaurant Chain A RTU’s had degraded in terms of efficiency 
over 11 years of the coils being in use. The RTU’s were performing at an average of 75.5% of the original design 
efficiency when they were first treated with PermaFrost NMR®. The nominal design rated tonnage of each of 
RTU’s is 10 tons. In actuality however, each of the RTU’s was only producing an average of 7.22 tons at the start 
of the pilot. The majority of this 24.5% efficiency loss was directly attributable to the thermal degradation of the 
heat exchange surfaces. This is due in large part to oil migration creating an insulating barrier to heat transfer 
through the tube walls. 
After the ECM was installed, the average efficiency in the RTU’s unit jumped up to 98.2% of design 
specifications or 9.82 tons each. This represents a 30% improvement in efficiency over the baseline numbers.

HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Cost to Restaurant Chain A to Operate the RTU’s Baseline vs Post
The next chart illustrates how much money the efficiency performance loss of the pilot RTU’s was costing Ruby 
Tuesday in the way of wasted energy each and every day they were operating prior to the ECM. The average 
cost to operate these RTU’s as calculated in kW/ ton was 1.50 in the Baseline. When originally installed, the 
kW/ton rating for units like these usually ranges from 1.0 to 1.2 kW/ton. This means Restaurant Chain A was 
paying up to 26.7% more than design for energy to run the RTU’s as a direct result of the reduced level of 
performance. These kW/ton ratings are very much in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to 
operate numbers.
  
The restored average kW/ton rating following the ECM is now 1.13. This represents a 24.7% reduction in 
energy costs from the baseline for every ton of cooling produced. It also brings down the Restaurant Chain A costs to 
operate the RTU’s to just 1.8% off of design. This resulted in a payback period to Restaurant Chain A of 
approximately 12 months. Over just a few years these accumulated savings will greatly reduce the eventual 
CapEx costs to replace the RTU’s when they finally reach the end of their useful life.

Return On Investment
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for all four of the Restaurant Chain A RTU’s.
Baseline Energy Consumption without PermaFrost NMR®
Baseline Tonnage: 28.86 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: 1.50 kW/ton * 39.28 tons = 58.92 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 58.92 kW * 3,000 Annual Operating Hrs = 176,760 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 176,760 kWh * $.12 = $21,211
Post Energy Consumption with PermaFrost NMR®
kW Post: 1.13 kW/ton * 39.28 tons = 44.39 kW
Annual kWh Post: 44.39 kW * 3,000 hours = 133,170 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 133,170 kWh * .12 cents = $15,980
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $21,211 - $15,980 = $5,231
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $5,231 / 12 = $436
Return On Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in all four of the pilot RTU’s: $5,000
Estimated ROI Period for Pilot RTU’s: $5,000 / $436 = 12 months
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period 
for Restaurant Chain A for implementing the PermaFrost NMR®, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true 
energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended 
in the Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems was when operating at the 
original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the 
revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® was installed. This regression 
analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the systems will now operate 
due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the internal building set points with 
increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.

Financial Impact of PermaFrost NMR® to Restaurant Chain A
Cost to Restaurant Chain A to Operate the RTU’s Baseline vs Post
The next chart illustrates the capacity loss in the four pilot RTU's on multiple locations. These units cost 
Restaurant Chain As significant wasted energy in the past 11 years at an estimated $33,592. Left untreated these 
units waste an additional $47,161 or 393,012 kWh.
Kilowatt Hours (kWh) Loss / Gain With / Without PermaFrost NMR® Treatment
Savings indicated inside red circle equates to a 12 Month Project Payback for Restaurant Chain A when treating 
the four (4) RTU’s in the mid-Atlantic region. This is determined by dividing the $5,000 cost of treating the 4 
RTU’s with PermaFrost NMR® by the anticipated annual savings of $4,938 and then multiplying the result 
by 12 months.
Savings indicated inside orange circle equates to an overall ROI for Restaurant Chain A of 943% over the 
remaining 9 years of projected useful equipment life in the mid-Atlantic region. This is determined by 
dividing the projected savings of $47,161 by the $5,000 cost of treating the 4 RTU’s with PermaFrost NMR® 
and then multiplying the result by 100.

Cost to Restaurant Chain A to Operate the Control RTU
The next chart illustrates how much the efficiency performance loss the pilot control RTU is already costing 
Restaurant Chain A in wasted energy over the first 18 months it has been in service and what the projected 
savings will be over its remaining useful life. If Restaurant Chain A chooses not to treat the unit, these future 
avoided costs will hit operational costs instead of dropping to the bottom line.
Kilowatt Hours (kWh) Loss/Gain With/Without PermaFrost NMR® Treatment
Savings indicated inside red circle equates to a 36-37 Month Project Payback for Restaurant Chain A when 
treating a new RTU in the mid-Atlantic region. This is determined by dividing the full turn-key rollout cost 
of $1,100 for treating the RTU with PermaFrost NMR® by the anticipated third year cumulative savings of 
$1,085 and then multiplying the result by 36 months. In just over a year in service, the newer control unit has 
already cost Restaurant Chain A $106 in lost energy that can never be recovered.
Savings indicated inside orange circle equates to an overall ROI for Restaurant Chain A of 1,486% over the 
remaining 19 years of projected useful equipment life in the mid-Atlantic region. This is determined by 
dividing the projected 19 years avoided cost savings of $16,343 by the $1,100 cost of treating the newer RTU 
with PermaFrost NMR® and then multiplying the result by 100.

Estimated Savings to Restaurant Chain A for Treating Entire Portfolio
The next chart illustrates the substantial savings potential Restaurant Chain A will realize by moving forward this summer 
with treating their entire portfolio of HVACR equipment. The following assumptions were used in the calculations:
 
• 10 year average age of HVACR equipment; 
 
• 40 tons of HVACR per location; 
 
• Equipment runtime of 3,400 hours each; 
 
• Average cost of $.12 per kWh delivered across all 700 restaurants
Kilowatt Hours (kWh) Loss / Gain With / Without PermaFrost NMR® Treatment
Savings indicated inside red circle equates to a 12 Month Project Payback for Restaurant Chain A when treating all 700 
locations across the US. This is determined by dividing the $2,940,000 cost of treating the HVACR equipment with 
PermaFrost NMR® by the anticipated annual savings of $3,091,334 and then multiplying the result by 12 months. 
Savings indicated inside orange circle equates to an overall ROI for Restaurant Chain A of 1,142% over the remaining 10 
years of projected useful equipment life across the total portfolio. This is determined by dividing the projected 10 
years of avoided cost savings of $33,577,421 by the $2,940,000 cost of treating the entire portfolio with PermaFrost 
NMR® and then multiplying the result by 100. If Restaurant Chain A is operating at a net profit margin of 5%, the estimated 
10 year savings of $33,577,421 is EQUIVALENT to $671,548,420 in food/beverage sales revenue that Restaurant Chain A 
DOES NOT have to generate to maintain current performance levels.

Notes
The pilot RTU’s provide cooling to the Kitchens 
in three of the four locations. The RTU at Philly 
Airport provides cooling to the Middle part of 
the restaurant. Given the usage of the facility 
and the weather in the mid-Atlantic region, it is 
estimated the RTU’s run approximately 3,000 
hours annually prior to PermaFrost NMR® 
installation.

Restaurant Chain A is Saving More than Just Energy
By treating just the four pilot RTU’s with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the current manner Restaurant Chain A 
operates them, it will save approximately 43,590 kWh per year and all the costs and goodwill associated with 
those savings. When treating all their HVACR systems, Restaurant Chain A will save an estimated 18,732,000 
kWh. From an environmental impact standpoint, Restaurant Chain A is also benefitting the surrounding 
communities in which they operate. 
The estimated 18,732,000 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 12,917 metric tons of greenhouse gas 
emissions from being released or any of the following:
