Study Summary
The +20% improved efficiency (COP) measured four years ago has sustained and is still present in the 
PermaFrost NMR® treated unit. Compared to the untreated units, it is still operating approximately 24.6% 
more efficiently four years later. If all of the units in the building (7000 tons) were treated at the time of the 
initial pilot the site would have saved $4,326,000 in energy costs on an initial investment of $875,000. This equates 
to a four year ROI of 595%.  
Study Overview
This report details the results of the recently completed comprehensive four-year energy performance study 
conducted at the Commercial Real Estate Developer Commercial Tower A Building in New York, NY.  The study ran from August 2011 
to August 2015.
The pilot was designed to illustrate the positive impact the PermaFrost NMR® energy control measure (ECM) 
would have in both the short term and long term on the overall cooling performance of a nominal 32-ton package 
unit. The improvements for this or any field test resulting from PermaFrost NMR® are dependent on factors such 
as age, condition, service history, design and application of each unit. In this particular analysis the results were 
in line with 13 year historical averages. The 53rd floor pilot unit and the identical untreated control unit on the 
32nd floor support similar sized east side elevator motor rooms and both were put into full service in 2006. 
Highlights of the study when comparing the pilot unit to itself before and 30 days and four 
years after treatment include the following:
• When initially tested in 2011 after just five years in service, the pilot unit was producing 27.7 tons of 
cooling capacity. Thirty days after treatment, the cooling capacity jumped 18.8% to 32.9 tons. Four years 
after initial treatment, the pilot unit is sustaining a cooling capacity of 32.5 tons.
• When the efficiency improvements were measured on the treated system four year ago, the initial 
payback was estimated to be less than 12 months. The current efficiency of the system shows that 
Commercial Real Estate Developer realized the initial payback in 11.9 months. 
• The annual cost to operate the pilot unit was estimated to be $25,396 before initial treatment with 
PermaFrost NMR®. Four years later, the cost to run the unit is $21,341 per year illustrating the 
sustainability of the PermaFrost NMR® technology.

Highlights of the study when comparing the treated pilot unit to an identical untreated control 
unit after nine years in service include the following:
• The cooling capacity of the treated unit is 32.5 tons or 22.6% higher than the 26.5 ton cooling capacity 
of the untreated control unit.
• The efficiency of the treated unit in terms of kW/ton is 19.7% better than the untreated control unit 
and the Coefficient of Performance (COP) is 24.6% better.
• The estimated annual cost to operate the treated unit is currently $21,341, while the untreated unit 
costs $26,582 annually to operate. In the past four years the untreated unit has cost Commercial Real Estate Developer $20,964 
more in energy to operate or $655 more per ton.  
• Extrapolated out across the 7,000 tons of cooling in Commercial Tower A, if all the units in the building were treated 
at the time of the initial pilot Commercial Real Estate Developer would have saved its tenants $4,326,000 in energy costs on an 
initial investment of $875,000. This equates to a four year ROI of 595%.  
The package cooling units involved in the study are recorded as follows:
    
Mammoth, Mfg date: 2006, R22, 408 volt-3 Phase, Model DS105ASMOEI5OIA   (Treated) 
    
Mammoth, Mfg date: 2006, R22, 408 volt-3 Phase, Model DS105ASMOEI5OIA   (Untreated)
 
Objectives
The five key objectives for this jointly-conducted ECM pilot study between Commercial Real Estate Developer Building Engineers, 
HVAC Contractor A Mechanical Engineers and the Powertron Global Engineering team were all achieved. They 
included the following: 
1. Determine that the “as-is” capacity and efficiency of the pilot Mammoth unit supporting the east side 
elevator motor room had degraded in 2011 by at least 10% after five years in operation.  
2. Demonstrate that a minimum of 10% performance improvement occurred in the pilot cooling unit 
one month after being treated with the PermaFrost NMR® ECM in 2011.

3. Demonstrate the sustainability of the ECM by showing 90% or more of the material performance 
improvements generated in 2011, just one month after being treated with PermaFrost NMR®, still 
remained in this same cooling unit four years later. 
4. After nine years in service, demonstrate the effectiveness and sustainability of the ECM by increasing 
the “as-is” efficiency and capacity of the treated pilot unit by more than 10% when compared to an 
identical untreated control unit performing the same function on another floor. 
5. To support an effective business case for further deployments of the ECM within the Commercial Real Estate Developer 
portfolio of properties, demonstrate financial benefits associated with efficiency improvements realized 
over the duration of the study. These benefits must be equivalent to a 24-month or less payback to 
Commercial Real Estate Developer on their initial pilot project costs.  
ECM Product Brief
PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented surface science nanotechnology that uses Nucleo Molecular 
Regenerative (NMR®) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, one-time treatment with no down time 
required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type of climate control system in which it is 
installed. The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling efficiency and increased capacity, both 
of which result in lower overall costs to operate a system and extended equipment life.
Methodology
After verifying the amount of air flowing across the evaporator coil before beginning the pilot, the subsequent 
measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with Option B of 
the IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. 
The results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic 
engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• kW/ton = Actual Measured Energy / Actual Measured Capacity 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = 12 / (kW/ton) /3.412
 
• Actual Cooling Capacity per Hour = (Measured CFM * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta T) / 12,000 BTU

Recovered Wasted Energy with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
As expected, Commercial Real Estate Developer has the problem of thermal degradation in their HVAC units. The degraded 
equipment performance is costing Commercial Real Estate Developer and their tenants significant operational dollars through 
wasted energy. When initially tested in 2011 before being treated, the pilot cooling unit was found to already 
be using significantly more energy to operate after just five years in service than when it was new. The same 
thing is true for the untreated control cooling unit after nine years in service.
The chart to the lower left illustrates the efficiency restoration the ECM has sustained in the pilot unit versus 
itself four years after treatment. The chart to the lower right illustrates the efficiency restoration the ECM 
has produced in the 9-year old pilot unit treated in 2011 versus a very similar control unit that has yet to be 
treated. What stands out is the initial PermaFrost NMR® efficiency improvements have proved to be 
sustainable over a long period of time while the untreated control unit has continued to degrade in 
performance. This degradation in operational efficiency is costing Commercial Real Estate Developer and their tenants a substantial 
amount of money in wasted energy. As the second chart clearly illustrates, the treated pilot unit is currently 
performing 24.6% more efficiently than the untreated control unit. This gap will only continue to widen 
until it levels off at 30-35% loss of efficiency.

Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the final calculated performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® Post 
measurement period for the pilot treated unit compared to the untreated control unit.
Untreated Unit Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Capacity:  26.5 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline:  1.42 * 32.5 tons = 46.15 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh:  46.15 * 3,600 Annual Operating Hrs = 166,140 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 166,140 kWh * $.16 = $26,582
Treated Unit Energy Consumption
kW Post:  1.14 * 32.5 tons = 37.05 kW
Annual kWh Post:  37.05 * 3,600 hours = 133,380 kWh
Annual Cost Post:  133,380 kWh * $.16 cents = $21,341
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year:  $26,582 - $21,341 = $5,241
Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $5,241 / 12 = $437
Return on Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in each nominal 32 ton capacity cooling units: $4,000
Estimated ROI Period for Commercial Real Estate Developer on each cooling unit: $4,000 / $437 = ~9.2 Months
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 131%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 655%
Energy Saved Each Year Once all Mammoth Units in Commercial Tower A Totaling 7,000 tons of Cooling are Treated = $1.146M
Utilizing data collected during the pilot study, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for 
Commercial Real Estate Developer for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true 
energy savings resulting from the improvement in both capacity and efficiency. Working together, these improvements 
reduce the annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the 
cooling unit was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available capacity 
and then subtracting the revised cost to run the cooling unit at the same restored capacity after the PermaFrostNMR® 
ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of 
hours and/or load % at which the unit will now operate due to the restored performance profile. This restored performance 
profile allows the cooling unit to satisfy the internal area set point with increased efficiency resulting in reduced 
compressor demand loading.

Commercial Real Estate Developer is Saving More than Just Energy
By treating just the pilot cooling unit with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the manner in which the pilot unit is 
currently being operated, based on the manner in which the treated pilot unit is now currently performing, 
Commercial Real Estate Developer has saved over the past four years an estimated 131,040 kWh and all the costs associated with 
those savings. From an environmental impact standpoint, Commercial Real Estate Developer has and will continue to benefit all the 
surrounding communities in which they operate.  Imagine the positive environmental impacts of treating the 
rest of Commercial Tower A and even the entire Commercial Real Estate Developer portfolio of equipment spread across the northeast.  
The 131,040 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 90.4 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from 
being released or any of the following:
