Compared to the untreated units, it is still operating approximately 24.6% \nmore efficiently four years later. If all of the units in the building (7000 tons) were treated at the time of the \ninitial pilot the site would have saved $4,326,000 in energy costs on an initial investment of $875,000. This equates \nto a four year ROI of 595%.  \nStudy Overview\nThis report details the results of the recently completed comprehensive four-year energy performance study \nconducted at the Commercial Real Estate Developer Commercial Tower A Building in New York, NY.  The study ran from August 2011 \nto August 2015.\nThe pilot was designed to illustrate the positive impact the PermaFrost NMR® energy control measure (ECM) \nwould have in both the short term and long term on the overall cooling performance of a nominal 32-ton package \nunit. The improvements for this or any field test resulting from PermaFrost NMR® are dependent on factors such \nas age, condition, service history, design and application of each unit. In this particular analysis the results were \nin line with 13 year historical averages. The 53rd floor pilot unit and the identical untreated control unit on the \n32nd floor support similar sized east side elevator motor rooms and both were put into full service in 2006. \nHighlights of the study when comparing the pilot unit to itself before and 30 days and four \nyears after treatment include the following:\n• When initially tested in 2011 after just five years in service, the pilot unit was producing 27.7 tons of \ncooling capacity. Thirty days after treatment, the cooling capacity jumped 18.8% to 32.9 tons. Four years \nafter initial treatment, the pilot unit is sustaining a cooling capacity of 32.5 tons.\n• When the efficiency improvements were measured on the treated system four year ago, the initial \npayback was estimated to be less than 12 months. The current efficiency of the system shows that \nCommercial Real Estate Developer realized the initial payback in 11.9 months. \n• The annual cost to operate the pilot unit was estimated to be $25,396 before initial treatment with \nPermaFrost NMR®. Four years later, the cost to run the unit is $21,341 per year illustrating the \nsustainability of the PermaFrost NMR® technology. \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website.", "tokens": 797, "chars": 3570, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_115_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:3938f8cf744ee4083abf67e8f75d8d349da2f48362108c161ab17fcc021ae87b"}

A sustainable, one-time treatment with no down time \nrequired, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type of climate control system in which it is \ninstalled. The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling efficiency and increased capacity, both \nof which result in lower overall costs to operate a system and extended equipment life.\nMethodology\nAfter verifying the amount of air flowing across the evaporator coil before beginning the pilot, the subsequent \nmeasurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with Option B of \nthe IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. \nThe results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic \nengineering formulas:\n \n• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) \n \n• kW/ton = Actual Measured Energy / Actual Measured Capacity \n \n• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = 12 / (kW/ton) /3.412\n \n• Actual Cooling Capacity per Hour = (Measured CFM * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta T) / 12,000 BTU\n \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 604, "chars": 2791, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_115_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_115_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:b5321e851f5d97200dfe9c923414ace45367dabaacfff066efbaad64a73a475c"}

The degraded \nequipment performance is costing Commercial Real Estate Developer and their tenants significant operational dollars through \nwasted energy. When initially tested in 2011 before being treated, the pilot cooling unit was found to already \nbe using significantly more energy to operate after just five years in service than when it was new. The same \nthing is true for the untreated control cooling unit after nine years in service.\nThe chart to the lower left illustrates the efficiency restoration the ECM has sustained in the pilot unit versus \nitself four years after treatment. The chart to the lower right illustrates the efficiency restoration the ECM \nhas produced in the 9-year old pilot unit treated in 2011 versus a very similar control unit that has yet to be \ntreated. What stands out is the initial PermaFrost NMR® efficiency improvements have proved to be \nsustainable over a long period of time while the untreated control unit has continued to degrade in \nperformance. This degradation in operational efficiency is costing Commercial Real Estate Developer and their tenants a substantial \namount of money in wasted energy. As the second chart clearly illustrates, the treated pilot unit is currently \nperforming 24.6% more efficiently than the untreated control unit. This gap will only continue to widen \nuntil it levels off at 30-35% loss of efficiency.\nIncreased Energy\nEquating to 19.7%\nIncreased Energy\nConsumption\nkW/ton\n.28 kW/ton\n.20 kW/ton\nSustained Energy\nReduction\n14.9% Sustained\nEnergy Reduction\nTreated Pilot Unit Performance Eﬃciency\n4 Years after Treatment\nBaseline\nPost ECM\n0.0\n0.3\n0.6\n0.9\n1.2\n1.5\n2011 Initial Baseline\n2015 4-Year Post\nkW/ton\nUntreated 9-Year Old Control Unit\nPerformance Eﬃciency vs. Treated Unit\nPerformance Eﬃciency\nBaseline\nPost ECM\n2015 Control Unit\n2015 Pilot Unit\n1.42\n1.14\n1.34\n1.14\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 630, "chars": 2650, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_115_chunk_0003", "next_id": "pdf_115_chunk_0005", "content_hash": "sha256:cbe999dcc452460bc87f9cad8b308c9487b447ca3c94ac499ac97b89e48906c3"}

Working together, these improvements \nreduce the annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the \ncooling unit was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available capacity \nand then subtracting the revised cost to run the cooling unit at the same restored capacity after the PermaFrostNMR® \nECM was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of \nhours and/or load % at which the unit will now operate due to the restored performance profile. This restored performance \nprofile allows the cooling unit to satisfy the internal area set point with increased efficiency resulting in reduced \ncompressor demand loading.\n7\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\n®\n19\nPassenger vehicles\n4.6\nGarbage trucks of waste sent to\nthe landﬁll instead of recycled\n10,168\nGallons of gasoline\nconsumed\n97,056\nPounds of coal burned\nannually\n210\nBarrels of oil\nconsumed\n12.4\nHomes’ electricity use for\none year\n8\nCommercial Real Estate Developer is Saving More than Just Energy\nBy treating just the pilot cooling unit with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the manner in which the pilot unit is \ncurrently being operated, based on the manner in which the treated pilot unit is now currently performing, \nCommercial Real Estate Developer has saved over the past four years an estimated 131,040 kWh and all the costs associated with \nthose savings.
