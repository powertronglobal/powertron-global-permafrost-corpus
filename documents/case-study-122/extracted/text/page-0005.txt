Recovered Wasted Energy with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
As expected, Commercial Real Estate Developer has the problem of thermal degradation in their HVAC units. The degraded 
equipment performance is costing Commercial Real Estate Developer and their tenants significant operational dollars through 
wasted energy. When initially tested in 2011 before being treated, the pilot cooling unit was found to already 
be using significantly more energy to operate after just five years in service than when it was new. The same 
thing is true for the untreated control cooling unit after nine years in service.
The chart to the lower left illustrates the efficiency restoration the ECM has sustained in the pilot unit versus 
itself four years after treatment. The chart to the lower right illustrates the efficiency restoration the ECM 
has produced in the 9-year old pilot unit treated in 2011 versus a very similar control unit that has yet to be 
treated. What stands out is the initial PermaFrost NMR® efficiency improvements have proved to be 
sustainable over a long period of time while the untreated control unit has continued to degrade in 
performance. This degradation in operational efficiency is costing Commercial Real Estate Developer and their tenants a substantial 
amount of money in wasted energy. As the second chart clearly illustrates, the treated pilot unit is currently 
performing 24.6% more efficiently than the untreated control unit. This gap will only continue to widen 
until it levels off at 30-35% loss of efficiency.
