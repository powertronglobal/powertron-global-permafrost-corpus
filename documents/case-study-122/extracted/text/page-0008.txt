Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the final calculated performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® Post 
measurement period for the pilot treated unit compared to the untreated control unit.
Untreated Unit Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Capacity:  26.5 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline:  1.42 * 32.5 tons = 46.15 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh:  46.15 * 3,600 Annual Operating Hrs = 166,140 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 166,140 kWh * $.16 = $26,582
Treated Unit Energy Consumption
kW Post:  1.14 * 32.5 tons = 37.05 kW
Annual kWh Post:  37.05 * 3,600 hours = 133,380 kWh
Annual Cost Post:  133,380 kWh * $.16 cents = $21,341
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year:  $26,582 - $21,341 = $5,241
Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $5,241 / 12 = $437
Return on Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in each nominal 32 ton capacity cooling units: $4,000
Estimated ROI Period for Commercial Real Estate Developer on each cooling unit: $4,000 / $437 = ~9.2 Months
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 131%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 655%
Energy Saved Each Year Once all Mammoth Units in Commercial Tower A Totaling 7,000 tons of Cooling are Treated = $1.146M
Utilizing data collected during the pilot study, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for 
Commercial Real Estate Developer for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true 
energy savings resulting from the improvement in both capacity and efficiency. Working together, these improvements 
reduce the annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the 
cooling unit was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available capacity 
and then subtracting the revised cost to run the cooling unit at the same restored capacity after the PermaFrostNMR® 
ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of 
hours and/or load % at which the unit will now operate due to the restored performance profile. This restored performance 
profile allows the cooling unit to satisfy the internal area set point with increased efficiency resulting in reduced 
compressor demand loading.
