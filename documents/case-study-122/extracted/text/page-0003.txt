Highlights of the study when comparing the treated pilot unit to an identical untreated control 
unit after nine years in service include the following:
• The cooling capacity of the treated unit is 32.5 tons or 22.6% higher than the 26.5 ton cooling capacity 
of the untreated control unit.
• The efficiency of the treated unit in terms of kW/ton is 19.7% better than the untreated control unit 
and the Coefficient of Performance (COP) is 24.6% better.
• The estimated annual cost to operate the treated unit is currently $21,341, while the untreated unit 
costs $26,582 annually to operate. In the past four years the untreated unit has cost Commercial Real Estate Developer $20,964 
more in energy to operate or $655 more per ton.  
• Extrapolated out across the 7,000 tons of cooling in Commercial Tower A, if all the units in the building were treated 
at the time of the initial pilot Commercial Real Estate Developer would have saved its tenants $4,326,000 in energy costs on an 
initial investment of $875,000. This equates to a four year ROI of 595%.  
The package cooling units involved in the study are recorded as follows:
    
Mammoth, Mfg date: 2006, R22, 408 volt-3 Phase, Model DS105ASMOEI5OIA   (Treated) 
    
Mammoth, Mfg date: 2006, R22, 408 volt-3 Phase, Model DS105ASMOEI5OIA   (Untreated)
 
Objectives
The five key objectives for this jointly-conducted ECM pilot study between Commercial Real Estate Developer Building Engineers, 
HVAC Contractor A Mechanical Engineers and the Powertron Global Engineering team were all achieved. They 
included the following: 
1. Determine that the “as-is” capacity and efficiency of the pilot Mammoth unit supporting the east side 
elevator motor room had degraded in 2011 by at least 10% after five years in operation.  
2. Demonstrate that a minimum of 10% performance improvement occurred in the pilot cooling unit 
one month after being treated with the PermaFrost NMR® ECM in 2011.
