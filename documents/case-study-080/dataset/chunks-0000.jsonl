The units (#2, #3 and #6) are all the \nsame age but are various sizes that each support different parts of the Major Craft Retailer Beltline Road store in [Texas Location], \nTX. Detailed forensic performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the same three \nRTU’s using R22 as the refrigerant. Following testing, each RTU was treated with the proper amount and \ntype of the PermaFrost NMR® technology specially formulated for these types of systems.\nMeasurement and Verification (M&V) was \nconducted pre-installation and post-gestation.\nThe purpose of the testing was threefold:  \n      Demonstrate how the ECM improves the thermal \n      performance. \n      Demonstrate ECM is safe and will not harm \n      Michael’s HVAC equipment.\n      Calculate the amount of energy saved per unit by \n      restoring lost eﬃciency.\nThe improvement in efficiency and restored capacity \ngained directly at each RTU was solely attributable \nto the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. This is a result of \nthe successful removal of the accumulated lubricant \nexcess layer on heat exchange surfaces.\nFollowing treatment with the ECM, RTU’s #2, #3 and #4 showed a reduction in kW/ton of 24.6%, 28.1%, and \n15% respectively based on the exact capacity measured in the baseline M&V and the post gestation M&V \nwhen operating at 100% load.   \nThis 15-ton Lennox package RTU was one of three units involved \nin the pilot. These units help cool the Major Craft Retailer Beltline Road Store \nin [Texas Location].  The image shows several of the NIST-calibrated \nand certified digital instrumentation used to calculate the \nefficiency of each of the three RTU’s in both the Baseline and \nAvoided Energy Reporting Period or Post.\n1\n2\n3\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 662, "chars": 2881, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_080_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:568835e2e43c35cb4ec77ed66940e38dd4e912e327db4434fa001e6917e91498"}

Prior to the ECM, the three RTU’s \nproduced a total of 27.93 tons of cooling as measured in-situ. After the ECM, the average combined \ntonnage produced increased to 34.47 tons. This 23.4% cooling capacity increase from the baseline \nperformance levels led to an effective average increase in COP across the RTU’s of 29.9% and a calculated \nreduction in kWh of 52,464 or 24.55%. All of these factors directly correlate to what Major Craft Retailer will realize \nin energy savings as they operate these RTU’s in the future as well as other similar HVAC equipment \nacross their portfolio.  \nFollowing treatment, the three RTU’s also showed a combined 19.4% increase in the Enthalpy Delta \nacross the coil versus the Baseline and a combined 23.6% reduction in refrigerant approach. Both of these \nare critical measurements used to determine the thermodynamic enhancement brought about by the \nPermaFrost NMR® ECM.

A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for at least 10 years in any \ntype of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and \nequipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); \nchilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia \nrefrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The \nequipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single \nand multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® in any type of HVACR system are improved cooling \nperformance, increased capacity and improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to \nachieve set point temperatures in a more rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. \nThe indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment \ninclude reduced run time, less kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life \ncycle time and a reduced carbon footprint for Major Craft Retailer.\nEnergy Science Division\nBOUNDARY LAYER\nOIL REMOVED\nBEFORE TREATMENT\nAFTER TREATMENT\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 436, "chars": 2052, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_080_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_080_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:bf12bafec6f01aab905a488cfa1f57114a27568dfe7cd69a11fa313ae5e0401c"}

For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained.

Then the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® \nwas injected directly into the low pressure service port of the refrigerant \nloop. The gestation period for the Major Craft Retailer pilot was four weeks.\nPrior to taking AERP measurements, systems need to achieve at least \n300 or more hours of runtime to ensure adequate performance \nimprovement time. At the end of this gestation period, AERP \nmeasurements were taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, \ntaking special care to match the same discharge pressures on the \ncompressors as well as the wet bulb and dry bulb temperatures of the \nair entering the respective coils. These are three of the most critical \nvariables to contend with in an in-situ HVAC testing situation.

The true ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the system \nwas when operating at its original energy profile then subtracting the cost to operate the system at its newly restored \nenergy profile less the percentage of increased capacity. This regression calculation is the most scientific method of \naccounting for the reduced number of hours the units will now run due to their increased capacity which allows the \nunits to reach set temperatures quicker and shut off sooner. \nSince this regression analysis involves three units, the average kW/ton and total tons are used to calculate an average \nROI across the three units.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 631, "chars": 2336, "pages": {"start": 9, "end": 10}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_080_chunk_0007", "next_id": "pdf_080_chunk_0009", "content_hash": "sha256:d78114ba6a1834051e7acf2a348293084f08a98034c4b3fda6e635137ade922a"}
