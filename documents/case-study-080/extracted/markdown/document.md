PermaFrost NMR® Eﬃciency Report
Major Craft Retailer Arts & Crafts Stores - [Texas Location] Beltline Rd Location

November, 2013

Report Summary

This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy conservation measure

(ECM) PermaFrost NMR® into three (3) package roof top units (RTU’s). The units (#2, #3 and #6) are all the

same age but are various sizes that each support different parts of the Major Craft Retailer Beltline Road store in [Texas Location],

TX. Detailed forensic performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the same three

RTU’s using R22 as the refrigerant. Following testing, each RTU was treated with the proper amount and

type of the PermaFrost NMR® technology specially formulated for these types of systems.

Measurement and Verification (M&V) was

conducted pre-installation and post-gestation.

The purpose of the testing was threefold:

Demonstrate how the ECM improves the thermal

performance.

Demonstrate ECM is safe and will not harm

Michael’s HVAC equipment.

Calculate the amount of energy saved per unit by

restoring lost eﬃciency.

The improvement in efficiency and restored capacity

gained directly at each RTU was solely attributable

to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. This is a result of

the successful removal of the accumulated lubricant

excess layer on heat exchange surfaces.

Following treatment with the ECM, RTU’s #2, #3 and #4 showed a reduction in kW/ton of 24.6%, 28.1%, and

15% respectively based on the exact capacity measured in the baseline M&V and the post gestation M&V

when operating at 100% load.

This 15-ton Lennox package RTU was one of three units involved

in the pilot. These units help cool the Major Craft Retailer Beltline Road Store

in [Texas Location].  The image shows several of the NIST-calibrated

and certified digital instrumentation used to calculate the

efficiency of each of the three RTU’s in both the Baseline and

Avoided Energy Reporting Period or Post.

The ECM also produced an increase cooling capacity of 26.8%, 25%, and 10.7% respectively equating to a

total increase of 6.29 tons or an average of 2.096 tons per RTU. Prior to the ECM, the three RTU’s

produced a total of 27.93 tons of cooling as measured in-situ. After the ECM, the average combined

tonnage produced increased to 34.47 tons. This 23.4% cooling capacity increase from the baseline

performance levels led to an effective average increase in COP across the RTU’s of 29.9% and a calculated

reduction in kWh of 52,464 or 24.55%. All of these factors directly correlate to what Major Craft Retailer will realize

in energy savings as they operate these RTU’s in the future as well as other similar HVAC equipment

across their portfolio.

Following treatment, the three RTU’s also showed a combined 19.4% increase in the Enthalpy Delta

across the coil versus the Baseline and a combined 23.6% reduction in refrigerant approach. Both of these

are critical measurements used to determine the thermodynamic enhancement brought about by the

PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result of the ECM improvements is an ROI to Major Craft Retailer that is measured in

months. The tables of data used to determine the financial payback are available for review at the end of

this report.

Product Brief

PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure

(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative® (NMR™) technology as its core agent. A sustainable,

one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for at least 10 years in any

type of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and

equipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX);

chilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia

refrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The

equipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single

and multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.

The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® in any type of HVACR system are improved cooling

performance, increased capacity and improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to

achieve set point temperatures in a more rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods.

The indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment

include reduced run time, less kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life

cycle time and a reduced carbon footprint for Major Craft Retailer.

Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy

+/ - Routine adjustments  + /- Non-Routine Adjustments

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol

The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) was utilized in the

development of this report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating,

Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization

(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation

measures and products.

There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They

are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is

defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM as the single source of

measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM affected

equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.

Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the

savings and the length of the reporting period. For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term

measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by

short-term measurements of baseline and avoided energy reporting period (AERP), and /or engineering

computations using measurements of proxies of energy use.

The final computation follows the formula:

(ECM) Content

The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to remove the

accumulated lubricant excess layer on the heat exchange surfaces.

A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to

determine if the operational conditions of the systems were satisfactory.

Baseline M&V was recorded on each of the three RTU’s and six

compressors. Then the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR®

was injected directly into the low pressure service port of the refrigerant

loop. The gestation period for the Major Craft Retailer pilot was four weeks.

Prior to taking AERP measurements, systems need to achieve at least

300 or more hours of runtime to ensure adequate performance

improvement time. At the end of this gestation period, AERP

measurements were taken in the identical manner as in the baseline,

taking special care to match the same discharge pressures on the

compressors as well as the wet bulb and dry bulb temperatures of the

air entering the respective coils. These are three of the most critical

variables to contend with in an in-situ HVAC testing situation. When

analyzing all of the data in the baseline and AERP, no adjustments to

the data were needed.

The following report produces the utilization of the International Performance Measurement and

Verification Protocol (IPMVP) as the M&V plan. [Contractor President], President of LVR Mechanical and Kerry

Burr, Operation Manager for LVR Mechanical along with their technicians, collected all of the readings.

LVR is the mechanical contractor charged with servicing this location. The final calculations were

performed by Powertron Global®’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer] and signed off by

Frank Ceniceros, Asst. Store manager for this Major Craft Retailer location.

The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:

kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase)

BTUH = CFM * 4.5 * Wet Bulb Enthalpy Delta

kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage

Percentage Eﬃciency = Measured BTUH / Manufacturers Design BTUH

Coeﬃcient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)

With permission of the store manager,

supply and return air DB and WB readings

were taken at the vents directly below each

RTU to ensure accuracy.

Detailed Results for the Three Pilot RTU’s

System Description / Design Characteristics

These three RTU’s provide cooling for the Major Craft Retailer Beltline Road store located in [Texas Location]. Given the

internal load of the facility and national weather BIN data, it is estimated that the RTU’s run 4,297 hours per

year prior to the ECM being implemented.

Baseline & Energy Reporting (Post) Periods

The identical IPMVP following data points were recorded for Baseline and AERP on 10/3/13 and 11/1/13

respectively using recently NIST-calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. In all tests, the

discharge pressures of the compressors as well as the wet and dry bulb temperatures entering the coil were

very similar in both periods so no adjustments to the data was necessary. Additionally, the voltage readings

and the CFM readings were within 2% of each other so the baseline readings were used for both periods to

ensure consistency of the data. The measurements are as follows:

Results

The following are the final calculated average performance measurement improvements following the

PermaFrost NMR® AERP on the three Major Craft Retailer RTU’s.

PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for Major Craft Retailer

Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Major Craft Retailer for

implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis was used to calculate the true energy

savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This greater capacity reduces the runtime hours and in turn

reduces the annual kWh expended in the AERP. The true ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the system

was when operating at its original energy profile then subtracting the cost to operate the system at its newly restored

energy profile less the percentage of increased capacity. This regression calculation is the most scientific method of

accounting for the reduced number of hours the units will now run due to their increased capacity which allows the

units to reach set temperatures quicker and shut off sooner.

Since this regression analysis involves three units, the average kW/ton and total tons are used to calculate an average

ROI across the three units.

Adjusted kW Baseline        1.448 kW/ton * 34.47 tons = 49.91 kW

Adjusted Baseline kWh        49.91 kW * 4,297 Annual Operating Hrs = 214,463 kWh

Revised Cost to Run Baseline        214, 463 kWh * $.09 = $19,301.67

kW Post        1.121 kW/ton * 34.47 tons = 38.641 kW

Annual kWh Post         38.641 kW * 4,297 hours = 166,040 kWh

Annual Cost Post         166,040 kWh * $.09 = $14,943.60

Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Month       ($19, 301.67  – $14,943.60) /12 = $363.17

Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in three pilot systems        $4,125.00

Estimated Energy Savings Payback Period for Michael’s        $4,125 / $363.17 = 11.4 months

*Note – A cost of $.09 per kWh was used for this [Texas Location] Pilot calculation. When using the national average kWh cost

of $.105 the ROI will be 9.75 months.
