Energy Science Division
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
BTUH = CFM * 4.5 * Wet Bulb Enthalpy Delta
 
kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage
 
Percentage Eﬃciency = Measured BTUH / Manufacturers Design BTUH
 
Coeﬃcient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
With permission of the store manager, 
supply and return air DB and WB readings 
were taken at the vents directly below each 
RTU to ensure accuracy.
