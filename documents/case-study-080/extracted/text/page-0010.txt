The following are the final calculated average performance measurement improvements following the 
PermaFrost NMR® AERP on the three Major Craft Retailer RTU’s.
PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for Major Craft Retailer
Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Major Craft Retailer for 
implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis was used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This greater capacity reduces the runtime hours and in turn 
reduces the annual kWh expended in the AERP. The true ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the system 
was when operating at its original energy profile then subtracting the cost to operate the system at its newly restored 
energy profile less the percentage of increased capacity. This regression calculation is the most scientific method of 
accounting for the reduced number of hours the units will now run due to their increased capacity which allows the 
units to reach set temperatures quicker and shut off sooner. 
Since this regression analysis involves three units, the average kW/ton and total tons are used to calculate an average 
ROI across the three units.
