       Detailed Results for the Three Pilot RTU’s
System Description / Design Characteristics
These three RTU’s provide cooling for the Major Craft Retailer Beltline Road store located in [Texas Location]. Given the 
internal load of the facility and national weather BIN data, it is estimated that the RTU’s run 4,297 hours per 
year prior to the ECM being implemented.  
Baseline & Energy Reporting (Post) Periods
The identical IPMVP following data points were recorded for Baseline and AERP on 10/3/13 and 11/1/13 
respectively using recently NIST-calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. In all tests, the 
discharge pressures of the compressors as well as the wet and dry bulb temperatures entering the coil were 
very similar in both periods so no adjustments to the data was necessary. Additionally, the voltage readings 
and the CFM readings were within 2% of each other so the baseline readings were used for both periods to 
ensure consistency of the data. The measurements are as follows:
