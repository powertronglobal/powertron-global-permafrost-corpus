The ECM also produced an increase cooling capacity of 26.8%, 25%, and 10.7% respectively equating to a 
total increase of 6.29 tons or an average of 2.096 tons per RTU. Prior to the ECM, the three RTU’s 
produced a total of 27.93 tons of cooling as measured in-situ. After the ECM, the average combined 
tonnage produced increased to 34.47 tons. This 23.4% cooling capacity increase from the baseline 
performance levels led to an effective average increase in COP across the RTU’s of 29.9% and a calculated 
reduction in kWh of 52,464 or 24.55%. All of these factors directly correlate to what Major Craft Retailer will realize 
in energy savings as they operate these RTU’s in the future as well as other similar HVAC equipment 
across their portfolio.  
Following treatment, the three RTU’s also showed a combined 19.4% increase in the Enthalpy Delta 
across the coil versus the Baseline and a combined 23.6% reduction in refrigerant approach. Both of these 
are critical measurements used to determine the thermodynamic enhancement brought about by the 
PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result of the ECM improvements is an ROI to Major Craft Retailer that is measured in 
months. The tables of data used to determine the financial payback are available for review at the end of 
this report.
