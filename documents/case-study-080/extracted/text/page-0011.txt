Adjusted kW Baseline        1.448 kW/ton * 34.47 tons = 49.91 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh        49.91 kW * 4,297 Annual Operating Hrs = 214,463 kWh    
Revised Cost to Run Baseline        214, 463 kWh * $.09 = $19,301.67  
kW Post        1.121 kW/ton * 34.47 tons = 38.641 kW  
Annual kWh Post         38.641 kW * 4,297 hours = 166,040 kWh  
Annual Cost Post         166,040 kWh * $.09 = $14,943.60  
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Month       ($19, 301.67  – $14,943.60) /12 = $363.17
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in three pilot systems        $4,125.00
Estimated Energy Savings Payback Period for Michael’s        $4,125 / $363.17 = 11.4 months
*Note – A cost of $.09 per kWh was used for this [Texas Location] Pilot calculation. When using the national average kWh cost 
of $.105 the ROI will be 9.75 months.
