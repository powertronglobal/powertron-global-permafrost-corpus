Recovered Wasted Energy with ECM
2 Chillers Combined
The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration the ECM created in the treated chillers. The 
average cost to operate these chillers before being 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, was 1.39.
The average specific cost to operate these chillers after 
being treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, is currently 1.19.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ was 
expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate for a 
10-year old chillers utilizing R-22 refrigerant. The post 
results are also in line with the average improvement 
savings shown over more than 130,000 installations globally.
