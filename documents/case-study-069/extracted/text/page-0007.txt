Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
2 Chillers Combined
The following are the final calculated performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® Post 
measurement period for the Military Installation chillers.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 170 tons
*Adjusted kW Baseline: 1.39 kW/ton * 200 tons = 278 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 278 kW * 4000 Annual Operating Hrs = 1,112,000 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 1,112,000 kWh * $.10 = $111,200
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: 1.19 kW/ton * 200 tons = 238 kW
Annual kWh Post: 238 kW * 4000 hours = 952,000 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 952,000 kWh * .10 cents = $95,200
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $111,200 - $95,200 = $16,000
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $16,000 / 12 = $1,333
Initial Payback Period
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot chiller: $19,250
Estimated ROI Period for Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer on the chiller: $19,250 / $1,333 = 14.4 months
Annual Rate of Return = 83.1%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 415.6%
*Utilizing data in the charts contained in this report, to obtain true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for 
Military Installation for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate 
the true energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh 
expended in the Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chillers were when operating 
at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the 
revised cost to run the chiller at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed. This 
regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours or load the chiller 
will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the chillers to reach the internal building set 
points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
