Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results 
Chiller Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM - 2 Chillers Combined
The Military Installation has the problem of thermal degradation in its Chillers and HVAC units.
The lower operating tonnage and COP ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of 
performance and cost to operate numbers. The degraded equipment performance is costing significant money 
and wasting energy. The chillers are using significantly more energy to operate than when they were new. 
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the chillers in the baseline and 
post testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. 
The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 30 operating tons and an average 
improvement of 16.9% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the 
chillers throughout the year.
