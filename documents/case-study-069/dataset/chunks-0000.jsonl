Many industry leading \norganizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age. \nThermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVAC/R equipment that operates as a \nvapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well \ndocumented by the HVACR industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal degradation \nprevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times and additional \nkWh consumption.\nThe chillers in this study (pictured below) are \nrepresentative of a great majority of the \nportfolio of equipment operated by State Military A. If thermal degradation is \npresent in these chillers it is present in the \nentire inventory of equipment. Energy waste \ncan be calculated based on this equipment \n(portfolio representation) and then accurately \nextrapolated across the entire inventory of \nequipment.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 537, "chars": 2467, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_069_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:ccb0b543befdf7b767897cf001de8c61162b95f650f06649db58a63bc7bf485d"}

The cooling capacity the chillers produce after 10 years in service, before and after the \n \n     administration of the ECM. \n \n2.  The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the chillers can deliver as \n \n     reflected in the kW/ton measurement, before and after the administration of the ECM. \n \n3.  The thermal dynamic ability of the chillers to perform in relation to operational design, before and \n \n     after the administration of the ECM.\nMethodology\nThe measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the \nIPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted Captain Jeremy \nA. Futrell and [Infrastructure Consultant] & [Client Representative] of Infrastructure Contractor. \nNotes\nThe equipment tested (2) RTAA-100 air-cooled chillers manufactured by HVAC Equipment Manufacturer.  Both the baseline and post measurement \ns were taken with outside air temperatures of 81-82 degrees.  \nThe flow rate through the evaporators were nearly identical in the baseline and post and the return chilled water entering \nthe chiller in the baseline and post were identical so no adjustments were made.\nThe boundary of the testing was the chillers and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance \ncalculations is very high.\n \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 481, "chars": 2407, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_069_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_069_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:8ca2ec93b04f5aa82f176a4454d7de95eea30594198fa5b636703805e3c5e8b7"}

The delta of these measurements and associated \ncalculations show the amount of capacity restored.\nThe following IPMVP data points were recorded on April 22/23, 2015 using recently calibrated by NIST (National \nInstitutes of Standards and Technology) to insure GPM measurement accuracy. The remaining measurements were \ntaken directly from the chiller’s control panel. The chiller was then treated with PermaFrost NMR® on the same day and \nallowed to run normally until June 18, 2015 to ensure the patented surface science nanotechnology had ample time to seat \ninto all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All measurements were taken at identical incoming water temperatures \nas well as almost identical outdoor air temperatures.
