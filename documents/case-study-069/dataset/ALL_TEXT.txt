HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report
Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study
The purpose of this study is to verify the industry wide problem of efficiency loss in HVAC/R as projected by 
ASHRAE research and to quantify the amount of money wasted due to this loss. Many industry leading 
organizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age. 
Thermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVAC/R equipment that operates as a 
vapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well 
documented by the HVACR industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal degradation 
prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times and additional 
kWh consumption.
The chillers in this study (pictured below) are 
representative of a great majority of the 
portfolio of equipment operated by LA 
National Guard. If thermal degradation is 
present in these chillers it is present in the 
entire inventory of equipment. Energy waste 
can be calculated based on this equipment 
(portfolio representation) and then accurately 
extrapolated across the entire inventory of 
equipment.

Process
This report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of two chillers that support 
the Military Installation CMF 6050 in Pineville, LA 
Detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the pilot chillers before and after 
the installation of the ECM to determine the impact on the three key elements that greatly affect the HVAC 
power bill as they relate to the original design specifications:
 
 
1.  The cooling capacity the chillers produce after 10 years in service, before and after the 
 
     administration of the ECM. 
 
2.  The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the chillers can deliver as 
 
     reflected in the kW/ton measurement, before and after the administration of the ECM. 
 
3.  The thermal dynamic ability of the chillers to perform in relation to operational design, before and 
 
     after the administration of the ECM.
Methodology
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the 
IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted Captain Jeremy 
A. Futrell and [Infrastructure Consultant] & [Client Representative] of Infrastructure Contractor. 
Notes
The equipment tested (2) RTAA-100 air-cooled chillers manufactured by HVAC Equipment Manufacturer.  Both the baseline and post measurement 
s were taken with outside air temperatures of 81-82 degrees.  
The flow rate through the evaporators were nearly identical in the baseline and post and the return chilled water entering 
the chiller in the baseline and post were identical so no adjustments were made.
The boundary of the testing was the chillers and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance 
calculations is very high.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the pilot chillers to perform prior to the 
PermaFrost NMR® (ECM) being installed, as well as illustrate the amount of thermal degradation due in large 
part to thermal degradation within the heat exchangers.
 
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
 
• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU 
 
• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Water Temp – Saturated Evaporator Temp (CH) 
 
Notes
Following a diagnostic examination to determine the operational condition of the chillers were satisfactory, Baseline 
M&V data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. 400+ runtime hours after installation of the ECM, the M&V 
team returned on a very similar weather day to the Baseline to take Post M&V measurements in the identical fashion as 
in the Baseline and at the almost identicle outdoor air temperature. The delta of these measurements and associated 
calculations show the amount of capacity restored.
The following IPMVP data points were recorded on April 22/23, 2015 using recently calibrated by NIST (National 
Institutes of Standards and Technology) to insure GPM measurement accuracy. The remaining measurements were 
taken directly from the chiller’s control panel. The chiller was then treated with PermaFrost NMR® on the same day and 
allowed to run normally until June 18, 2015 to ensure the patented surface science nanotechnology had ample time to seat 
into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All measurements were taken at identical incoming water temperatures 
as well as almost identical outdoor air temperatures. Judd Decuir, Gregory and Sunba of the State Military A, 
witnessed the collection of the data.

Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results 
Chiller Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM - 2 Chillers Combined
The Military Installation has the problem of thermal degradation in its Chillers and HVAC units.
The lower operating tonnage and COP ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of 
performance and cost to operate numbers. The degraded equipment performance is costing significant money 
and wasting energy. The chillers are using significantly more energy to operate than when they were new. 
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the chillers in the baseline and 
post testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. 
The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 30 operating tons and an average 
improvement of 16.9% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the 
chillers throughout the year.

2 Chillers Combined
The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration the ECM created in the treated chillers. The 
average cost to operate these chillers before being 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, was 1.39.
The average specific cost to operate these chillers after 
being treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, is currently 1.19.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ was 
expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate for a 
10-year old chillers utilizing R-22 refrigerant. The post 
results are also in line with the average improvement 
savings shown over more than 130,000 installations globally.

Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
2 Chillers Combined
The following are the final calculated performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® Post 
measurement period for the Military Installation chillers.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 170 tons
*Adjusted kW Baseline: 1.39 kW/ton * 200 tons = 278 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 278 kW * 4000 Annual Operating Hrs = 1,112,000 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 1,112,000 kWh * $.10 = $111,200
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: 1.19 kW/ton * 200 tons = 238 kW
Annual kWh Post: 238 kW * 4000 hours = 952,000 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 952,000 kWh * .10 cents = $95,200
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $111,200 - $95,200 = $16,000
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $16,000 / 12 = $1,333
Initial Payback Period
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot chiller: $19,250
Estimated ROI Period for Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer on the chiller: $19,250 / $1,333 = 14.4 months
Annual Rate of Return = 83.1%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 415.6%
*Utilizing data in the charts contained in this report, to obtain true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for 
Military Installation for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate 
the true energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh 
expended in the Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chillers were when operating 
at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the 
revised cost to run the chiller at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed. This 
regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours or load the chiller 
will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the chillers to reach the internal building set 
points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.

Military Installation is Saving More than Just Energyy
By treating these pilot chillers with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the current manner in which the LA 
National Guard operates them, it will save approximately 159,200 kWh per year and all the costs associated 
with those savings. From an environmental impact standpoint, the Military Installation is also benefitting the 
surrounding community of Pineville. Imagine how great the environmental impact will be when State Military A 
after treating all their HVAC/R equipment in all their properties across their portfolio.
The 159,200 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 110 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from 
being released or any of the following:
Annual greenhouse emissions from:
