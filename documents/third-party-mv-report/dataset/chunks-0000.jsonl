Other documentation is meaningless without proof of \nperformance. Powertron Global’s Forensic Measurement & Verification (FMV) \nPlatform generates thousands of comparable before and after treatment data \nsets that are beyond scientific dispute. ASHRAE called this system a \n“breakthrough technology of 2017”.  \n \nNevertheless, customers want and deserve independent 3rd Party verification \nof performance. UL has tested PermaFrost NMR® verifying its performance \nclaims in their lab. UL testing is the gold standard in the HVAC/R industry. \nOther distinguished labs have also done the same. \n \nSome customers want to retain outside experts. There have been ~300 P.E. \nreviewed and verified studies of PermaFrost NMR® deployments over the past \ndecade. You have access to all of them.  \n \n3rd Party M&V Fact Sheet \n \n• ~300 3rd Party M&V studies  \n• Access through Tableau database \n• Video below explains how to access and how best to navigate this \nvolume of research on PermaFrost NMR® performance in the field (link)", "tokens": 272, "chars": 1157, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 1}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "", "content_hash": "sha256:34bd56be775888b51128589a9b80b1f839a755d3b1eade716782e4af0a488a76"}
