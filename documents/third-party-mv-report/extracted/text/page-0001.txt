3rd Party M&V Studies 
 
 
Summary 
 
It is about proof. Other documentation is meaningless without proof of 
performance. Powertron Global’s Forensic Measurement & Verification (FMV) 
Platform generates thousands of comparable before and after treatment data 
sets that are beyond scientific dispute. ASHRAE called this system a 
“breakthrough technology of 2017”.  
 
Nevertheless, customers want and deserve independent 3rd Party verification 
of performance. UL has tested PermaFrost NMR® verifying its performance 
claims in their lab. UL testing is the gold standard in the HVAC/R industry. 
Other distinguished labs have also done the same. 
 
Some customers want to retain outside experts. There have been ~300 P.E. 
reviewed and verified studies of PermaFrost NMR® deployments over the past 
decade. You have access to all of them.
