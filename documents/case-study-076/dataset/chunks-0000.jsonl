A fourth store (Hurricane Store\n#402)  that was initially included but later removed from the pilot for some unforeseen mechanical issues \nunrelated to the project involving one of the two main roof top units (RTUs). The primary purpose of this pilot \nproject was to demonstrate the effectiveness of implementing PermaFrost NMR® technology into the HVAC and \nrefrigeration systems located in each of the stores.  In addition to PermaFrost NMR®, a power factor technology \ncalled Circuit Master was also included in the pilot to ascertain its feasibility in future Regional Convenience Store Chain Adventure Store \napplications.\n \nIn order to provide conclusive results demonstrating the cost savings of the aforementioned energy conservation \nmeasures (ECMs), EET installed utility grade meters with logging capabilities to monitor only the HVAC and \nrefrigeration power demand and energy consumption in each store. Baseline (pre) data was collected for two \nweeks before implementing the technologies on August 21st.  Results from power factor correction can be \nnoticed immediately so their effect was calculated in the two days immediately preceding and following \nimplementation of the Circuit Master devices at the electrical panel.  PermaFrost NMR® requires a minimum of \n350-400 hours of operation on the two rooftops units (RTUs) and multiple refrigeration units supporting each of \nthe Regional Convenience Store Chain Adventure Stores before maximum savings are generated.  For this reason, the post data was \ncollected after 30 September 2015 yielding the results summarized in subsequent sections. \nThe HVAC and refrigeration equipment in this study are representative of a great majority of the portfolio of \nequipment operated by Regional Convenience Store Chain in their Adventure Stores. If thermal degradation is present in this pilot \nequipment, it is present in the entire inventory of Regional Convenience Store Chain cooling equipment. Energy savings calculations based \non the improvement demonstrated in the pilot equipment (portfolio representation) can then be accurately \nextrapolated across the entire inventory of equipment.\nAs demonstrated in this pilot study, PermaFrost NMR® restores the capacity of cooling systems lost over time due \nto fouling of the heat exchange surfaces. Working in a complementary fashion, the Circuit Master technology is \ndesigned to block distortions in electrical power above and below the normal signal range and contains line ﬁlter \ncapacitors to improve power factor. This allows induction power equipment such as HVAC and refrigeration \ncompressors and fans to use less energy.", "tokens": 721, "chars": 3572, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_078_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:b283ea536aa91f7c0a21fab0eca497d8198c3bb0d24d37b15a433b041b1992ed"}

This\nthermal inefficiency can increase electricity consumption by up to 30% within the\nfirst five years of the equipment's life, resulting in reduced capacity, lower\nefficiency, and higher operating costs.\nPermaFrost NMR® addresses this degradation by creating a permanent thermal metal coating\non the internal surfaces of the coil system. This coating conditions the metal surfaces,\nimproving volumetric heat transfer properties and restoring capacity, all while also\nprotecting against corrosion. Working together, the kilowatt consumption of \nyour HVAC system is reduced signiﬁcantly, lowering the cost to produce each ton of cooling. The installation of \nPermaFrost NMR® does not require any additional hardware, maintenance or downtime for installation, and will \nlast for the life of the unit.\nCircuit Master®\nCircuit Master is a product that blocks distortions in electrical power above and \nbelow the normal signal range and contains line ﬁlter capacitors to improve \npower factor.  This allows induction power equipment such as HVAC, \nrefrigeration, motors and pumps to use less energy.  Equipment lifespan is also \nincreased and maintenance costs are reduced. This equipment is installed at \nthe disconnect for each machine.\n3\nThe improvements demonstrated in this or any ﬁeld test resulting from PermaFrost NMR are dependent on factors \nsuch as age, condition, service history, runtime of one or both compressors and the design and application of \neach unit. The PermaFrost NMR results in this pilot were very consistent with 13-year historical performance \naverages as well as the recent laboratory study completed on the PermaFrost NMR technology in May, 2015 by \nUnderwriters Laboratories in their testing chambers in [Texas Location], TX.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 769, "chars": 3757, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_078_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_078_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:e7137ef57770f2da7cf93133f2d55e264f4d3d5e8b956813972ceec29d7f92d1"}

As such, EET installed \ntemperature monitors in each of the pilot stores. For completeness, internal temperatures were also collected on \ntwo other Regional Convenience Store Chain Adventure Stores in the same geographical area that were not included in this pilot.   \nAs illustrated in the chart below, the initial temperature analysis substantiated the team’s concerns that the \nHurricane location had a signiﬁcantly higher temperature than all other stores due to HVAC maintenance issues \nunrelated to PermaFrost NMR® that were not corrected in a timely manner.  For this reason, the Hurricane \nAdventure Store was removed from the analysis.\nThe temperature analysis also showed that the Washington Adventure Store was operating at a much lower \ninternal temperature than all the other stores. This presents an opportunity where the thermostat set points on the \nRTUs could be increased to save an additional 4% of the overall HVAC energy while maintaining the same \ncomfort level as the other Regional Convenience Store Chain Adventure Stores.\n6\nInternal Regional Convenience Store Chain Adventure Store Temperature Comparison\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\n!\nYear-Over-Year Energy Comparisons  \nThe energy bills for the three Maverick Adventure Stores with no year-over-year anomalies (St. George, \nWashington and La Verkin) are made of up two primary components, the energy (KWH) and demand usage.  As \nillustrated in the table below, of these three locations, the combined results present a 16% energy year-over-year \nsavings coupled with a demand reduction of 16.1% year-over-year.  \nTable: Combined Savings of Energy and Demand Year-Over-Year\nBaseline & Post Energy Meter Analysis\nThe main purpose of the pilot was to show the energy savings when evaluating the Baseline (before) and Post \n(after) performance of the two ECMs, PermaFrost NMR and Circuit Masters. The energy data was collected \nsimultaneously in each of the three stores on identical utility grade power meters set up to only measure the \nHVAC and refrigeration equipment every 15 minutes.  The data for each store was then grouped by similar \nexterior weather conditions in the respective baseline and post periods and then averaged together to get an \naccurate analysis of savings provided by the two ECMs. \nThe data in the following sections describe the ﬁndings at each Regional Convenience Store Chain Adventure Store pilot location.\n7\nSt George\nWashington\nLa Verkin\nAverage Savings\nPermaFrost NMR® Reductions \nAdventure Store\nLocations\n11.8%\n7.2%\n11.7%\n10.2%\n11.1%\n2.6%\n11.3%\n8.3%\nEnergy\nDemand\nCircuit Master    \n4.9%\n7.3%\n5.1%\n5.8%\n5.3%\n9.7%\n8.5%\n7.8%\nEnergy\nDemand\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 811, "chars": 3750, "pages": {"start": 5, "end": 7}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_078_chunk_0004", "next_id": "pdf_078_chunk_0006", "content_hash": "sha256:c29023f9a6c099e04e7f4dbf87eb0d12bd3db5628ed66a4b76ee801850a2d0c5"}
