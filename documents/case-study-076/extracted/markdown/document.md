Pilot Overview

From August to October 2015, Energy Efﬁcient Technologies, LLC (EET) and Powertron Global (PTG), conducted a

joint pilot project on three Regional Convenience Store Chain stores located in and around St. George, Utah.  A fourth store (Hurricane Store

#402)  that was initially included but later removed from the pilot for some unforeseen mechanical issues

unrelated to the project involving one of the two main roof top units (RTUs). The primary purpose of this pilot

project was to demonstrate the effectiveness of implementing PermaFrost NMR® technology into the HVAC and

refrigeration systems located in each of the stores.  In addition to PermaFrost NMR®, a power factor technology

called Circuit Master was also included in the pilot to ascertain its feasibility in future Regional Convenience Store Chain Adventure Store

applications.

In order to provide conclusive results demonstrating the cost savings of the aforementioned energy conservation

measures (ECMs), EET installed utility grade meters with logging capabilities to monitor only the HVAC and

refrigeration power demand and energy consumption in each store. Baseline (pre) data was collected for two

weeks before implementing the technologies on August 21st.  Results from power factor correction can be

noticed immediately so their effect was calculated in the two days immediately preceding and following

implementation of the Circuit Master devices at the electrical panel.  PermaFrost NMR® requires a minimum of

350-400 hours of operation on the two rooftops units (RTUs) and multiple refrigeration units supporting each of

the Regional Convenience Store Chain Adventure Stores before maximum savings are generated.  For this reason, the post data was

collected after 30 September 2015 yielding the results summarized in subsequent sections.

The HVAC and refrigeration equipment in this study are representative of a great majority of the portfolio of

equipment operated by Regional Convenience Store Chain in their Adventure Stores. If thermal degradation is present in this pilot

equipment, it is present in the entire inventory of Regional Convenience Store Chain cooling equipment. Energy savings calculations based

on the improvement demonstrated in the pilot equipment (portfolio representation) can then be accurately

extrapolated across the entire inventory of equipment.

As demonstrated in this pilot study, PermaFrost NMR® restores the capacity of cooling systems lost over time due

to fouling of the heat exchange surfaces. Working in a complementary fashion, the Circuit Master technology is

designed to block distortions in electrical power above and below the normal signal range and contains line ﬁlter

capacitors to improve power factor. This allows induction power equipment such as HVAC and refrigeration

compressors and fans to use less energy.  The restoration of cooling system capacity combined with improved

power will manifest itself in any or all of the following ways:

• Ability of the equipment to better satisfy ﬂuctuating store and efrigeration loads

• Produce additional cooling redundancy at no extra cost or interruption to store operations

• Improve cooling equipment efﬁciency, lowering cost to produce each ton of cooling required

• Restore thermal efﬁciency, allowing cooling equipment to achieve thermostat set points faster

• Reduce unscheduled maintenance issues and extend equipment life by 15% or more

• Reduce overall energy consumption and peak demand charges (KVA)

ECM Descriptions

PermaFrost NMR®

Even though the HVAC units at these locations appear to be in good

working condition, there is still an opportunity for energy savings.

All HVAC equipment experiences thermal degradation over time as internal surfaces

of heat exchangers lose their optimal thermal transfer characteristics. This

thermal inefficiency can increase electricity consumption by up to 30% within the

first five years of the equipment's life, resulting in reduced capacity, lower

efficiency, and higher operating costs.

PermaFrost NMR® addresses this degradation by creating a permanent thermal metal coating

on the internal surfaces of the coil system. This coating conditions the metal surfaces,

improving volumetric heat transfer properties and restoring capacity, all while also

protecting against corrosion. Working together, the kilowatt consumption of

your HVAC system is reduced signiﬁcantly, lowering the cost to produce each ton of cooling. The installation of

PermaFrost NMR® does not require any additional hardware, maintenance or downtime for installation, and will

last for the life of the unit.

Circuit Master®

Circuit Master is a product that blocks distortions in electrical power above and

below the normal signal range and contains line ﬁlter capacitors to improve

power factor.  This allows induction power equipment such as HVAC,

refrigeration, motors and pumps to use less energy.  Equipment lifespan is also

increased and maintenance costs are reduced. This equipment is installed at

the disconnect for each machine.

3

The improvements demonstrated in this or any ﬁeld test resulting from PermaFrost NMR are dependent on factors

such as age, condition, service history, runtime of one or both compressors and the design and application of

each unit. The PermaFrost NMR results in this pilot were very consistent with 13-year historical performance

averages as well as the recent laboratory study completed on the PermaFrost NMR technology in May, 2015 by

Underwriters Laboratories in their testing chambers in [Texas Location], TX.

Monitoring Store Environments

A key component of this pilot was to ensure the comfort of the Regional Convenience Store Chain Adventure Store customers and store

personnel remained consistent while reducing the energy consumption required to do so.  As such, EET installed

temperature monitors in each of the pilot stores. For completeness, internal temperatures were also collected on

two other Regional Convenience Store Chain Adventure Stores in the same geographical area that were not included in this pilot.

As illustrated in the chart below, the initial temperature analysis substantiated the team’s concerns that the

Hurricane location had a signiﬁcantly higher temperature than all other stores due to HVAC maintenance issues

unrelated to PermaFrost NMR® that were not corrected in a timely manner.  For this reason, the Hurricane

Adventure Store was removed from the analysis.

The temperature analysis also showed that the Washington Adventure Store was operating at a much lower

internal temperature than all the other stores. This presents an opportunity where the thermostat set points on the

RTUs could be increased to save an additional 4% of the overall HVAC energy while maintaining the same

comfort level as the other Regional Convenience Store Chain Adventure Stores.

Year-Over-Year Energy Comparisons

The energy bills for the three Maverick Adventure Stores with no year-over-year anomalies (St. George,

Washington and La Verkin) are made of up two primary components, the energy (KWH) and demand usage.  As

illustrated in the table below, of these three locations, the combined results present a 16% energy year-over-year

savings coupled with a demand reduction of 16.1% year-over-year.

Table: Combined Savings of Energy and Demand Year-Over-Year

Baseline & Post Energy Meter Analysis

The main purpose of the pilot was to show the energy savings when evaluating the Baseline (before) and Post

(after) performance of the two ECMs, PermaFrost NMR and Circuit Masters. The energy data was collected

simultaneously in each of the three stores on identical utility grade power meters set up to only measure the

HVAC and refrigeration equipment every 15 minutes.  The data for each store was then grouped by similar

exterior weather conditions in the respective baseline and post periods and then averaged together to get an

accurate analysis of savings provided by the two ECMs.

The data in the following sections describe the ﬁndings at each Regional Convenience Store Chain Adventure Store pilot location.

Using the HVAC and refrigeration data from the pilot baseline

performance and applying these values to the monthly energy

consumption, it was determined that cooling accounted for approximately

60% of the energy (KWH) on the energy bill.  This data is also combined

with the lighting audit that was also performed to provide a breakout of

energy consumption as shown below in the store energy proﬁle.

The collected monthly bills

show a total of $41,070 a

year, where HVAC and

approximately $23,451 (after

customer charges).  The

results of the pilot project

presented an overall

reduction of 16.7% on energy
