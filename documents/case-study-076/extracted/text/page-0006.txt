Monitoring Store Environments   
A key component of this pilot was to ensure the comfort of the Regional Convenience Store Chain Adventure Store customers and store 
personnel remained consistent while reducing the energy consumption required to do so.  As such, EET installed 
temperature monitors in each of the pilot stores. For completeness, internal temperatures were also collected on 
two other Regional Convenience Store Chain Adventure Stores in the same geographical area that were not included in this pilot.   
As illustrated in the chart below, the initial temperature analysis substantiated the team’s concerns that the 
Hurricane location had a signiﬁcantly higher temperature than all other stores due to HVAC maintenance issues 
unrelated to PermaFrost NMR® that were not corrected in a timely manner.  For this reason, the Hurricane 
Adventure Store was removed from the analysis.
The temperature analysis also showed that the Washington Adventure Store was operating at a much lower 
internal temperature than all the other stores. This presents an opportunity where the thermostat set points on the 
RTUs could be increased to save an additional 4% of the overall HVAC energy while maintaining the same 
comfort level as the other Regional Convenience Store Chain Adventure Stores.
