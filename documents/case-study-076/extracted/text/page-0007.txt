Year-Over-Year Energy Comparisons  
The energy bills for the three Maverick Adventure Stores with no year-over-year anomalies (St. George, 
Washington and La Verkin) are made of up two primary components, the energy (KWH) and demand usage.  As 
illustrated in the table below, of these three locations, the combined results present a 16% energy year-over-year 
savings coupled with a demand reduction of 16.1% year-over-year.

Baseline & Post Energy Meter Analysis
The main purpose of the pilot was to show the energy savings when evaluating the Baseline (before) and Post 
(after) performance of the two ECMs, PermaFrost NMR and Circuit Masters. The energy data was collected 
simultaneously in each of the three stores on identical utility grade power meters set up to only measure the 
HVAC and refrigeration equipment every 15 minutes.  The data for each store was then grouped by similar 
exterior weather conditions in the respective baseline and post periods and then averaged together to get an 
accurate analysis of savings provided by the two ECMs. 
The data in the following sections describe the ﬁndings at each Regional Convenience Store Chain Adventure Store pilot location.
