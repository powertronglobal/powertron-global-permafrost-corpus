Figure: Year of Energy Bills
Figure: St. George Store Energy Proﬁle

Using the HVAC and refrigeration data from the pilot baseline 
performance and applying these values to the monthly energy 
consumption, it was determined that cooling accounted for approximately 
60% of the energy (KWH) on the energy bill.  This data is also combined 
with the lighting audit that was also performed to provide a breakout of 
energy consumption as shown below in the store energy proﬁle.  
The collected monthly bills 
show a total of $41,070 a 
year, where HVAC and 
refrigeration costs are 
approximately $23,451 (after 
customer charges).  The 
results of the pilot project 
presented an overall 
reduction of 16.7% on energy 
and 16.4% on demand.
