Figure: Washington Store Energy Proﬁle
Using the HVAC and refrigeration data from the pilot baseline 
performance and applying these values to the monthly energy 
consumption, it was determined that cooling accounted for approximately 
60% of the energy (KWH) on the energy bill.  This data is also combined 
with the lighting audit that was also performed to provide a breakout of 
energy consumption as shown below in the store energy proﬁle.  
The collected monthly bills 
show a total of $41,952 a 
year, where HVAC and 
refrigeration costs are 
approximately $22,429 (after 
energy taxes and customer 
charges).  The results of the 
pilot project presented a 
reduction of 14.5% on energy 
and 12.3% on demand.
