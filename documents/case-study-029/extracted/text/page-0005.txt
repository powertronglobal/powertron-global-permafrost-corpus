Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Split System Unit Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Major Global Bank is experiencing significant thermal degradation in its HVAC/R units.  The lower baseline operating 
tonnage and COP ratings are calculated based on historical data and are in line with the ASHRAE loss of 
performance and cost to operate numbers. The degraded equipment performance was costing Major Global Bank significant 
money and wasting energy in the four treated units before PermaFrost NMR® was added in 2008. The 
equipment was using significantly more kWh to operate than they did when they were new.
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the DX units in the baseline and 
post testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. The implementation of PermaFrost 
NMR® ECM in the four units averaging approximately 5 years of age at the time resulted in a restoration of 
3.94 operating tons and an average improvement of 15.4% in kilowatt per ton (kW/ton) significantly reducing 
the cost to operate the units throughout the year.
