HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report

Purpose of the Study

The purpose of this study is to verify that the restored capacity produced six years+ ago when all four plit

system DX units were first treated with the PermaFrost NMR® is being sustained. This same efficiency

improvement is then quantified into dollars saved by Major Global Bank in the treated units.

The split system units involved in this study are representative of a great majority of the portfolio of equipment

operated by Major Global Bank. The same information gathered in the study is then extrapolated out across the entire Major Global Bank

portfolio to closely estimate what capacity has already been lost in term of increased energy costs. This same

extrapolation methodology is also used to estimate what the potential future avoided wasted energy costs are

expected to be when treating all DX units types.

Many industry leading organizations, including the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air

Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), project that all heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration

(HVACR) units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they operate and age. Thermal degradation is caused by a

phenomenon that is present in all HVACR equipment that operates as a vapor compression cycle associated

with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well documented by the HVACR industry

and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal degradation prevents units from operating at the

original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times and additional kWh consumption.

Process

This report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of four similar DX units

treated over six years ago with PermaFrost NMR® compared to where ASHRAE degradation averages had

them performing prior to treatment.

Detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the DX units after the

installation of PermaFrost NMR® to determine the impact on the three key elements that greatly affect Major Global Bank’s

power bill as they relate to the original design specifications:

1. The cooling capacity the units are capable of producing after an average of 10.5 years in service.

2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the units are delivering as

reflected in the kW/ton measurement.

3. The thermal dynamic ability of the units to continue to perform at or close to operational design.

Methodology

The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the

IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted of Powertron Global

Global’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer].

Notes

The readings were taken in the same conditions used by Air-Conditioning, Heating, & Refrigeration Institute (AHRI) to

issue capacity ratings. All RTU’s were tested in sunny conditions with outside air temperatures between 83-87 degrees.

The boundary of the testing were the DX units and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance

calculations is very high.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)

The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the split systems to perform prior to and

following the PermaFrost NMR® ECM being installed. The report will also illustrate the amount of thermal

degradation that had occurred due in large part to thermal degradation within the heat exchangers and how much of

that has been restored.

The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan.

The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:

• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase)

• Tons = (Airflow * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta) / 12,000

• KW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage

• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)

• Seasonal Efficiency Energy Ratio (SEER) = COP x 3.792

Notes

Following a diagnostic examination of the equipment to determine the operational condition of the system was still

satisfactory; six-year post ECM data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. The delta of these measurements

versus the design data show the amount of capacity still present and the amount of money saved.

The following IPMVP data points were recorded on 28 October 2014 using recently purchased devices calibrated in

accordance with NIST (National Institutes of Standards and Technology) standards to insure measurement accuracy.

The units were initially treated with the ECM in 20 August 2008. The six years since then not only ensures the ECM

had ample time to prove longevity of the thermal benefits.

The collection of the data in the post period was collected by Powertron Global® and visual evidence of all measurements

used in the calculations in this report are available. The detailed measurements are listed further below.

Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Split System Unit Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM

Major Global Bank is experiencing significant thermal degradation in its HVAC/R units.  The lower baseline operating

tonnage and COP ratings are calculated based on historical data and are in line with the ASHRAE loss of

performance and cost to operate numbers. The degraded equipment performance was costing Major Global Bank significant

money and wasting energy in the four treated units before PermaFrost NMR® was added in 2008. The

equipment was using significantly more kWh to operate than they did when they were new.

The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the DX units in the baseline and

post testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. The implementation of PermaFrost

NMR® ECM in the four units averaging approximately 5 years of age at the time resulted in a restoration of

3.94 operating tons and an average improvement of 15.4% in kilowatt per ton (kW/ton) significantly reducing

the cost to operate the units throughout the year.

Recovered Wasted Energy with ECM

The chart to the right illustrates the performance

restoration the ECM created in the treated units. The

average cost to operate these units before they were

treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in

kW/ton, averaged 1.36.

The specific cost to operate these units after they

were treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated

in kW/ton, is currently 1.15.

The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ

was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss

of performance efficiency and cost to operate

estimate for these  units. The post results are also in

line with the average improvement savings shown

in more than 120,000 installations globally.

Major Global Bank PermaFrost® NMR 5-Yr Performance Analysis
Kilowatt Hours (kWh) Loss / Gain With / Without PermaFrost NMR® Treatment

(*)  Savings indicated inside red circle equates to a 12.3 month Initial Payback Period (IPP) for Major Global Bank when

factoring in the cost to treat the four (4) DX units at the pilot site. This is determined by dividing the $1,040

cost of treating the DX units with PermaFrost NMR® by the initial annual savings of $1,009 and multiplying

the result by 12 months.

These same savings indicated above equates to a 97% Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for Major Global Bank when treating

the four (4) DX units at the pilot site. This is determined by dividing the $1,009 estimated annual savings by

the $1,040 cost of treating the units with PermaFrost NMR® and then multiplying the result by 100.

Savings indicated inside orange circle equates to an overall ROI for Major Global Bank of 584% accrued over the past 5

years of useful equipment life. This is determined by dividing the 5 years of avoided cost savings of $6,075

by the $1,040 initial cost of treating the units with PermaFrost NMR® and then multiplying the result by 100.

The number inside purple circle equates to the average ASHRAE degradation % these units would have

currently been performing at if not treated with PermaFrost NMR more than 5 years ago. Following detailed

IPMVP testing the units were restored to near initial design capacity or slightly above.

All calculations are based on the four (4) DX units each running 3,980 hours per year while paying $0.12 per

kWh delivered while operating at just 70% load at a cost of $80 to treat each of the 13 tons. The 3,980 hours

assume the facility turns off the units rather than putting them into setback mode when the facility is closed

at night and on Sundays.
