This is imperative especially in chillers. A thorough review of \nsatisfactory recent oil analysis is required. Excessive acid and or water presence will cause the failure of results.\nYou should review this information with Powertron Global® engineering department before installation if any of these \nlevels are above the OEM allowed limits.\nOnce this has been accomplished you may proceed with the Recommendations & Requirements of PermaFrost NMR®.\nBefore you begin the installation of PermaFrost NMR®\nThe two types of PermaFrost NMR® formulas for Chiller units are synthetic and mineral. It is important that the \ncorrect PermaFrost NMR® formulation is matched to the correct  refrigerant oil type. The oil type always determines \nthe correct type of PermaFrost NMR® to be installed. On occasion, chillers are equipped with refrigerants such as \nR-22 (mineral based), but have a synthetic refrigeration oil; never assume the oil type, this must be veriﬁed.\n  \nThe installer must know how much their pump injects per stroke. For example, the Yellow Jacket Max-Flow #77930 \nthat is recommended pumps 3.8 oz. per stroke (simply approximate 4 oz.). If you use an injector or some other piece of \nequipment, follow recommend OEM guidelines for adding oil to HVAC equipment.\nRECOMMENDATIONS & REQUIREMENTS\n\n\n\nAll PermaFrost NMR® injections are measured in U.S. ﬂuid oz. The amount of PermaFrost NMR® to be installed is \ndirectly proportional to the TOTAL oil charge of the chiller. This is further explained below (Step 4) in the Instructions \nFor Installing. \nIt is recommended that the compressor remains operational during the entire installation process.\nThis will ensure that PermaFrost NMR® is throughly circulated throughout the system. \nInsure that all precautions are taken to assure that there are no residual \nproducts such as old oil or any foreign matter present in the charging apparatus.\nCare should be taken to assure the purity of the PermaFrost NMR®. \n2\n3\n4\n5\n1\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLING\nPermaFrost NMR®\nUse the same precautions handling PermaFrost NMR®, as you would while handling refrigerant oils.\n      Open the PermaFrost NMR® container and place the pickup tube into the container. A level surface is required so \nthat the oil pump is stable.\n      Connect the charging hose to the pump (if not previously done) and circulate product through the pump and \nhose while placing the hose into the PermaFrost NMR® original container. This is the approved method of purging \nair from the charging hose. Do not inject any non-condensable into any refrigeration circuit!\n      Determine if you chiller is a high or low-pressure machine.", "tokens": 685, "chars": 3033, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "dataroom_009_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:9e54546b7800ecbf64fdd05aee09c8fd130ee20bd22d993e7217fea04f895359"}

This is the approved method of purging \nair from the charging hose. Do not inject any non-condensable into any refrigeration circuit!\n      Determine if you chiller is a high or low-pressure machine. Systems using high-pressure refrigerants such as \nR-22, R-12, R-410A, R-134A etc., the best location is at the suction or (low) pressure side of the refrigeration circuit \nthrough the refrigerant service valve with compressor operating.\nIf your system is a low-pressure machine (R-11, R-123, etc.) centrifugal chiller, a pump may not be required as the \ninherent suction properties can deliver the PermaFrost NMR® right into the system at the service valve just prior to \nthe suction orifice right before the evaporator. If the chiller is a low-pressure screw or reciprocating type chiller, a \npump will still be required and the correct amount of PermaFrost NMR® would be installed in the service valve \nlocated at the suction side of the compressor while the compressor is operating.\n \n      The amount of PermaFrost NMR® installed is directly proportional to the total oil charge of the chiller, \nspecifically 10% of the total oil charge. (ex. 10 gal. total oil charge = 1 gal. of PermaFrost NMR®). Assistance is \navailable through Powertron Global®; please have chiller Make, Model, Oil Type and Refrigerant Type made \navailable for the representative. \n      Once you inject the proper amount, disconnect the hose and replace the sealing fasteners on to the selected \ncharging port of the unit. Purge any residual PermaFrost NMR® into its original container.\n\n\n\nPOST INSTALLATION GUIDELINES\nAfter installing PermaFrost NMR® it is recommended to pay close attention to the compressor oil reservoir level for \nthe next 3 to 4 weeks.\nAfter the PermaFrost NMR® has had some time to circulate within the system, it has the potential to reclaim \nrefrigerant oil that may be collecting in speciﬁc areas of the heat exchangers along with possible solid debris.  \nDepending on the amount of reclaimed oil that returns to the compressor oil reservoir, it may need to be removed to \nreturn the level back to manufacturers operating ranges.\nIf an excessive amount of contaminates are present in the internal mechanical passages it may constitute the need \nfor an oil ﬁlter and/or oil change.\nPowertron Global® recommends getting an oil analysis approximately 500 hours after \nthe installation of PermaFrost NMR® to monitor level of returned contaminates.\nFor Assistance Please Call info@powertronglobal.com\nor email support@powertronglobal.com \nPowertron Global LLC. © Copyright 2019\n15402 Dexler Drive\nAustin, TX 78734\nwww.powertronglobal.com\nThis completes the PermaFrost NMR®\ninstallation process.", "tokens": 650, "chars": 2787, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_009_chunk_0001", "next_id": "", "content_hash": "sha256:1482e38b24c5bacd1039fbbe9c1d36e26d261bf33121f190d0a193a5ba438377"}
