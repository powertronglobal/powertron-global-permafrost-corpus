PermaFrost NMR®
 Installation Instructions
forChillers
The following instructions are designed
to guide licensed HVAC personnel
through the PermaFrost NMR® installation
process for water and air- cooled chillers. 
Before the HVAC personnel proceeds with the installation process, it is important to inspect the equipment to be 
treated and ensure that it is in proper working order. This is imperative especially in chillers. A thorough review of 
satisfactory recent oil analysis is required. Excessive acid and or water presence will cause the failure of results.
You should review this information with Powertron Global® engineering department before installation if any of these 
levels are above the OEM allowed limits.
Once this has been accomplished you may proceed with the Recommendations & Requirements of PermaFrost NMR®.
Before you begin the installation of PermaFrost NMR®
The two types of PermaFrost NMR® formulas for Chiller units are synthetic and mineral. It is important that the 
correct PermaFrost NMR® formulation is matched to the correct  refrigerant oil type. The oil type always determines 
the correct type of PermaFrost NMR® to be installed. On occasion, chillers are equipped with refrigerants such as 
R-22 (mineral based), but have a synthetic refrigeration oil; never assume the oil type, this must be veriﬁed.
  
The installer must know how much their pump injects per stroke. For example, the Yellow Jacket Max-Flow #77930 
that is recommended pumps 3.8 oz. per stroke (simply approximate 4 oz.). If you use an injector or some other piece of 
equipment, follow recommend OEM guidelines for adding oil to HVAC equipment.
RECOMMENDATIONS & REQUIREMENTS

All PermaFrost NMR® injections are measured in U.S. ﬂuid oz. The amount of PermaFrost NMR® to be installed is 
directly proportional to the TOTAL oil charge of the chiller. This is further explained below (Step 4) in the Instructions 
For Installing. 
It is recommended that the compressor remains operational during the entire installation process.
This will ensure that PermaFrost NMR® is throughly circulated throughout the system. 
Insure that all precautions are taken to assure that there are no residual 
products such as old oil or any foreign matter present in the charging apparatus.
Care should be taken to assure the purity of the PermaFrost NMR®.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLING
PermaFrost NMR®
Use the same precautions handling PermaFrost NMR®, as you would while handling refrigerant oils.
      Open the PermaFrost NMR® container and place the pickup tube into the container. A level surface is required so 
that the oil pump is stable.
      Connect the charging hose to the pump (if not previously done) and circulate product through the pump and 
hose while placing the hose into the PermaFrost NMR® original container. This is the approved method of purging 
air from the charging hose. Do not inject any non-condensable into any refrigeration circuit!
      Determine if you chiller is a high or low-pressure machine. Systems using high-pressure refrigerants such as 
R-22, R-12, R-410A, R-134A etc., the best location is at the suction or (low) pressure side of the refrigeration circuit 
through the refrigerant service valve with compressor operating.
If your system is a low-pressure machine (R-11, R-123, etc.) centrifugal chiller, a pump may not be required as the 
inherent suction properties can deliver the PermaFrost NMR® right into the system at the service valve just prior to 
the suction orifice right before the evaporator. If the chiller is a low-pressure screw or reciprocating type chiller, a 
pump will still be required and the correct amount of PermaFrost NMR® would be installed in the service valve 
located at the suction side of the compressor while the compressor is operating.
 
      The amount of PermaFrost NMR® installed is directly proportional to the total oil charge of the chiller, 
specifically 10% of the total oil charge. (ex. 10 gal. total oil charge = 1 gal. of PermaFrost NMR®). Assistance is 
available through Powertron Global®; please have chiller Make, Model, Oil Type and Refrigerant Type made 
available for the representative. 
      Once you inject the proper amount, disconnect the hose and replace the sealing fasteners on to the selected 
charging port of the unit. Purge any residual PermaFrost NMR® into its original container.

POST INSTALLATION GUIDELINES
After installing PermaFrost NMR® it is recommended to pay close attention to the compressor oil reservoir level for 
the next 3 to 4 weeks.
After the PermaFrost NMR® has had some time to circulate within the system, it has the potential to reclaim 
refrigerant oil that may be collecting in speciﬁc areas of the heat exchangers along with possible solid debris.  
Depending on the amount of reclaimed oil that returns to the compressor oil reservoir, it may need to be removed to 
return the level back to manufacturers operating ranges.
If an excessive amount of contaminates are present in the internal mechanical passages it may constitute the need 
for an oil ﬁlter and/or oil change.
Powertron Global® recommends getting an oil analysis approximately 500 hours after 
the installation of PermaFrost NMR® to monitor level of returned contaminates.
