POST INSTALLATION GUIDELINES
After installing PermaFrost NMR® it is recommended to pay close attention to the compressor oil reservoir level for 
the next 3 to 4 weeks.
After the PermaFrost NMR® has had some time to circulate within the system, it has the potential to reclaim 
refrigerant oil that may be collecting in speciﬁc areas of the heat exchangers along with possible solid debris.  
Depending on the amount of reclaimed oil that returns to the compressor oil reservoir, it may need to be removed to 
return the level back to manufacturers operating ranges.
If an excessive amount of contaminates are present in the internal mechanical passages it may constitute the need 
for an oil ﬁlter and/or oil change.
Powertron Global® recommends getting an oil analysis approximately 500 hours after 
the installation of PermaFrost NMR® to monitor level of returned contaminates.
