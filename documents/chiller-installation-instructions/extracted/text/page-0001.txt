PermaFrost NMR®
 Installation Instructions
forChillers
The following instructions are designed
to guide licensed HVAC personnel
through the PermaFrost NMR® installation
process for water and air- cooled chillers. 
Before the HVAC personnel proceeds with the installation process, it is important to inspect the equipment to be 
treated and ensure that it is in proper working order. This is imperative especially in chillers. A thorough review of 
satisfactory recent oil analysis is required. Excessive acid and or water presence will cause the failure of results.
You should review this information with Powertron Global® engineering department before installation if any of these 
levels are above the OEM allowed limits.
Once this has been accomplished you may proceed with the Recommendations & Requirements of PermaFrost NMR®.
Before you begin the installation of PermaFrost NMR®
The two types of PermaFrost NMR® formulas for Chiller units are synthetic and mineral. It is important that the 
correct PermaFrost NMR® formulation is matched to the correct  refrigerant oil type. The oil type always determines 
the correct type of PermaFrost NMR® to be installed. On occasion, chillers are equipped with refrigerants such as 
R-22 (mineral based), but have a synthetic refrigeration oil; never assume the oil type, this must be veriﬁed.
  
The installer must know how much their pump injects per stroke. For example, the Yellow Jacket Max-Flow #77930 
that is recommended pumps 3.8 oz. per stroke (simply approximate 4 oz.). If you use an injector or some other piece of 
equipment, follow recommend OEM guidelines for adding oil to HVAC equipment.
