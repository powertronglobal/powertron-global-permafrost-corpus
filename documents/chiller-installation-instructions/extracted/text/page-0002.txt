All PermaFrost NMR® injections are measured in U.S. ﬂuid oz. The amount of PermaFrost NMR® to be installed is 
directly proportional to the TOTAL oil charge of the chiller. This is further explained below (Step 4) in the Instructions 
For Installing. 
It is recommended that the compressor remains operational during the entire installation process.
This will ensure that PermaFrost NMR® is throughly circulated throughout the system. 
Insure that all precautions are taken to assure that there are no residual 
products such as old oil or any foreign matter present in the charging apparatus.
Care should be taken to assure the purity of the PermaFrost NMR®.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLING
PermaFrost NMR®
Use the same precautions handling PermaFrost NMR®, as you would while handling refrigerant oils.
      Open the PermaFrost NMR® container and place the pickup tube into the container. A level surface is required so 
that the oil pump is stable.
      Connect the charging hose to the pump (if not previously done) and circulate product through the pump and 
hose while placing the hose into the PermaFrost NMR® original container. This is the approved method of purging 
air from the charging hose. Do not inject any non-condensable into any refrigeration circuit!
      Determine if you chiller is a high or low-pressure machine. Systems using high-pressure refrigerants such as 
R-22, R-12, R-410A, R-134A etc., the best location is at the suction or (low) pressure side of the refrigeration circuit 
through the refrigerant service valve with compressor operating.
If your system is a low-pressure machine (R-11, R-123, etc.) centrifugal chiller, a pump may not be required as the 
inherent suction properties can deliver the PermaFrost NMR® right into the system at the service valve just prior to 
the suction orifice right before the evaporator. If the chiller is a low-pressure screw or reciprocating type chiller, a 
pump will still be required and the correct amount of PermaFrost NMR® would be installed in the service valve 
located at the suction side of the compressor while the compressor is operating.
 
      The amount of PermaFrost NMR® installed is directly proportional to the total oil charge of the chiller, 
specifically 10% of the total oil charge. (ex. 10 gal. total oil charge = 1 gal. of PermaFrost NMR®). Assistance is 
available through Powertron Global®; please have chiller Make, Model, Oil Type and Refrigerant Type made 
available for the representative. 
      Once you inject the proper amount, disconnect the hose and replace the sealing fasteners on to the selected 
charging port of the unit. Purge any residual PermaFrost NMR® into its original container.
