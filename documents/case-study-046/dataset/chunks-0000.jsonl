It is a major cause \nof capacity loss in Heating, Ventilation, Air \nConditioning and Refrigeration (HVACR) systems, \npreventing them from operating at the original design \nefficiency soon after initial installation in the field. \nThe purpose of this study is to verify the effectiveness of the PermaFrost NMR® Energy Conservation Measure \n(ECM) in the water-cooled DX Chiller (DXC) pictured below at the Beverage Company Coffee & Creamery factory and \ndocument the future avoided energy costs associated with the same.  \nSummary Results\nThis comprehensive report contains specific information regarding the performance profile of a 59.8 kWR DXC \nBeverage Company Coffee & Creamery factory in Isando, South Africa.\nAt the conclusion of the pilot, the DXC showed an annual 19,536 kWh reduction while increasing the capacity \nof the DXC by 57.6% from 23.21 kWR in the baseline to 36.58 kWR in the post. The pilot DXC also showed a \n25% reduction in kWEnergy/KWRefrigeration and a 25.3% reduction in annual kW usage. These efficiency \nimprovements equate to an Initial Payback Period (IPP) of the ECM project for Beverage Company Coffee & Creamery of 19 \nmonths and a corresponding Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 56.1%  \nFurther details of the measurements are described in the various sections later in this report. All testing was \nconducted by Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer] while being assisted and \nwitnessed throughout by [Client Director of Engineering] of Beverage Company/Beverage Company and [HVAC Technician] of HVAC Contractor B.  \n1\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 701, "chars": 3012, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_047_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:93e2de748be904290de005f49d5aa81c596f48f2b1494d2ef437992b87b6e54e"}

The detailed performance \ntesting (outlined later in this report) was performed on the DXC before (baseline) and after (post) the \ninstallation of PermaFrost NMR®. \nThis testing determined the impact on three key elements relating to the original design specifications that \ngreatly affect the HVAC portion of the Beverage Company Coffee & Creamery power bill. They include:\n \n1. The cooling capacity the DXC is capable of producing after fourteen (14) years in service. \n \n2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling the DXC is delivering as \n \n    reflected in the kWEnergy /kWRefrigeration measurement. \n \n3. The thermal dynamic ability of the equipment to still perform at or close to operational design.  \nMethodology\nThe measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the \nIPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework.\n \nThe baseline day chosen to test the DXC’s \nwas an average day temperature and \nhumidity-wise for the Johannesburg area in \nthe early spring which ensured repeatability \nof similar weather for the post testing \nmeasurements.  The weather and facility \nconditions on both days provided an \nadequate heat load on the facility to ensure \nthe compressor in the system would remain \nfully loaded and running during the actual \ndata collection period. The boundary of the \ntesting was the DXC and nothing else; \ntherefore confidence in the accuracy of the \nperformance calculations is very high.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 482, "chars": 2359, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_047_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_047_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:d8b878be47d4f5398d470c33dab3852e03b8ddfbd4683dfb7afed62355b88f62"}

Approximately ten (10) months after installation of PermaFrost NMR®, the M&V team \nreturned on a very similar weather day to the Baseline to take Post M&V measurements in the identical \nfashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements and associated calculations show the amount of \ncapacity restored.\nThe following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. \nThe results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:\n \n• kW = Volts*Amps*Power Factor *√3/1000 (for 3-Phase) \n \n• kWE / kWR = Actual kWEnergy /Actual kWRefrigeration \n \n• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = 1/(kWE / kWR)\n \n• Chilled Water Delta-T = Post – Baseline Chilled Water Leaving Temperature\n \n• Actual Capacity = Evaporator Flow Rate*1*Evaporator Delta-T *4.185\nBASELINE\nPOST\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\n®\n4\nHVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results\nCost to Beverage Company Coﬀee & Creamery to Operate the DXC Baseline vs Post\nThe degraded capacity of the DXC prior to PermaFrost NMR® being implemented was costing Beverage Company Coffee & \nCreamery a similar amount in the way of wasted energy each hour the DXC was operating. The average cost to \noperate the pilot DXC as calculated in kWE/kWR was 0.48 in the Baseline. When new, the kWE/kWR rating for \nunits like these usually ranges from 0.30 – 0.35 kW/kWR when the proper sized ducting is used.\n \nThe restored average kW/kWR rating following the ECM is now 0.36. This represents a 25% reduction in \nenergy costs from the baseline for every kWR of cooling produced. This will result in an initial payback period \n(IPP) to Beverage Company of 1.58 years and an internal rate of Return (IRR) of 56.1%. Extrapolated out over just the next \nfive (5) years, this ECM project will net Beverage Company Coffee & Creamery a substantial ROI of 316% on their \ninvestment. These accumulated savings will greatly reduce the eventual CapEx costs to replace the DXC’s \nwhen they finally reach the end of their useful life.   \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 789, "chars": 3353, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_047_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_047_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:b1a63aa50f4ac1febcfb6f68eaa94831e294341e1cba6f8f41316135f4a6c417"}

This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh \nexpended in the Avoided Energy Reporting (Post) Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the \nsystems was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage \ncapacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® \nwas installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours \nthe systems will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the internal \nbuilding set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading. \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 672, "chars": 2752, "pages": {"start": 7, "end": 8}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_047_chunk_0004", "next_id": "pdf_047_chunk_0006", "content_hash": "sha256:78c88ff0180dbd73be09ae466bf476bbe77a8608b86670683a4df9bae91b6032"}
