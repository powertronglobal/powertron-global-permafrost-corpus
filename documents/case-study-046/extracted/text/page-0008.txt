Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the Beverage Company Coffee & Creamery factory.
 
Baseline Energy Consumption
Adjusted Baseline Capacity: 36.58 kWR
Adjusted kW Baseline: 0.48 kWE /kWR * 36.58 kWR = 17.6 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 17.6 kW * 4,440 Annual Operating Hrs = 78,144 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 78,144 kWh * R1.10 = R85,958
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: 0.36 kWE /kWR * 36.58 kWR = 13.2 kW
Annual kWh Post: 13.2 kW * 4,440 hours = 58,608 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 58,608 kWh * R1.10 = R64,469
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: R85,958 – R64,469= R21,489
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: R21,489 / 12 = R1,791
 
Initial Payback Period
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot DXC: R34,000
Estimated Initial Payback Period on the DXC: R34,000 / R1,791 = 19 months
Total kWh saved by treating this DXC = 19,536 kWh
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 63.2%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 316%
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for 
the Beverage Company Coffee & Creamery factory implementing PermaFrost NMR®, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate 
the true energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh 
expended in the Avoided Energy Reporting (Post) Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the 
systems was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage 
capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® 
was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours 
the systems will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the internal 
building set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
