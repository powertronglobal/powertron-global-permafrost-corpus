HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Cost to Beverage Company Coﬀee & Creamery to Operate the DXC Baseline vs Post
The degraded capacity of the DXC prior to PermaFrost NMR® being implemented was costing Beverage Company Coffee & 
Creamery a similar amount in the way of wasted energy each hour the DXC was operating. The average cost to 
operate the pilot DXC as calculated in kWE/kWR was 0.48 in the Baseline. When new, the kWE/kWR rating for 
units like these usually ranges from 0.30 – 0.35 kW/kWR when the proper sized ducting is used.
 
The restored average kW/kWR rating following the ECM is now 0.36. This represents a 25% reduction in 
energy costs from the baseline for every kWR of cooling produced. This will result in an initial payback period 
(IPP) to Beverage Company of 1.58 years and an internal rate of Return (IRR) of 56.1%. Extrapolated out over just the next 
five (5) years, this ECM project will net Beverage Company Coffee & Creamery a substantial ROI of 316% on their 
investment. These accumulated savings will greatly reduce the eventual CapEx costs to replace the DXC’s 
when they finally reach the end of their useful life.
