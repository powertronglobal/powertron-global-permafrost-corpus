Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content detailed in this report will demonstrate the ability of the pilot DXC to perform prior to the ECM 
being installed, as well as illustrate the amount of thermal degradation 
within the heat exchangers. 
Following a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to determine the operational condition of the 
system was satisfactory, Baseline Measurement and Verification (M&V) data was collected and recorded by 
the M&V team. Approximately ten (10) months after installation of PermaFrost NMR®, the M&V team 
returned on a very similar weather day to the Baseline to take Post M&V measurements in the identical 
fashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements and associated calculations show the amount of 
capacity restored.
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts*Amps*Power Factor *√3/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• kWE / kWR = Actual kWEnergy /Actual kWRefrigeration 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = 1/(kWE / kWR)
 
• Chilled Water Delta-T = Post – Baseline Chilled Water Leaving Temperature
 
• Actual Capacity = Evaporator Flow Rate*1*Evaporator Delta-T *4.185
