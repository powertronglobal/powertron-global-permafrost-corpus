HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report

Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study

Thermal degradation is well documented by the

American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air

Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) and the original

equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). It is a major cause

of capacity loss in Heating, Ventilation, Air

Conditioning and Refrigeration (HVACR) systems,

preventing them from operating at the original design

efficiency soon after initial installation in the field.

The purpose of this study is to verify the effectiveness of the PermaFrost NMR® Energy Conservation Measure

(ECM) in the water-cooled DX Chiller (DXC) pictured below at the Beverage Company Coffee & Creamery factory and

document the future avoided energy costs associated with the same.

Summary Results

This comprehensive report contains specific information regarding the performance profile of a 59.8 kWR DXC

Beverage Company Coffee & Creamery factory in Isando, South Africa.

At the conclusion of the pilot, the DXC showed an annual 19,536 kWh reduction while increasing the capacity

of the DXC by 57.6% from 23.21 kWR in the baseline to 36.58 kWR in the post. The pilot DXC also showed a

25% reduction in kWEnergy/KWRefrigeration and a 25.3% reduction in annual kW usage. These efficiency

improvements equate to an Initial Payback Period (IPP) of the ECM project for Beverage Company Coffee & Creamery of 19

months and a corresponding Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 56.1%

Further details of the measurements are described in the various sections later in this report. All testing was

conducted by Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer] while being assisted and

witnessed throughout by [Client Director of Engineering] of Beverage Company/Beverage Company and [HVAC Technician] of HVAC Contractor B.

Process

This comprehensive report contains specific information regarding the performance profile of a single

water-cooled DX chiller (DXC) that supports the Beverage Company Coffee & Creamery factory. The detailed performance

testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the DXC before (baseline) and after (post) the

installation of PermaFrost NMR®.

This testing determined the impact on three key elements relating to the original design specifications that

greatly affect the HVAC portion of the Beverage Company Coffee & Creamery power bill. They include:

1. The cooling capacity the DXC is capable of producing after fourteen (14) years in service.

2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling the DXC is delivering as

reflected in the kWEnergy /kWRefrigeration measurement.

3. The thermal dynamic ability of the equipment to still perform at or close to operational design.

Methodology

The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the

IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework.

The baseline day chosen to test the DXC’s

was an average day temperature and

humidity-wise for the Johannesburg area in

the early spring which ensured repeatability

of similar weather for the post testing

measurements.  The weather and facility

conditions on both days provided an

adequate heat load on the facility to ensure

the compressor in the system would remain

fully loaded and running during the actual

data collection period. The boundary of the

testing was the DXC and nothing else;

therefore confidence in the accuracy of the

performance calculations is very high.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)

The content detailed in this report will demonstrate the ability of the pilot DXC to perform prior to the ECM

being installed, as well as illustrate the amount of thermal degradation

within the heat exchangers.

Following a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to determine the operational condition of the

system was satisfactory, Baseline Measurement and Verification (M&V) data was collected and recorded by

the M&V team. Approximately ten (10) months after installation of PermaFrost NMR®, the M&V team

returned on a very similar weather day to the Baseline to take Post M&V measurements in the identical

fashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements and associated calculations show the amount of

capacity restored.

The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan.

The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:

• kW = Volts*Amps*Power Factor *√3/1000 (for 3-Phase)

• kWE / kWR = Actual kWEnergy /Actual kWRefrigeration

• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = 1/(kWE / kWR)

• Chilled Water Delta-T = Post – Baseline Chilled Water Leaving Temperature

• Actual Capacity = Evaporator Flow Rate*1*Evaporator Delta-T *4.185

HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results

Cost to Beverage Company Coﬀee & Creamery to Operate the DXC Baseline vs Post

The degraded capacity of the DXC prior to PermaFrost NMR® being implemented was costing Beverage Company Coffee &

Creamery a similar amount in the way of wasted energy each hour the DXC was operating. The average cost to

operate the pilot DXC as calculated in kWE/kWR was 0.48 in the Baseline. When new, the kWE/kWR rating for

units like these usually ranges from 0.30 – 0.35 kW/kWR when the proper sized ducting is used.

The restored average kW/kWR rating following the ECM is now 0.36. This represents a 25% reduction in

energy costs from the baseline for every kWR of cooling produced. This will result in an initial payback period

(IPP) to Beverage Company of 1.58 years and an internal rate of Return (IRR) of 56.1%. Extrapolated out over just the next

five (5) years, this ECM project will net Beverage Company Coffee & Creamery a substantial ROI of 316% on their

investment. These accumulated savings will greatly reduce the eventual CapEx costs to replace the DXC’s

when they finally reach the end of their useful life.

The chart to the right illustrates the performance

restoration PermaFrost NMR® created in the

treated DXC. The average cost to operate this DXC

before it was treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as

calculated in kWE/kWR, was 0.48.

The specific cost to operate this DXC after it was

treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in

kWE/kWR, is currently 0.36.

The baseline kWE/kWR ratings measured in-situ were consistent within the expected range when

compared to the ASHRAE loss of performance efficiency and cost to operate estimations for this fourteen

(14) year old equipment with this amount of annual operating hours. The post results are also in line with

the average improvement savings shown over more than 125,000 installations globally.

Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics

The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR®

Post measurement period for the Beverage Company Coffee & Creamery factory.

Baseline Energy Consumption

Adjusted Baseline Capacity: 36.58 kWR
Adjusted kW Baseline: 0.48 kWE /kWR * 36.58 kWR = 17.6 kW

Adjusted Baseline kWh: 17.6 kW * 4,440 Annual Operating Hrs = 78,144 kWh

Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 78,144 kWh * R1.10 = R85,958

Post Energy Consumption

kW Post: 0.36 kWE /kWR * 36.58 kWR = 13.2 kW

Annual kWh Post: 13.2 kW * 4,440 hours = 58,608 kWh

Annual Cost Post: 58,608 kWh * R1.10 = R64,469

Savings Per Year

Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: R85,958 – R64,469= R21,489

Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: R21,489 / 12 = R1,791

Initial Payback Period

Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot DXC: R34,000

Estimated Initial Payback Period on the DXC: R34,000 / R1,791 = 19 months

Total kWh saved by treating this DXC = 19,536 kWh

Annual Internal Rate of Return = 63.2%

Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 316%

Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for

the Beverage Company Coffee & Creamery factory implementing PermaFrost NMR®, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate

the true energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh

expended in the Avoided Energy Reporting (Post) Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the

systems was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage

capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR®

was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours

the systems will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the internal

building set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.

Beverage Company is Saving More than just Energy at the
Coﬀee & Creamery Factory

By treating the DXC with PermaFrost NMR® and based on the current manner in which they currently

operate the unit, Beverage Company Coffee & Creamery will save approximately 19,536 kWh per year and all the costs

associated with those savings. From an environmental impact standpoint, the factory is also benefitting the

surrounding community. Imagine how great the environmental impact will be when Beverage Company/Beverage Company moves

forward with treating all their HVAC equipment in all their companies across South Africa.

The 19,536 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 13.5 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from

being released or any of the following:

Annual greenhouse emissions from:
