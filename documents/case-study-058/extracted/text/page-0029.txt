                     Outdoor side 
dry bulb temperature 34.98°C 
                                          Air outlet static pressure 0Pa 
2. The refrigerating capacity, input power, dry bulb temperature at 
evaporator air outlet, wet bulb temperature at evaporator air outlet listed in 
the table are tested according to the provisions of Chinese Standard GB/T 
7,725-2,004. 
3. The refrigerant used in this test is R22, and its filling volume is 1670g.  
4. The refrigerating capacity, input power, dry bulb temperature at 
evaporator air outlet, and wet bulb temperature at evaporator air outlet listed 
in this table were measured after the machine had been in operation for 15 
hours following filling of 50 ml of the PFHCFC model of PermaFrost III 
refrigerant.
