Important Manufacturer's Note
     PermaFrost® is designed to allow the system to achieve thermostat set points faster thereby allowing 
the unit to cycle off or cycle down to provide the greatest energy savings.  The proper way to measure the full 
benefits of PermaFrost® include allowing the system to cycle on and off normally and measure kWh use 
over time.
 
Significantly greater energy savings are measurable when the process of recycling air (cooling cooler air) 
and measuring kWh use over time are included in the test.  This test is designed to measure efficiency 
improvemnet only when the unit is running.  This test does not take into account the exponential benifit of 
coolong cooler air and the full energy savings derived from producing colder air.  Increased cooling capacity 
allows the system to reach the thermostat set point temperature quicker.  The energy savings not accounted 
for in this test is the energy saved due to reduced runtime.  
 
With PermaFrost® installed the unit will acieve thermostat temperature setpoint faster and remain off for 
longer periods of time saving energy.
