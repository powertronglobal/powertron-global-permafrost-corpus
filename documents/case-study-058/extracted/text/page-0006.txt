Report Highlights translated into English
     Remarks,
1.   Actually condition on inspection pre-treatment
 
Indoor: Dry bulb temp: 26.95C 
 
Wet bulb temp: 18.98C
 
Outdoor: Dry bulb temp: 34.98C
 
Discharged pressure: 0Pa
2.   All the testing method for the above items included cooling capacity,  power input, 
        Dry bulb and Wet bulb temperature of Evaporator at discharged are strictly based on 
        the GB/T7725-2004 regulation standard.
3.   On this test, the refrigerant is R22.
The testing result as above was collected after post-treatment of PermaFrost® (model No: 
PFHCFC) refrigeration oil 50 ml, and then went through 15 hours non-stopped running.
        Cooling capacity increased by 2.54% in the post-treatment test.  This indicates a  significant 
improvement in heat transfer in the evaporator. 
        The COP (a ratio of the cooling capacity and power input) increased by 3.18% in  the post-treatment 
test.  This indicates a significant improvement in the overall system performance.
