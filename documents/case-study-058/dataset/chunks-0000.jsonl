The proper way to measure the full \nbenefits of PermaFrost® include allowing the system to cycle on and off normally and measure kWh use \nover time.\n \nSignificantly greater energy savings are measurable when the process of recycling air (cooling cooler air) \nand measuring kWh use over time are included in the test.  This test is designed to measure efficiency \nimprovemnet only when the unit is running.  This test does not take into account the exponential benifit of \ncoolong cooler air and the full energy savings derived from producing colder air.  Increased cooling capacity \nallows the system to reach the thermostat set point temperature quicker.  The energy savings not accounted \nfor in this test is the energy saved due to reduced runtime.  \n \nWith PermaFrost® installed the unit will acieve thermostat temperature setpoint faster and remain off for \nlonger periods of time saving energy.\n\n\n\nINSPECTION REPORT\n7\n \n \n \nBASELINE - No. 2009JC025\n     Product: Split heat pump floor-standing room air conditioner\n     Client: PST Group PTY LTD.\n     Manufacturer: Hefei Meiling Sigma Electrical Appliance Co., Ltd.
