2     Phase II quantified the energy saving (kWh) benefits directly attributable to the PermaFrost 
NMR®.  Actual kWh consumed was analyzed and compared in the 10 Major Restaurant Chain stores during the 
months of August and September of 2010 (pre-treatment) against the kWh consumed in the same two 
months of 2011 (post-treatment). The twenty months of power bill data from both the pre- and post- 
measurement periods shows a substantial 17.3% reduction in the amount of kWh's used. The number 
of Cooling Degree Days (CDDs) in these two months in 2010 and 2011 were nearly identical (732 in 
2010 vs. 730 in 2011) so no adjustments for weather were necessary. The original project involved four 
energy control measures (ECMs) installed as part of an energy savings initiative package; the 
predominant ECM during this time period being PermaFrost NMR®.
The chart on page 4 illustrates the 10 Major Restaurant Chain stores showed an average 11.1% reduction in the kWh 
usage on the the power bills directly attributable to PermaFrost NMR® (i.e., treating RTU's, Walk-in 
Coolers & Freezers, Ice Machines) and a payback period of approximately 12 months. The two-year 
post measurements in Part I above support PermaFrost NMR® achieving its expected results in 
efficiency across the 44 HVAC/R units.
