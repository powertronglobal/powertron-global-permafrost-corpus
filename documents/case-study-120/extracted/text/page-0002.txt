Product Brief
         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry ECM that uses Nucleo 
Molecular Regenerative® (NMR™) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, one-time treatment with 
no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type of system in which it 
is installed – DX (direct expansion air and chilled water systems), chillers (screw, reciprocating, scroll 
and centrifugal), heat pumps, ice making equipment. Specialized applications include computer room 
cooling and dehumidification systems, chiller plants (water and ice production applications), domestic 
and industrial refrigeration (ammonia low and ultra-low temperature), air-cooled single application 
water chillers and split and package rooftop HVAC equipment.
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and 
improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allows a system to achieve set point temperatures in a more 
rapid fashion which reduces system loading and operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from 
the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW 
hours used, less amp draw at the compressor per ton, less metallic wear, longer overall equipment life 
and a reduced carbon footprint for Major Restaurant Chain.
