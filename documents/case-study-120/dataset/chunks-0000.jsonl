A sustainable, one-time treatment with \nno down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type of system in which it \nis installed – DX (direct expansion air and chilled water systems), chillers (screw, reciprocating, scroll \nand centrifugal), heat pumps, ice making equipment. Specialized applications include computer room \ncooling and dehumidification systems, chiller plants (water and ice production applications), domestic \nand industrial refrigeration (ammonia low and ultra-low temperature), air-cooled single application \nwater chillers and split and package rooftop HVAC equipment.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and \nimproved refrigerant velocity – all of which allows a system to achieve set point temperatures in a more \nrapid fashion which reduces system loading and operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from \nthe enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW \nhours used, less amp draw at the compressor per ton, less metallic wear, longer overall equipment life \nand a reduced carbon footprint for Major Restaurant Chain.\n®\n1\nProperty of Powertron Global®\n\n\n\nOverview of Energy Study\n        In May 2013, Powertron Global® concluded a two-year, two-part energy study documenting the \nlong-term effects of PermaFrost NMR® into the climate control systems (HVACR) inside 10 Major Restaurant Chain stores. \nThe stores chosen for the study were all located in the mid-Atlantic region because this area most accurately \nrepresents the operational and energy mean average for all Major Restaurant Chain stores in United States. The study was \nconducted under the guidance of [Client Representative], P.E. MBA, Senior Energy Director, Quality Supply \nChain Co-op, Inc.\nIn the summer of 2011, the technology was installed in 24 packaged roof top units (RTUs) and 20 \nrefrigeration units supporting the 10 stores. The RTUs comprising this pilot project ranged in size from 5 to \n15-tons and involved various models from several different manufacturers. The refrigeration units were all 1 \nto 1½ ton systems common to most Major Restaurant Chain store configurations. The refrigerants involved included R22 \n(mineral-based) and R404A and R410A (synthetic-based). Based on national weather BIN data for the \nBaltimore/Annapolis/Washington areas for all the hours per year over 60 degrees, the RTUs operate \napproximately 3,896 hours each year. The refrigeration units operate nearly twice that amount of time.\nEach part of the study had one primary objective.\n1     Phase I determined the efficiency improvements directly at the unit. Scientific testing was \nconducted on a 10% sampling of the systems treated two years earlier to determine their current \noperating efficiency. The International Performance Measurement & Verification Protocol (IPMVP) \nwas followed in collecting the performance data. The results, as shown later in this study, verified that \nthe four units tested (averaging 5.5 years of age) were restored to (and are continuing to operate in a \nsustainable manner) or very near original design capacity.", "tokens": 802, "chars": 3670, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_116_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:789545f0a1ec9e995556e8d4c8f3e602fdef1e7fc5c566420575867917b82208"}

The results, as shown later in this study, verified that \nthe four units tested (averaging 5.5 years of age) were restored to (and are continuing to operate in a \nsustainable manner) or very near original design capacity. The units were also shown to be operating \nat or very near to their original kW/ton design. To quantify the expected efficiency loss and \nsubstantiate the findings, an untreated RTU (control group) installed in June of 2011 was also \nmeasured so its efficiency could be compared to the older treated units. The untreated 2-year old \ncontrol group unit has already lost 13.7% off its original design specifications through thermal heat \ntransfer degradation.\n®\n2\nProperty of Powertron Global®\n\n\n\n2     Phase II quantified the energy saving (kWh) benefits directly attributable to the PermaFrost \nNMR®.  Actual kWh consumed was analyzed and compared in the 10 Major Restaurant Chain stores during the \nmonths of August and September of 2010 (pre-treatment) against the kWh consumed in the same two \nmonths of 2011 (post-treatment). The twenty months of power bill data from both the pre- and post- \nmeasurement periods shows a substantial 17.3% reduction in the amount of kWh's used. The number \nof Cooling Degree Days (CDDs) in these two months in 2010 and 2011 were nearly identical (732 in \n2010 vs. 730 in 2011) so no adjustments for weather were necessary. The original project involved four \nenergy control measures (ECMs) installed as part of an energy savings initiative package; the \npredominant ECM during this time period being PermaFrost NMR®.\nThe chart on page 4 illustrates the 10 Major Restaurant Chain stores showed an average 11.1% reduction in the kWh \nusage on the the power bills directly attributable to PermaFrost NMR® (i.e., treating RTU's, Walk-in \nCoolers & Freezers, Ice Machines) and a payback period of approximately 12 months.
