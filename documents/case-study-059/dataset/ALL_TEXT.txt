PermaFrost NMR® Performance Report
County Law Enforcement A 
July, 2013 
Executive Summary
         This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure 
(ECM) PermaFrost NMR® in one of the two main HVAC units supporting the County Law Enforcement A MD Police 
Department located at [Government Facility Address], Ellicott City, MD. Detailed forensic performance testing 
(outlined later in this report) was performed on the nominal 26-ton split system outfitted with one 
compressor using R22 refrigerant. Following testing, the unit was treated with the proper amount and type 
of the PermaFrost NMR® technology specially formulated for these types of systems.  Measurement and 
Verification (M&V) was conducted pre-installation and post-gestation.
 
The improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at the unit was solely attributable to the 
PermaFrost NMR® ECM. This is a result of the reversal of thermal inefficiency on heat exchange surfaces.  
Following treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, the unit showed an effective net average 
15.9% reduction in kW/ton based on the exact capacity measured in the baseline M&V and the post 
gestation M&V. With the 26-ton unit operating at full load with all VAV boxes open at 100%, the system 
showed an average 1.3% reduction in kW consumption while simultaneously producing an increase in 
capacity of 3.8 tons. This 17.3% average capacity increase from the baseline performance level led to an 
effective average increase in COP of 19.4%. All of these factors directly correlate to what County Law Enforcement A 
will realize in energy savings as they operate this system in the future under the same parameters.
Following treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, the system showed an average 2% reduction 
in amp draw while at the same time the unit was doing much more work. This is illustrated by the 21% 
increase in the enthalpy delta, which is a critical HVAC measurement used to determine the 
thermodynamic enhancement brought about by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result of the ECM 
improvement is an ROI to County Law Enforcement A that is measured in months. The tables of data are available for 
review at the end of this report. Financial calculations determining the true ROI are proprietary to Howard 
County under separate cover.

Product Brief
         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure 
(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative® (NMR) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, 
one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any 
type of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and 
equipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); 
chilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia 
refrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The 
equipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single 
and multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and 
improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point temperatures in a more 
rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from the 
enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW hours 
used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced carbon footprint 
for County Law Enforcement A.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) was utilized in the 
development of this report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating, 
Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization 
(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation 
methods and products.
There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They 
are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is 
defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single 
source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM 
affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term 
measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by 
short-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations 
using measurements of proxies of energy use. 
The final computation follows the formula:
Energy Science Division
Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy
+ - Routine adjustments / + - Non-Routine Adjustments

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces.
 
A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the unit’s operational 
conditions were satisfactory. Baseline M&V were recorded and then the proper amount and type of 
PermaFrost NMR® was injected. The gestation period for the County Law Enforcement A pilot was 10 months on this 
particular unit to allow it to achieve the required ~300 hours of runtime to ensure adequate performance 
improvement time. At the end of this gestation period, Post M&V results were taken in the identical manner 
as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same or very similar entering air dry bulb and wet bulb 
temperatures as well as outside air temperatures. These are the two most critical measurements affected by 
the weather. When analyzing the data, no adjustments for weather were necessary.
The following report produces the utilization of the International Performance Measurement and 
Verification Protocol (IPMVP) as the M&V plan. Sam Schneider and Justin Envoy, County Law Enforcement A Facilities 
Support Staff, witnessed the collection of the data used in this report. The final calculations were performed 
by Powertron Global’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer].  
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
 
kW= Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase)
 
 
Btuh = CFM * 4.5 (standard air) * Calculated Enthalpy Delta 
 
 
kW per Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage
 
 
Percentage Eﬃciency = Measured BTUH / Manufacturers Design BTUH
 
 
Coeﬃcient of Performance (COP) = 3.516 / kW per ton

Baseline & Energy Reporting (Post) Periods
The identical IPMVP following data points were recorded for Baseline and Post on 8/30/12 and 6/24/13 
respectively using recently NIST calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. The Return Air dry 
bulb and wet bulb temperatures entering the coil were very similar in both periods. Additionally, the 
outside conditions in both periods were very similar so no adjustments were made to the calculations. The 
measurements are as follows:

Results
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period of Split Unit #2. 
PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for County Law Enforcement A 
Utilizing the data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and payback period for County Law Enforcement A, a 
detailed Regression Analysis is used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Split System (the constant) at the 
pre-pilot cost to operate the system (kW/Ton). This cost is then compared to the newly obtained cost to operate the 
system following the installation of PermaFrost NMR® to determine the true Payback Period for County Law Enforcement A.  
Adjusted Baseline Tonnage         25.88 tons (equates to tonnage in Post)
Adjusted kW Baseline        1.62 kW/ton * 25.88 tons = 41.93 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh        41.93 kW * 3,895 Annual Operating Hrs = 163,317 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline        163,317 kWh * $.11 = $17,964.87
kW Post        1.36 kW/ton * 25.88 tons = 35.20 kW
Annual kWh Post         35.20 kW * 3,895 hours = 137,104 kWh
Annual Cost Post         137,104 kWh * .11 cents = $15,081.44
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Month         ($17,964.87 - $15,081.44)/12 = $240.29
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed         $2,808 / $240.29 = 11.7 months
 
ROI = 12 months
