Detailed forensic performance testing \n(outlined later in this report) was performed on the nominal 26-ton split system outfitted with one \ncompressor using R22 refrigerant. Following testing, the unit was treated with the proper amount and type \nof the PermaFrost NMR® technology specially formulated for these types of systems.  Measurement and \nVerification (M&V) was conducted pre-installation and post-gestation.\n \nThe improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at the unit was solely attributable to the \nPermaFrost NMR® ECM. This is a result of the reversal of thermal inefficiency on heat exchange surfaces.  \nFollowing treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, the unit showed an effective net average \n15.9% reduction in kW/ton based on the exact capacity measured in the baseline M&V and the post \ngestation M&V. With the 26-ton unit operating at full load with all VAV boxes open at 100%, the system \nshowed an average 1.3% reduction in kW consumption while simultaneously producing an increase in \ncapacity of 3.8 tons. This 17.3% average capacity increase from the baseline performance level led to an \neffective average increase in COP of 19.4%. All of these factors directly correlate to what County Law Enforcement A \nwill realize in energy savings as they operate this system in the future under the same parameters.\nFollowing treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, the system showed an average 2% reduction \nin amp draw while at the same time the unit was doing much more work. This is illustrated by the 21% \nincrease in the enthalpy delta, which is a critical HVAC measurement used to determine the \nthermodynamic enhancement brought about by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result of the ECM \nimprovement is an ROI to County Law Enforcement A that is measured in months. The tables of data are available for \nreview at the end of this report. Financial calculations determining the true ROI are proprietary to Howard \nCounty under separate cover.  \nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 694, "chars": 3199, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_060_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:ec01f334bab8d8949dc1beed2210ea1a8c32d34d24de1612739d89a83d0d1d00"}

A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any \ntype of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and \nequipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); \nchilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia \nrefrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The \nequipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single \nand multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and \nimproved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point temperatures in a more \nrapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from the \nenhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW hours \nused, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced carbon footprint \nfor County Law Enforcement A.\nEnergy Science Division\nBOUNDARY LAYER\nOIL REMOVED\nBEFORE TREATMENT\nAFTER TREATMENT\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 448, "chars": 2143, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_060_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_060_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:813d8b4f47d58f84f73432e86be8ba30a2918b24236465ac4e653cf52861113a"}

The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating, \nRefrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization \n(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation \nmethods and products.\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is \ndefined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single \nsource of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM \naffected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations \nusing measurements of proxies of energy use. \nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+ - Routine adjustments / + - Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 435, "chars": 2157, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_060_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_060_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:47e1cb2a2a594bc0ec281de4bb2279dc3e5028775c6442f89ed7617ff031bd60"}

Baseline M&V were recorded and then the proper amount and type of \nPermaFrost NMR® was injected. The gestation period for the County Law Enforcement A pilot was 10 months on this \nparticular unit to allow it to achieve the required ~300 hours of runtime to ensure adequate performance \nimprovement time. At the end of this gestation period, Post M&V results were taken in the identical manner \nas in the baseline, taking special care to match the same or very similar entering air dry bulb and wet bulb \ntemperatures as well as outside air temperatures. These are the two most critical measurements affected by \nthe weather.
