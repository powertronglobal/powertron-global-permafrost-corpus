The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period of Split Unit #2. 
PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for County Law Enforcement A 
Utilizing the data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and payback period for County Law Enforcement A, a 
detailed Regression Analysis is used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Split System (the constant) at the 
pre-pilot cost to operate the system (kW/Ton). This cost is then compared to the newly obtained cost to operate the 
system following the installation of PermaFrost NMR® to determine the true Payback Period for County Law Enforcement A.  
Adjusted Baseline Tonnage         25.88 tons (equates to tonnage in Post)
Adjusted kW Baseline        1.62 kW/ton * 25.88 tons = 41.93 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh        41.93 kW * 3,895 Annual Operating Hrs = 163,317 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline        163,317 kWh * $.11 = $17,964.87
kW Post        1.36 kW/ton * 25.88 tons = 35.20 kW
Annual kWh Post         35.20 kW * 3,895 hours = 137,104 kWh
Annual Cost Post         137,104 kWh * .11 cents = $15,081.44
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Month         ($17,964.87 - $15,081.44)/12 = $240.29
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed         $2,808 / $240.29 = 11.7 months
 
ROI = 12 months
