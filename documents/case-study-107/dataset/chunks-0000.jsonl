The detailed performance testing (outlined \nlater in this report) was performed on the PU before (baseline) and after (post) the installation of PermaFrost \nNMR®. \nThis testing determined the impact on three key elements relating to the original design specifications that \ngreatly affect the HVAC portion of the Beverage Company B Factory power bill. They include:\n \n1. The cooling capacity the PU is capable of producing after just seven (7) years in service. \n \n2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the PU is delivering as  \n \nreflected in the kW/ton measurement. \n \n3. The thermal dynamic ability of the equipment to still perform at or close to operational design.  \nMethodology\nThe measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the \nIPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework.\n \n[Client Director of Engineering] of Beverage Company and [Client Mechanical Engineer] of HVAC Contractor B witnessed and verified the recording of all of the \npilot measurements while being observed by Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer].\n  \nThe baseline day chosen to test the PU’s was an average day temperature and humidity-wise for the local \narea in the fall and winter which ensured repeatability of similar weather for the post testing measurements.  \nThe weather and factory conditions on both days provided an adequate heat load on the facility to ensure both \ncompressors in the system would remain running during the actual data collection period.

This same pilot PU was determined to be performing at an average of \n43% of the original design efficiency in the baseline. The actual design rated tonnage of the PU is 20 tons. In \nactuality, the PU was only producing a total of 8.4 tons of cooling at the start of the pilot. Approximately half of \nthis 57% efficiency loss is directly attributable to the thermal degradation of the heat exchange surfaces over a \nshort period of time. This is due in large part to thermal degradation which creates an insulating barrier to heat \ntransfer on the tube walls (inside the tube on a Direct Expansion system and outside the tube on a flooded \nevaporator chiller). The remaining efficiency loss is a result of the reduced inlet and outlet air ducting \nconfiguration used in conjunction with this and all the other PU’s in the factory. The actual airflow across the \ncoil in the PU is only about 50% of design so the focus of this in-situ pilot will be on the improvement delta \nover the baseline rather than against design.\nAfter the ECM was installed, the average efficiency in the PU increased to 54% of design specifications, \nequating to 10.8 total tons. The restoration of 2.4 tons represents a 28.6% increase in capacity.   \n \nCost to Beverage Company to Operate the Tea Factory HVAC PU Baseline vs Post\nThe degraded capacity described above prior to PermaFrost NMR® being implemented was costing the Tea \nFactory a similar amount in the way of wasted energy each hour the PU was operating.", "tokens": 799, "chars": 3532, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_103_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_103_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:42714c506434f9ce1321a88058edb021cb3ef48f9e9559a167564e4de3b33d28"}

The restoration of 2.4 tons represents a 28.6% increase in capacity.   \n \nCost to Beverage Company to Operate the Tea Factory HVAC PU Baseline vs Post\nThe degraded capacity described above prior to PermaFrost NMR® being implemented was costing the Tea \nFactory a similar amount in the way of wasted energy each hour the PU was operating. The average cost to \noperate the pilot PU as calculated in kW/ ton was 2.24 in the Baseline. When new, the kW/ton rating for units \nlike these usually ranges from .9 - 1.05 kW/ton when the proper sized ducting is used.\n \nThe restored average kW/ton rating following the ECM is now 1.77. This represents a 20.9% reduction in \nenergy costs from the baseline for every ton of cooling produced. This will result in an initial payback period \n(IPP) to the Tea Factory of approximately 22 months and an internal rate of Return (IRR) of 54.3%.
