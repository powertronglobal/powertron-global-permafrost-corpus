HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report
Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study
Thermal degradation is well documented by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air 
Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). It is a major cause of 
capacity loss in Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (HVACR) systems, preventing them 
from operating at the original design efficiency soon after initial installation in the field. 
The purpose of this study is to verify the effectiveness of the PermaFrost NMR® Energy Conservation Measure 
(ECM) in a water-cooled package unit at the Beverage Company/Beverage Company Beverage Company B Factory and document the future avoided 
energy costs associated with the same.

Process
This comprehensive report contains specific information regarding the performance profile of a single water 
cooled packaged unit (PU) that supports the Beverage Company B Factory. The detailed performance testing (outlined 
later in this report) was performed on the PU before (baseline) and after (post) the installation of PermaFrost 
NMR®. 
This testing determined the impact on three key elements relating to the original design specifications that 
greatly affect the HVAC portion of the Beverage Company B Factory power bill. They include:
 
1. The cooling capacity the PU is capable of producing after just seven (7) years in service. 
 
2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the PU is delivering as  
 
reflected in the kW/ton measurement. 
 
3. The thermal dynamic ability of the equipment to still perform at or close to operational design.  
Methodology
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the 
IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework.
 
[Client Director of Engineering] of Beverage Company and [Client Mechanical Engineer] of HVAC Contractor B witnessed and verified the recording of all of the 
pilot measurements while being observed by Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer].
  
The baseline day chosen to test the PU’s was an average day temperature and humidity-wise for the local 
area in the fall and winter which ensured repeatability of similar weather for the post testing measurements.  
The weather and factory conditions on both days provided an adequate heat load on the facility to ensure both 
compressors in the system would remain running during the actual data collection period. The boundary of 
the testing was the PU and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance calculations 
is very high.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content detailed in the first phase of this report will first demonstrate the ability of the pilot PU to perform 
prior to the ECM being installed, as well as illustrate the amount of thermal degradation due in large part to 
thermal degradation within the heat exchangers. 
Following a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to determine the operational condition of the 
system was satisfactory, Baseline M&V data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. Approximately 3 
months after installation of PermaFrost NMR®, the M&V team returned on a very similar weather day to the 
Baseline to take Post M&V measurements in the identical fashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these 
measurements and associated calculations show the amount of capacity restored.
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• Ton = (Airflow * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta) / 12,000 
 
• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)

HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Calculated Eﬃciency of Tea Factory HVAC PU Baseline and Post
The measurements taken show just how far off design the Tea Factory pilot PU (#79) had degraded in terms 
of efficiency over seven (7) years of use. This same pilot PU was determined to be performing at an average of 
43% of the original design efficiency in the baseline. The actual design rated tonnage of the PU is 20 tons. In 
actuality, the PU was only producing a total of 8.4 tons of cooling at the start of the pilot. Approximately half of 
this 57% efficiency loss is directly attributable to the thermal degradation of the heat exchange surfaces over a 
short period of time. This is due in large part to thermal degradation which creates an insulating barrier to heat 
transfer on the tube walls (inside the tube on a Direct Expansion system and outside the tube on a flooded 
evaporator chiller). The remaining efficiency loss is a result of the reduced inlet and outlet air ducting 
configuration used in conjunction with this and all the other PU’s in the factory. The actual airflow across the 
coil in the PU is only about 50% of design so the focus of this in-situ pilot will be on the improvement delta 
over the baseline rather than against design.
After the ECM was installed, the average efficiency in the PU increased to 54% of design specifications, 
equating to 10.8 total tons. The restoration of 2.4 tons represents a 28.6% increase in capacity.   
 
Cost to Beverage Company to Operate the Tea Factory HVAC PU Baseline vs Post
The degraded capacity described above prior to PermaFrost NMR® being implemented was costing the Tea 
Factory a similar amount in the way of wasted energy each hour the PU was operating. The average cost to 
operate the pilot PU as calculated in kW/ ton was 2.24 in the Baseline. When new, the kW/ton rating for units 
like these usually ranges from .9 - 1.05 kW/ton when the proper sized ducting is used.
 
The restored average kW/ton rating following the ECM is now 1.77. This represents a 20.9% reduction in 
energy costs from the baseline for every ton of cooling produced. This will result in an initial payback period 
(IPP) to the Tea Factory of approximately 22 months and an internal rate of Return (IRR) of 54.3%. Extrapolated 
out over just the next five (5) years, this ECM project will net the Tea Factory a substantial ROI of 272% on their 
investment. These accumulated savings will greatly reduce the eventual CapEx costs to replace the PU’s when 
they finally reach the end of their useful life.

Recovered Wasted Energy with PermaFrost NMR®
The chart to the right illustrates the performance
restoration PermaFrost NMR® created in the treated PU. 
The average cost to operate this PU before 
it was treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as 
calculated in kW/ton, was 2.24.
The specific cost to operate this PU after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated 
in kW/ton, is currently 1.77.
After factoring in the amount of loss in this system due to improperly sized ducting, the baseline kW/ton 
ratings measured in-situ were expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of performance efficiency and 
cost to operate estimations for seven (7) year old equipment. The post results are also in line with the 
average improvement savings shown over more than 120,000 installations globally.   
Cost Savings for Tea Factory when Implementing ECM in all 13 HVAC PU’s
The Beverage Company B Factory packaging area has a total 188 tons of HVAC. The amount of ECM required to treat 
this facility was 188 ounces. At a cost to treat all 13 PU’s of $37,600, the Internal Rate of Return to Beverage Company is 
54.3% or a 22 month Initial Payback Period.

Return On Investment
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the Tea Factory PU.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Adjusted Baseline Tonnage: 10.8 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: 2.24 kW/ton * 10.8 tons = 24.19 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 24.19 kW * 4,080 Annual Operating Hrs = 98,695 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 98,695 kWh * $.105 = $10,363
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: .1.77 kW/ton * 10.8 tons = 19.12 kW
Annual kWh Post: 19.12 kW * 4,080 hours = 78,010 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 78,010 kWh * .105 cents = $8,191
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $10,363 - $8,191 = $2,172
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $2,172 / 12 = $181
Return On Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot PU: $4,000
Estimated Initial Payback Period for Tea Factory on the PU: $4,000 / $181 = 22 months
Total kWh saved by treating this PU = 20,685
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period 
for the Tea Factory for implementing the PermaFrost NMR®, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the 
true energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh 
expended in the Avoided Energy Reporting (Post) Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run 
the systems was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available 
tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the 
PermaFrostNMR® was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the 
reduced number of hours the systems will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the 
systems to reach the internal building set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand 
loading.

Notes
This pilot PU provides cooling to the 1st floor 
packaging floor of the Tea Factory.  It is estimated the 
PU runs approximately 4,080 hours annually prior to 
the ECM being implemented. 
Incoming CDW in the Post was 2 degrees warmer equating to 2.6%. This requires 
the Post amps to be reduced by this same 2.6% * 70%. The 70% accounts for the 
removal of fans running to which the ECM does not directly effect.

The Beverage Company B Factory is Saving More than just Energy
By treating all 13 of the Tea Factory PU’s with PermaFrost NMR® and based on the current manner in which 
the Tea Factory operates these PU’s, the company will save approximately 268,905 kWh per year and all the 
costs associated with those savings. From an environmental impact standpoint, the Tea Factory is also 
benefitting the surrounding community. Imagine how great the environmental impact will be when Beverage Company / 
Beverage Company moves forward with treating all their HVAC equipment across South Africa.
The 268,905 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 185 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from 
being released or any of the following: 
Annual greenhouse emissions from:
