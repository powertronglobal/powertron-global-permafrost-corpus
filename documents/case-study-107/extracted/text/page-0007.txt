Recovered Wasted Energy with PermaFrost NMR®
The chart to the right illustrates the performance
restoration PermaFrost NMR® created in the treated PU. 
The average cost to operate this PU before 
it was treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as 
calculated in kW/ton, was 2.24.
The specific cost to operate this PU after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated 
in kW/ton, is currently 1.77.
After factoring in the amount of loss in this system due to improperly sized ducting, the baseline kW/ton 
ratings measured in-situ were expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of performance efficiency and 
cost to operate estimations for seven (7) year old equipment. The post results are also in line with the 
average improvement savings shown over more than 120,000 installations globally.
