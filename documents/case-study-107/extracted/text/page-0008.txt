The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the Tea Factory PU.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Adjusted Baseline Tonnage: 10.8 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: 2.24 kW/ton * 10.8 tons = 24.19 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 24.19 kW * 4,080 Annual Operating Hrs = 98,695 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 98,695 kWh * $.105 = $10,363
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: .1.77 kW/ton * 10.8 tons = 19.12 kW
Annual kWh Post: 19.12 kW * 4,080 hours = 78,010 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 78,010 kWh * .105 cents = $8,191
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $10,363 - $8,191 = $2,172
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $2,172 / 12 = $181
Return On Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot PU: $4,000
Estimated Initial Payback Period for Tea Factory on the PU: $4,000 / $181 = 22 months
Total kWh saved by treating this PU = 20,685
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period 
for the Tea Factory for implementing the PermaFrost NMR®, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the 
true energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh 
expended in the Avoided Energy Reporting (Post) Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run 
the systems was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available 
tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the 
PermaFrostNMR® was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the 
reduced number of hours the systems will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the 
systems to reach the internal building set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand 
loading.
