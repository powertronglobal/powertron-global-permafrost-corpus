Notes
This pilot PU provides cooling to the 1st floor 
packaging floor of the Tea Factory.  It is estimated the 
PU runs approximately 4,080 hours annually prior to 
the ECM being implemented. 
Incoming CDW in the Post was 2 degrees warmer equating to 2.6%. This requires 
the Post amps to be reduced by this same 2.6% * 70%. The 70% accounts for the 
removal of fans running to which the ECM does not directly effect.
