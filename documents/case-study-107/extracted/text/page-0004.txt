Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content detailed in the first phase of this report will first demonstrate the ability of the pilot PU to perform 
prior to the ECM being installed, as well as illustrate the amount of thermal degradation due in large part to 
thermal degradation within the heat exchangers. 
Following a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to determine the operational condition of the 
system was satisfactory, Baseline M&V data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. Approximately 3 
months after installation of PermaFrost NMR®, the M&V team returned on a very similar weather day to the 
Baseline to take Post M&V measurements in the identical fashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these 
measurements and associated calculations show the amount of capacity restored.
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• Ton = (Airflow * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta) / 12,000 
 
• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
