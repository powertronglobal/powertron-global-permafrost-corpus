HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report
Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study
Thermal degradation is well documented by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air 
Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). It is a major cause of 
capacity loss in Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (HVACR) systems, preventing them 
from operating at the original design efficiency soon after initial installation in the field. 
The purpose of this study is to verify the effectiveness of the PermaFrost NMR® Energy Conservation Measure 
(ECM) in a water-cooled package unit at the Beverage Company/Beverage Company Beverage Company B Factory and document the future avoided 
energy costs associated with the same.

of the Beverage Company B Factory with the heavy duty industrial filters and 
front access panel removed before beginning testing. This PU was 
forensically tested using the IPMVP methodology to determine its 
performance capabilities after seven (7) years in the field.
