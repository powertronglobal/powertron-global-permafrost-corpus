HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Calculated Eﬃciency of National Restaurant Chain RTU’s Baseline and Post
The chart below illustrates how far off design the National Restaurant Chain RTU’s had degraded in terms of efficiency 
over 11 years of the coils being in use. The RTU’s were performing at an average of 75.5% of the original design 
efficiency when they were first treated with PermaFrost NMR®. The nominal design rated tonnage of each of 
RTU’s is 10 tons. In actuality however, each of the RTU’s was only producing an average of 7.22 tons at the start 
of the pilot. The majority of this 24.5% efficiency loss was directly attributable to the thermal degradation of the 
heat exchange surfaces. This is due in large part to thermal degradation creating an insulating barrier to heat transfer 
through the tube walls. 
After the ECM was installed, the average efficiency in the RTU’s unit jumped up to 98.2% of design 
specifications or 9.82 tons each. This represents a 30% improvement in efficiency over the baseline numbers.
