Notes
The pilot RTU’s provide cooling to the Kitchens 
in three of the four locations. The RTU at Philly 
Airport provides cooling to the Middle part of 
the restaurant. Given the usage of the facility 
and the weather in the mid-Atlantic region, it is 
estimated the RTU’s run approximately 3,000 
hours annually prior to PermaFrost NMR® 
installation.
