Sustainability 
 
 
Summary 
 
Most customers are voluntarily reducing their carbon footprint. Municipalities 
are starting to regulate GHG emission, require action and will fine operators 
who fail to meet specified targets by deadlines, e.g., see NYC through Local Law 
97. Regardless of motive, no one wants to waste 20%-30% of the energy 
drawn by HVAC and exacerbate climate change. Yet, every untreated HVAC 
unit does so. By 2050, HVAC will consume 25% of the world’s electricity (MIT 
Study link).  
 
Capacity Restoration Sustainability Impact 
 
PermaFrost NMR® returns degraded equipment to ~OEM design cooling 
efficiency. It permanently fixes the problem of oil migration. Restored cooling 
capacity results in cooler air, shorter time to reach thermostat set-point, 
reduced max peak energy draw and lower kWh usage. That’s good for the 
machine, better for the planet and best for the operator.  
 
The amount of decarbonization will depend on HVAC-intensity. Typical 
customers draw 35%-50% of their energy to support HVAC during cooling 
season. Given equivalent year/year workload, PermaFrost NMR® will reduce 
total energy usage up-to 10%. If an operator optimizes the equipment once 
capacity is restored, it will produce more energy savings. Depending on 
equipment available, further optimization of a treated system may be 
implemented to take advantage of the restored capacity.  
 
Below are basic sustainability facts and links to sample customer impact 
reports. 
Measuring Sustainability Impact 
 
• All HVAC systems operate by the same cooling principles 
• ASHRAE has confirmed all systems lose 20%-30% cooling efficiency
