• PermaFrost NMR® is a chemical process. Results of its molecular 
reaction are the same each time it is injected into a HVAC system 
• PermaFrost NMR® dislodges molecules affixed to metal surfaces that 
degrade cooling efficiency. This permanently returns the machine to 
~OEM design cooling capacity and efficiency 
• Once capacity is restored, every ton of air conditioned thereafter 
requires 20%-30% less energy than it did prior to treatment 
• Each machine’s exact capacity loss and degree of restoration can be 
measured before and after treatment 
• ASHRAE also provides numerous studies that accurately predict cooling 
capacity decline by unit/equipment type 
• Long term effect on GHG emission can be calculated by the percentage 
change in kW/ton or change in EER 
• Annual effect can be calculated by year/year kWh usage comparison but 
requires accounting for changes in workload and weather 
• kWh avoided or saved, are translated to amount of CO2 displaced using 
U.S. DOE guidelines
