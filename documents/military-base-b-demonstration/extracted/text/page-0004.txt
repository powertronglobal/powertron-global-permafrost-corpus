TAI-566 EMIP Demonstration, Military Base B
July 20 - 22, 2009
In this demonstration we treated a 
Carrier Transicold Supra 744 
refrigerated transport vehicle to show 
the benefits of PermaFrost®.
     Objective:
 
Powertron Global™ supplied a refrigerated vehicle for the demonstration of the PermaFrost® product line’s 
ability to reduce HVAC system kilowatt consumption by allowing the refrigerated unit to produce colder 
dryer air which results in reduced run-time.  Reducing run-time reduces the kilowatts (kwh) needed to run 
the refrigerated system.  Reducing the kwh required for operation reduces fuel necessary to run the generator 
and the vehicle.
 
The Demonstration was conducted over 2 days.  
The truck was allowed to run for 8 hours from 
0950 to 1750 and all measurements were recorded.  
Then we applied PermaFrost® technology to the 
refrigeration unit and measured it for the same 8 
hours the following day (0950 to 1750).
