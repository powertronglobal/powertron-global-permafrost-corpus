Reducing run-time reduces the kilowatts (kwh) needed to run \nthe refrigerated system.  Reducing the kwh required for operation reduces fuel necessary to run the generator \nand the vehicle.\n \nThe Demonstration was conducted over 2 days.  \nThe truck was allowed to run for 8 hours from \n0950 to 1750 and all measurements were recorded.  \nThen we applied PermaFrost® technology to the \nrefrigeration unit and measured it for the same 8 \nhours the following day (0950 to 1750).\n\n\n\n21-Jul\n20-Jul\n62\n64\n66\n68\n70\n72\n74\n76\n78\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\nTemperature\nHours\n2\n     Initial 4 hours\nThe container temperature was one degree higher for the Post compared to the Baseline.
