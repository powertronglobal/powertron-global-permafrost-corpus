u 
HVAC/R accounts for 50% of electricity consumption in buildings 
u 
6-10% of total building electric use is wasted due to HVAC efficiency loss  
u 
2.6 Trillion kWh’s are wasted annually 
u 
1.82 Billion Metric tons of CO2 are emitted annually due to HVAC waste 
u 
Annually 400 Billion dollars is wasted as a result of this efficiency loss 
1.  MARKET -  All In-Service Commercial HVAC and Refrigeration Systems. This is a 
trillion dollar market. 
2.  PROBLEM -  All HVAC loses substantial efficiency.  Most use 30-50% more power 
than expected and the industry has no valid solutions addressing the issue. 
“Making cooling more efficient would also yield multiple benefits, making it more affordable, more secure, and more sustainable, and 
saving as much as USD 2.9 trillion in investment, fuel and operating costs.” (International Energy Agency -May 2018)

We have the experience to identify 
efficiency gaps, the technology to restore 
it, and processes to maintain it. 
WHY WE ARE DIFFERENT 
Our ecosystem 
creates solutions in 
the gaps, because 
industry market  
segments operate in 
isolation.
