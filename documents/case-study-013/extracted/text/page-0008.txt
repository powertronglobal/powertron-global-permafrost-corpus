PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for Regional Water Utility
Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Regional Water Utility for 
implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This greater capacity reduces the runtime hours and in turn 
reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post. The true ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the units 
was when operating at their original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of tonnage and then 
subtracting the new cost to run the units at this same newly restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was 
installed. This regression calculation is the most scientific method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the 
units will now run due to their increased capacity which allows the units to reach set temperatures quicker and shut off 
sooner.
Adjusted kW Baseline        1.76 kW/ton * 62.5 tons =110 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh        110 kW * 4,389 Annual Operating hours = 482,790 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline        482,790 kWh * $.1055 = $50,934
kW Post         1.47 kW/ton * 62.5 tons = 91.9 kW
Annual kWh Post         91.9 kW * 4,389 hours = 403,349 kWh
Annual Cost Post         403,349 kWh * .1055 cents = $42,553
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Month       ($50,934 - $42,553)/12 = $698
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in pilot System        $13,500
Estimated Energy Savings Payback Period for Regional Water Utility on Chiller #2        $13,500/ $698 = 19.3 months
