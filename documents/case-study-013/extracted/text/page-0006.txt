This unit provides cooling for the customer service center. Based off of compressor runtimes recorded by 
onboard systems, it is estimated that this chiller runs ~4,389 hours per year prior to the ECM being 
implemented.
Baseline & AERP Measurements 
The identical IPMVP following data points were recorded for Baseline and Post on 9/27/13 and 11/1/13
