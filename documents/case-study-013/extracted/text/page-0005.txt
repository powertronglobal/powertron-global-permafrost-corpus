Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces.
 
A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the operational 
conditions of the systems were satisfactory. Baseline M&V was recorded and then the proper amount and 
type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected directly into the suction side of the refrigerant loop. The gestation 
period for the Regional Water Utility pilot was 4 weeks. At the end of this gestation period, Post M&V results were taken in 
the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same or very similar outside air 
temperatures and return chilled water temperatures to assure repetition within the test format therefore no 
weather adjustments or load adjustments were required.
The following report produces the utilization of the International Performance Measurement and 
Verification Protocol (IPMVP) as the M&V framework for calculations. Regional Water Utility’s Senior Engineer Jeff 
[Senior Engineer Ph.D. PE LEED GA], Senior Project Coordinator [Senior Project Coordinator], Engineering Dept.’s [Engineering Dept. Rep] 
PE PMP, Chief Engineer E.B. Sorrell Jr. PE TLS SECB, and Senior Research Engineer [Client Representative] PE all 
participated in this pilot. Powertron Global®’s Chief Science Officer and Forensic Mechanical Engineer, 
[Senior Energy Engineer] CSO, CMC, FME performed the final calculations.
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47(blended PF and Sq. Rt. of 3)/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage
 
 
Coeﬃcient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
 
 
Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU 
 
 
Refrigerant Approach = Supply Water Temp – Saturated Evaporator Temp (CH) or Supply Air  - 
 
Saturated Evaporator Temp (DX)
