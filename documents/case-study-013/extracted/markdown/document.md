PermaFrost NMR® Performance Report

Regional Water Utility

November, 2013

Executive Summary

This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure

(ECM) PermaFrost NMR® into one (1) air-cooled chiller located at 3600 1st Ave. North Southern City Facility A.

Detailed forensic performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on this unit owned by

Regional Water Utility (Regional Water Utility).  Following testing, the unit was treated with the proper amount

and type of the PermaFrost NMR® technology specially formulated for these types of systems.

Measurement and Verification (M&V) was conducted to establish an initial energy baseline and a post

avoided energy-reporting period. The purpose of the testing was to show how the ECM improves the

thermal performance of any system it is installed in.

The improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at the unit was solely attributable to

PermaFrost NMR® ECM. This is a result of the reversal of thermal inefficiency on the heat exchanger surfaces.

Following treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology and operating at 100% load amps, the chiller

showed an effective net average 16.5% reduction in kW/ton and an increase in capacity of 6.1%. The

operating tonnage grew from 58.9 tons to 62.5 tons. This capacity increase from the baseline performance

level resulted in an effective average increase in COP of 19.5%. All of these factors directly correlate to what

Regional Water Utility will realize in energy savings as they operate this chiller in the future under the same parameters.

Following treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, the refrigerant approach was also lowered

from 8.80°F to 8.45°F. This represents a 4% improvement in approach, which is another measureable way to

determine the thermodynamic enhancement brought about by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.

The result of the ECM improvements is an ROI to Regional Water Utility of 19.3 months. The tables of data used to

determine the financial payback are available for review at the end of this report.

Product Brief

PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure

(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative® (NMR™) technology as its core agent. A sustainable,

one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for at least 10 years in any

type of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and

equipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX);

chilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia

refrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The

equipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single

and multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.

The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® in any type of HVACR system are improved cooling

performance, increased capacity and improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to

achieve set point temperatures in a more rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods.

The indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment

include reduced run time, less kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life

cycle time and a reduced carbon footprint for Regional Water Utility.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol

The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) was utilized in the

development of this report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating,

Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization

(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation

methods and products.

There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They

are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is

defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM as the single source of

measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM affected

equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.

Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the

savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term

measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by

short-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations

using measurements of proxies of energy use.

The final computation follows the formula:

Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Avoided Energy Reporting Period

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content

The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the

effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces.

A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the operational

conditions of the systems were satisfactory. Baseline M&V was recorded and then the proper amount and

type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected directly into the suction side of the refrigerant loop. The gestation

period for the Regional Water Utility pilot was 4 weeks. At the end of this gestation period, Post M&V results were taken in

the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same or very similar outside air

temperatures and return chilled water temperatures to assure repetition within the test format therefore no

weather adjustments or load adjustments were required.

The following report produces the utilization of the International Performance Measurement and

Verification Protocol (IPMVP) as the M&V framework for calculations. Regional Water Utility’s Senior Engineer Jeff

[Senior Engineer Ph.D. PE LEED GA], Senior Project Coordinator [Senior Project Coordinator], Engineering Dept.’s [Engineering Dept. Rep]

PE PMP, Chief Engineer E.B. Sorrell Jr. PE TLS SECB, and Senior Research Engineer [Client Representative] PE all

participated in this pilot. Powertron Global®’s Chief Science Officer and Forensic Mechanical Engineer,

[Senior Energy Engineer] CSO, CMC, FME performed the final calculations.

The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:

kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47(blended PF and Sq. Rt. of 3)/1000 (for 3-Phase)

kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage

Coeﬃcient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)

Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU

Refrigerant Approach = Supply Water Temp – Saturated Evaporator Temp (CH) or Supply Air  -

Saturated Evaporator Temp (DX)

Baseline & AERP Measurements

The identical IPMVP following data points were recorded for Baseline and Post on 9/27/13 and 11/1/13

respectively using recently NIST traceable calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. The OAT in

the baseline and post periods were almost identical therefore no weather adjustments were necessary due to

the standard deviation +/- 2 degrees. The measurements are as follows:

PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for Regional Water Utility

Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Regional Water Utility for

implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy

savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This greater capacity reduces the runtime hours and in turn

reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post. The true ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the units

was when operating at their original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of tonnage and then

subtracting the new cost to run the units at this same newly restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was

installed. This regression calculation is the most scientific method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the

units will now run due to their increased capacity which allows the units to reach set temperatures quicker and shut off

sooner.

Adjusted kW Baseline        1.76 kW/ton * 62.5 tons =110 kW

Adjusted Baseline kWh        110 kW * 4,389 Annual Operating hours = 482,790 kWh

Revised Cost to Run Baseline        482,790 kWh * $.1055 = $50,934

kW Post         1.47 kW/ton * 62.5 tons = 91.9 kW

Annual kWh Post         91.9 kW * 4,389 hours = 403,349 kWh

Annual Cost Post         403,349 kWh * .1055 cents = $42,553

Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Month       ($50,934 - $42,553)/12 = $698

Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in pilot System        $13,500

Estimated Energy Savings Payback Period for Regional Water Utility on Chiller #2        $13,500/ $698 = 19.3 months
