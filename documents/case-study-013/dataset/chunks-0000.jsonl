Following testing, the unit was treated with the proper amount \nand type of the PermaFrost NMR® technology specially formulated for these types of systems.\nMeasurement and Verification (M&V) was conducted to establish an initial energy baseline and a post \navoided energy-reporting period. The purpose of the testing was to show how the ECM improves the \nthermal performance of any system it is installed in.\nThe improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at the unit was solely attributable to \nPermaFrost NMR® ECM. This is a result of the reversal of thermal inefficiency on the heat exchanger surfaces.\nFollowing treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology and operating at 100% load amps, the chiller \nshowed an effective net average 16.5% reduction in kW/ton and an increase in capacity of 6.1%. The \noperating tonnage grew from 58.9 tons to 62.5 tons. This capacity increase from the baseline performance \nlevel resulted in an effective average increase in COP of 19.5%. All of these factors directly correlate to what \nRegional Water Utility will realize in energy savings as they operate this chiller in the future under the same parameters.\nFollowing treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, the refrigerant approach was also lowered \nfrom 8.80°F to 8.45°F. This represents a 4% improvement in approach, which is another measureable way to \ndetermine the thermodynamic enhancement brought about by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.\nThe result of the ECM improvements is an ROI to Regional Water Utility of 19.3 months. The tables of data used to \ndetermine the financial payback are available for review at the end of this report.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 624, "chars": 2885, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_024_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:d5129a952bec9d11c25761e01567c71fbcef5e659a58770d00f7f8cf25b04f9a"}

A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for at least 10 years in any \ntype of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and \nequipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); \nchilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia \nrefrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The \nequipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single \nand multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® in any type of HVACR system are improved cooling \nperformance, increased capacity and improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to \nachieve set point temperatures in a more rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. \nThe indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment \ninclude reduced run time, less kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life \ncycle time and a reduced carbon footprint for Regional Water Utility.\nEnergy Science Division\nBOUNDARY LAYER\nOIL REMOVED\nBEFORE TREATMENT\nAFTER TREATMENT\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 452, "chars": 2148, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_024_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_024_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:68c509b208be7099b08daad40f8a3eb31bc480e5c28fedde34cf250b99a763c2"}

The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating, \nRefrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization \n(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation \nmethods and products.\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is \ndefined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM as the single source of \nmeasurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM affected \nequipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations \nusing measurements of proxies of energy use. \nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Avoided Energy Reporting Period\n+ - Routine adjustments / + - Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 428, "chars": 2148, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_024_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_024_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:f04f1f2745f553509a769bcd092caa5173f9581b1bbafa32e07a3ea102d4c861"}

Baseline M&V was recorded and then the proper amount and \ntype of PermaFrost NMR® was injected directly into the suction side of the refrigerant loop.

This greater capacity reduces the runtime hours and in turn \nreduces the annual kWh expended in the Post. The true ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the units \nwas when operating at their original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of tonnage and then \nsubtracting the new cost to run the units at this same newly restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was \ninstalled. This regression calculation is the most scientific method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the \nunits will now run due to their increased capacity which allows the units to reach set temperatures quicker and shut off \nsooner.\nAdjusted kW Baseline        1.76 kW/ton * 62.5 tons =110 kW\nAdjusted Baseline kWh        110 kW * 4,389 Annual Operating hours = 482,790 kWh\nRevised Cost to Run Baseline        482,790 kWh * $.1055 = $50,934\nkW Post         1.47 kW/ton * 62.5 tons = 91.9 kW\nAnnual kWh Post         91.9 kW * 4,389 hours = 403,349 kWh\nAnnual Cost Post         403,349 kWh * .1055 cents = $42,553\nAvoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Month       ($50,934 - $42,553)/12 = $698\nCost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in pilot System        $13,500\nEstimated Energy Savings Payback Period for Regional Water Utility on Chiller #2        $13,500/ $698 = 19.3 months\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\nEnergy Science Division\nRegional Water Utility Saving More Than Just Energy at 3600 1st Ave. North\nBy treating the chiller with PermaFrost NMR®, Regional Water Utility will save an estimated 79,441 kWh per year and all the \ncosts associated with those savings.
