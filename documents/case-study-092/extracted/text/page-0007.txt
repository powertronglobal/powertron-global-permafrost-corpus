measurement period.
Data Center Provider Avoided Energy Usage Analysis
Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken in accordance with IPMVP protocols 
to determine the avoided energy usage and the annualized Return on Investment (ROI) Data Center Provider will realize by 
implementing this ECM:
Baseline kW         2.33 kW/ton * 41.7 tons = 97.2 kW
Baseline Annual kWh         97.2 kW * 4,365 hours = 424,278 kWh
Baseline Annual Cost         424,278 kWh * .07 cents = $29,699
Regression Analysis is then used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Split System  
Adjusted Baseline Tonnage         78.3 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted kW Baseline         2.33 kW/ton * 78.3 tons = 182.4 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh         182.4 kW * 4,365 Annual Operating Hrs = 796,176 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline         796,176 kWh * $.07 = $55,732
kW Post         1.33kW/ton * 78.3 tons = 104 kW
Annual kWh Post         104 kW * 4,365 hours = 453,960 kWh
Annual Cost Post         453,960 kWh * $.07 = $31,777
