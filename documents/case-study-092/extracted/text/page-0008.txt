Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Month         ($55,732 - $31,777)/12 = $1,996
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed         $15,625 / $1,996 = 8 months
        Payback Period = 8 months
        1 Year Annualized ROI = 150%
        5 year Annualized ROI = 750%
Engineering Conclusions
Please note that the energy baseline period (Pre) and the avoided energy reporting period (Post) data was 
compiled when this system was operating at a verified reduction of fifty percent (50%) capacity due to 
reduced outdoor air temperature resulting in reduced facility available load.  Both Baseline and Post analysis 
reporting period energy measurements were repeated during the data gathering periods.
