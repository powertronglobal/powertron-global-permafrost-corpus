System Description / Design Characteristics
This RTU provides the primary comfort cooling to the main offices at the Data Center Provider Data Center facility in Sanston, 
VA. This RTU runs ~4,365 hours per year according to the weather bin data captured from that region showing 
number of hours temperature is 60 degrees (15.6 ºC) and above. 
Baseline and Post Measurements
The identical IPMVP following data points were recorded for Baseline and Post on 10/11/12 and 4/29/13 
respectively using recently NIST calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. The Return Air entering 
the coil was very similar in both periods. Additionally, the discharge pressures of the compressors in both 
periods were very similar so no adjustments were made to the calculations. The measurements are as follows:
