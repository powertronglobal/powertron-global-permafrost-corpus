Detailed forensic performance \ntesting (outlined later in this report) was performed on a nominal 132.8 ton (476 kWR) packaged RTU \noutfitted with four compressors (two 30-HP compressors and two 35-HP compressors) using R22 refrigerant. \nFollowing testing, the RTU was treated with the proper amount and type of the PermaFrost NMR® \ntechnology specially formulated for these types of systems.  Measurement and Verification (M&V) was \nconducted pre-installation and post-gestation.\n \nThe improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly \nat the system was solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. \nThis is a result of the reversal of thermal inefficiency on heat exchange surfaces, \ncreating greater efficiency in refrigerant approach and the thermal\nenergy transfer abilities of the cooler and condenser vessels. \nFollowing treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, the system showed an effective net 42.9% \nreduction in kW/ton based on the exact capacity measured in the baseline M&V and the post gestation \nM&V. With two of the four 31-ton (109 kWR) compressors operating at full load, the system showed a slight \n7.2% increase in kW consumption while simultaneously producing an increase in capacity of 36.6 tons (126 \nkWR). This 88.2% increase from the baseline performance levels produced an effective in system efficiency of \n87.7%, which directly correlates to what Data Center Provider will realize in energy savings as they operate the system in the \nfuture under the same parameters. \nFollowing treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, the system also showed a substantial \nimprovement in Enthalpy Delta, which is a critical HVAC measurement used to determine the thermodynamic \nenhancement brought about by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result of the ECM improvement is an ROI to \nData Center Provider that is measured in months. The tables of data are available for review at the end of this report. Financial \ncalculations determining the true ROI are proprietary to Data Center Provider under separate cover.  \nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 731, "chars": 3316, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_089_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:7bea6493d0d36c180fe3f05c6fc7350dd548e4eaf0ae805e64b9314562ba2a0c"}

A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any \ntype of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and \nequipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); \nchilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia \nrefrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The \nequipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single \nand multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and \nimproved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point temperatures in a more \nrapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from the \nenhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW hours \nused, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced carbon footprint \nfor Data Center Provider.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 428, "chars": 2101, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_089_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_089_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:ff28e45931866e23f767b1294b65668ff2bba490862199fe275d3faafc829899"}

The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating, \nRefrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization \n(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation \nmethods and products.\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is \ndefined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single \nsource of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM \naffected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period. For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations \nusing measurements of proxies of energy use. \nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+/ - Routine Adjustments +/ - Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 434, "chars": 2152, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_089_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_089_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:f2b57ed1b0927cf50cbc4cac99a99176b2e897ed0e141dbbd8640ad2f1d0e03a"}

Baseline M&V were recorded and then the proper amount and type of \nPermaFrost NMR® was injected. The gestation period for the Data Center Provider pilot was six (6) months on this particular \nRTU to allow it to achieve the required ~300 hours of runtime. At the end of this gestation period, Post \nM&V results were taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same or \nvery similar entering air temperatures and compressor discharge pressures. These are the two most critical \nmeasurements affected by the weather. When analyzing the data, no adjustments for weather were \nnecessary. \nThe following report produces the utilization of the International Performance Measurement and \nVerification Protocol (IPMVP) as the M&V plan. Charles Tedesco, Monsen Engineering, a Test and Balance \nCertified Professional developed these results under the guidelines of the International Performance \nMeasurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP), Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors of America \n(SMACNA), and The Associated Air Balance Council (AABC). The final calculations were performed by \nPowertron Global’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer].  \nThe results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:\n \nkW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase)   \n \nBTUH = CFM * 4.5 (standard air) * Calculated Enthalpy Delta\n \nkW / Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage or kWR\n \nPercentage Eﬃciency = Measured BTUh / Manufacturers Design BTUh\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 529, "chars": 2469, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_089_chunk_0003", "next_id": "pdf_089_chunk_0005", "content_hash": "sha256:1e2e7bb48c6ab8a9e0902aca8f8fee1bf46b2894e3fe245c34d95bf090a3d5ae"}
