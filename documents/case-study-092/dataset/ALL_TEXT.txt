PermaFrost NMR® Eﬃciency Report
Data Center Provider Data Center Group
May, 2013
Executive Summary
         This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure (ECM) 
PermaFrost NMR® in the primary HVAC Roof Top Unit (RTU) serving the main offices at the Data Center Provider Data 
Center Facilities located at 6000 Technology Blvd, Sanston (Richmond), VA. Detailed forensic performance 
testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on a nominal 132.8 ton (476 kWR) packaged RTU 
outfitted with four compressors (two 30-HP compressors and two 35-HP compressors) using R22 refrigerant. 
Following testing, the RTU was treated with the proper amount and type of the PermaFrost NMR® 
technology specially formulated for these types of systems.  Measurement and Verification (M&V) was 
conducted pre-installation and post-gestation.
 
The improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly 
at the system was solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. 
This is a result of the reversal of thermal inefficiency on heat exchange surfaces, 
creating greater efficiency in refrigerant approach and the thermal
energy transfer abilities of the cooler and condenser vessels. 
Following treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, the system showed an effective net 42.9% 
reduction in kW/ton based on the exact capacity measured in the baseline M&V and the post gestation 
M&V. With two of the four 31-ton (109 kWR) compressors operating at full load, the system showed a slight 
7.2% increase in kW consumption while simultaneously producing an increase in capacity of 36.6 tons (126 
kWR). This 88.2% increase from the baseline performance levels produced an effective in system efficiency of 
87.7%, which directly correlates to what Data Center Provider will realize in energy savings as they operate the system in the 
future under the same parameters. 
Following treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, the system also showed a substantial 
improvement in Enthalpy Delta, which is a critical HVAC measurement used to determine the thermodynamic 
enhancement brought about by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result of the ECM improvement is an ROI to 
Data Center Provider that is measured in months. The tables of data are available for review at the end of this report. Financial 
calculations determining the true ROI are proprietary to Data Center Provider under separate cover.

Product Brief
         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure 
(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, 
one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any 
type of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and 
equipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); 
chilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia 
refrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The 
equipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single 
and multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and 
improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point temperatures in a more 
rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from the 
enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW hours 
used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced carbon footprint 
for Data Center Provider.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) was utilized in the 
development of this report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating, 
Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization 
(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation 
methods and products.
There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They 
are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is 
defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single 
source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM 
affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period. For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term 
measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by 
short-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations 
using measurements of proxies of energy use. 
The final computation follows the formula:
Energy Science Division
Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy
+/ - Routine Adjustments +/ - Non-Routine Adjustments

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces. 
A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the unit’s operational 
conditions were satisfactory. Baseline M&V were recorded and then the proper amount and type of 
PermaFrost NMR® was injected. The gestation period for the Data Center Provider pilot was six (6) months on this particular 
RTU to allow it to achieve the required ~300 hours of runtime. At the end of this gestation period, Post 
M&V results were taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same or 
very similar entering air temperatures and compressor discharge pressures. These are the two most critical 
measurements affected by the weather. When analyzing the data, no adjustments for weather were 
necessary. 
The following report produces the utilization of the International Performance Measurement and 
Verification Protocol (IPMVP) as the M&V plan. Charles Tedesco, Monsen Engineering, a Test and Balance 
Certified Professional developed these results under the guidelines of the International Performance 
Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP), Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors of America 
(SMACNA), and The Associated Air Balance Council (AABC). The final calculations were performed by 
Powertron Global’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer].  
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase)   
 
BTUH = CFM * 4.5 (standard air) * Calculated Enthalpy Delta
 
kW / Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage or kWR
 
Percentage Eﬃciency = Measured BTUh / Manufacturers Design BTUh

Results
The following are the final calculated performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® Post 
measurement period.
Data Center Provider Avoided Energy Usage Analysis
Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken in accordance with IPMVP protocols 
to determine the avoided energy usage and the annualized Return on Investment (ROI) Data Center Provider will realize by 
implementing this ECM:
Baseline kW         2.33 kW/ton * 41.7 tons = 97.2 kW
Baseline Annual kWh         97.2 kW * 4,365 hours = 424,278 kWh
Baseline Annual Cost         424,278 kWh * .07 cents = $29,699
Regression Analysis is then used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Split System  
Adjusted Baseline Tonnage         78.3 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted kW Baseline         2.33 kW/ton * 78.3 tons = 182.4 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh         182.4 kW * 4,365 Annual Operating Hrs = 796,176 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline         796,176 kWh * $.07 = $55,732
kW Post         1.33kW/ton * 78.3 tons = 104 kW
Annual kWh Post         104 kW * 4,365 hours = 453,960 kWh
Annual Cost Post         453,960 kWh * $.07 = $31,777

Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Month         ($55,732 - $31,777)/12 = $1,996
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed         $15,625 / $1,996 = 8 months
        Payback Period = 8 months
        1 Year Annualized ROI = 150%
        5 year Annualized ROI = 750%
Engineering Conclusions
Please note that the energy baseline period (Pre) and the avoided energy reporting period (Post) data was 
compiled when this system was operating at a verified reduction of fifty percent (50%) capacity due to 
reduced outdoor air temperature resulting in reduced facility available load.  Both Baseline and Post analysis 
reporting period energy measurements were repeated during the data gathering periods.
