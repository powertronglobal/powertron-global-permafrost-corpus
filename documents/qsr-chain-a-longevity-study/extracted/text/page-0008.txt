Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content within this report demonstrates the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to reverse the effects of oil 
migration and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces, restoring their efficiency to near original design 
specifications. 
Prior to installing the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR®, the pilot equipment was inspected to 
determine if it was in satisfactory operational condition. In every store, the technology was then allowed at 
least three weeks to “seat” into the crystal lattice of the metal surfaces before the post kWh usage was 
compared to the baseline readings to establish the efficiency gains. 
Below are photos of some of the QSR Chain A’s HVACR units involved in the pilot. They help to demonstrate that 
the PermaFrost NMR® technologies are safe and effective in all types of units and refrigerant types.
