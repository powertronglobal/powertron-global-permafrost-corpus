Product Brief
         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry ECM that uses Nucleo 
Molecular Regenerative® (NMR™) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, one-time treatment with 
no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type of system in which it 
is installed – DX (direct expansion air and chilled water systems), chillers (screw, reciprocating, scroll 
and centrifugal), heat pumps, ice making equipment. Specialized applications include computer room 
cooling and dehumidification systems, chiller plants (water and ice production applications), domestic 
and industrial refrigeration (ammonia low and ultra-low temperature), air-cooled single application 
water chillers and split and package rooftop HVAC equipment.
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and 
improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allows a system to achieve set point temperatures in a more 
rapid fashion which reduces system loading and operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from 
the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW 
hours used, less amp draw at the compressor per ton, less metallic wear, longer overall equipment life 
and a reduced carbon footprint for QSR Chain A’s.

Overview of Energy Study
        In May 2013, Powertron Global® concluded a two-year, two-part energy study documenting the 
long-term effects of PermaFrost NMR® into the climate control systems (HVACR) inside 10 QSR Chain A’s stores. 
The stores chosen for the study were all located in the mid-Atlantic region because this area most accurately 
represents the operational and energy mean average for all QSR Chain A’s stores in United States. The study was 
conducted under the guidance of [Senior Energy Director, P.E. MBA], Senior Energy Director, Quality Supply 
Chain Co-op, Inc.
In the summer of 2011, the technology was installed in 24 packaged roof top units (RTUs) and 20 
refrigeration units supporting the 10 stores. The RTUs comprising this pilot project ranged in size from 5 to 
15-tons and involved various models from several different manufacturers. The refrigeration units were all 1 
to 1½ ton systems common to most QSR Chain A’s store configurations. The refrigerants involved included R22 
(mineral-based) and R404A and R410A (synthetic-based). Based on national weather BIN data for the 
Baltimore/Annapolis/Washington areas for all the hours per year over 60 degrees, the RTUs operate 
approximately 3,896 hours each year. The refrigeration units operate nearly twice that amount of time.
Each part of the study had one primary objective.
1     Phase I determined the efficiency improvements directly at the unit. Scientific testing was 
conducted on a 10% sampling of the systems treated two years earlier to determine their current 
operating efficiency. The International Performance Measurement & Verification Protocol (IPMVP) 
was followed in collecting the performance data. The results, as shown later in this study, verified that 
the four units tested (averaging 5.5 years of age) were restored to (and are continuing to operate in a 
sustainable manner) or very near original design capacity. The units were also shown to be operating 
at or very near to their original kW/ton design. To quantify the expected efficiency loss and 
substantiate the findings, an untreated RTU (control group) installed in June of 2011 was also 
measured so its efficiency could be compared to the older treated units. The untreated 2-year old 
control group unit has already lost 13.7% off its original design specifications through thermal heat 
transfer degradation.

2     Phase II quantified the energy saving (kWh) benefits directly attributable to the PermaFrost 
NMR®.  Actual kWh consumed was analyzed and compared in the 10 QSR Chain A’s stores during the 
months of August and September of 2010 (pre-treatment) against the kWh consumed in the same two 
months of 2011 (post-treatment). The twenty months of power bill data from both the pre- and post- 
measurement periods shows a substantial 17.3% reduction in the amount of kWh's used. The number 
of Cooling Degree Days (CDDs) in these two months in 2010 and 2011 were nearly identical (732 in 
2010 vs. 730 in 2011) so no adjustments for weather were necessary. The original project involved four 
energy control measures (ECMs) installed as part of an energy savings initiative package; the 
predominant ECM during this time period being PermaFrost NMR®.
The chart on page 4 illustrates the 10 QSR Chain A’s stores showed an average 11.1% reduction in the kWh 
usage on the the power bills directly attributable to PermaFrost NMR® (i.e., treating RTU's, Walk-in 
Coolers & Freezers, Ice Machines) and a payback period of approximately 12 months. The two-year 
post measurements in Part I above support PermaFrost NMR® achieving its expected results in 
efficiency across the 44 HVAC/R units.

Phase I - Proven Sustainability
In Phase I of the study, the IPMVP scientific testing methodologies proved the efficiency improvements in 
2011 remain in 2013, two full years later. At the same time, the IPMVP testing data also shows how quickly 
new equipment in the control group loses efficiency.

Additional Validation of the Results
The chart below shows how the average efficiency gains directly at the HVACR units in each of the 10 
QSR Chain A’s stores aligns with the 11-year historical worldwide performance averages used by Con Edison in 
NYC to provide rebates for installing the PermaFrost NMR® technology. 
The 44 HVAC/R units supporting the 10 QSR Chain A’s locations in the pilot group all fell within the historical performance 
improvement ranges for the given age, averaging 16.3% reduction in energy usage directly at the unit level.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content within this report demonstrates the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to reverse the effects of oil 
migration and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces, restoring their efficiency to near original design 
specifications. 
Prior to installing the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR®, the pilot equipment was inspected to 
determine if it was in satisfactory operational condition. In every store, the technology was then allowed at 
least three weeks to “seat” into the crystal lattice of the metal surfaces before the post kWh usage was 
compared to the baseline readings to establish the efficiency gains. 
Below are photos of some of the QSR Chain A’s HVACR units involved in the pilot. They help to demonstrate that 
the PermaFrost NMR® technologies are safe and effective in all types of units and refrigerant types.
