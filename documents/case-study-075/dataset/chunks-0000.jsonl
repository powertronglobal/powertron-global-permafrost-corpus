Island Location A Arena (Island Location A Arena) has the problem of thermal \ndegradation in its entire inventory of HVAC/R equipment.\nEnergy savings from the energy conservation measure PermaFrost NMR® can be calculated based on this study \nand then accurately extrapolated across annual usage for this water-cooled chiller.\nIsland Location A Arena has a significant opportunity to reduce energy (kWh) waste, reduce the runtime of its HVAC/R inventory, \nand by doing so create a positive impact on our environment. PermaFrost NMR® is the leading sustainability \nenergy conservation measure in HVAC/R.\nThe improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at each HVAC/R equipment is solely \nattributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.\nThe in-situ energy study demonstrates:\n1. The ECM improving the performance of any system it is installed in.\n2.

Current btuh capacity of the equipment in service with the installed PermaFrost NMR® ECM.\n2.  Actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling the chiller is delivering as reflected in the \n     kW/ton measurement. \n3.  Mechanical soundness of the chiller and its ability to still perform at or close to operational design.\nFollowing testing, the chiller was treated with the proper amount and type of the PermaFrost NMR® \ntechnology specially formulated for this type of system.\nMethodology\nThe measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the \nIPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. NIST (National Institutes of \nStandards & Technology) calibrated devices where used for the highest level of accuracy and data integrity. \nIPMVP is the industry standard according to the US Department of Energy. Because of its wide international \nadoption, the IPMVP has been identified as the best Measurement and Verification (M&V) Framework for \nhelping to determine and secure financial compensation for emissions reductions resulting from Energy \nConservation Methods (ECM).\nM&V was conducted to establish an initial energy baseline and a post avoided energy-reporting period. The \npurpose of the testing was to show how the ECM improves the thermal performance of any system it is \ninstalled in.\nThe improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at each unit was solely attributable to \nPermaFrost NMR®. This is a result of the reversal of thermal inefficiency on the heat exchanger surfaces.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 548, "chars": 2637, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_077_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_077_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:89570e9ca990837faa833296064fc2c2143a0a59370373a4197eb852214de320"}

The high kW/ton ratings measured on site are in line with \nthe ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. The degraded chiller performance is costing \nIsland Location A Arena significant money and wasting energy. The chiller is using significantly more kWh to operate then it used \nwhen it was new. \nThe problem of thermal degradation affecting the chiller has been significantly corrected by installing the \nECM PermaFrost NMR®. The degraded chiller performance has been restored. The chiller is using significantly \nless kWh to operate than before the ECM was implemented. The efficiency summary combines the baseline, \npost tonnage and coefficient of performance (COP).

This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in the Avoided \nEnergy Reporting Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller was when \noperating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then \nsubtracting the revised cost to run the chiller at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was \ninstalled.
