HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report

The Purpose of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM

The purpose of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM is to correct the industry wide problem of efficiency loss in

HVAC/R that is present in your equipment. Island Location A Arena (Island Location A Arena) has the problem of thermal

degradation in its entire inventory of HVAC/R equipment.

Energy savings from the energy conservation measure PermaFrost NMR® can be calculated based on this study

and then accurately extrapolated across annual usage for this water-cooled chiller.

Island Location A Arena has a significant opportunity to reduce energy (kWh) waste, reduce the runtime of its HVAC/R inventory,

and by doing so create a positive impact on our environment. PermaFrost NMR® is the leading sustainability

energy conservation measure in HVAC/R.

The improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at each HVAC/R equipment is solely

attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.

The in-situ energy study demonstrates:

1. The ECM improving the performance of any system it is installed in.

2. The ECM is safe and will not harm Island Location A Arena HVAC/R equipment.

Process

This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure (ECM)

PermaFrost NMR® into one (1) Carrier water-cooled ice rink chiller located in Oak Bluffs, Island Location A,

MA.

Detailed forensic performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on this unit owned by Island Location A Arena

to determine three key elements that Island Location A Arena should be concerned with as they relate to the original design

specifications:

1.  Current btuh capacity of the equipment in service with the installed PermaFrost NMR® ECM.

2.  Actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling the chiller is delivering as reflected in the

kW/ton measurement.

3.  Mechanical soundness of the chiller and its ability to still perform at or close to operational design.

Following testing, the chiller was treated with the proper amount and type of the PermaFrost NMR®

technology specially formulated for this type of system.

Methodology

The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the

IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. NIST (National Institutes of

Standards & Technology) calibrated devices where used for the highest level of accuracy and data integrity.

IPMVP is the industry standard according to the US Department of Energy. Because of its wide international

adoption, the IPMVP has been identified as the best Measurement and Verification (M&V) Framework for

helping to determine and secure financial compensation for emissions reductions resulting from Energy

Conservation Methods (ECM).

M&V was conducted to establish an initial energy baseline and a post avoided energy-reporting period. The

purpose of the testing was to show how the ECM improves the thermal performance of any system it is

installed in.

The improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at each unit was solely attributable to

PermaFrost NMR®. This is a result of the reversal of thermal inefficiency on the heat exchanger surfaces.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)

The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the effects

of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces.

A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the operational conditions

of the systems were satisfactory. Baseline M&V was recorded on the unit and then the proper amount and

type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected directly into the suction side of the refrigerant loop. The gestation

period for the pilot was approximately nine (9) weeks. At the end of this gestation period, Post M&V results

were taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same outside air

temperatures.

The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:

• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase)

• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage

• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)

• Actual Cooling Tons/Hour = Evap GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU

HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results

The Island Location A Arena has the problem of thermal degradation. The high kW/ton ratings measured on site are in line with

the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. The degraded chiller performance is costing

Island Location A Arena significant money and wasting energy. The chiller is using significantly more kWh to operate then it used

when it was new.

The problem of thermal degradation affecting the chiller has been significantly corrected by installing the

ECM PermaFrost NMR®. The degraded chiller performance has been restored. The chiller is using significantly

less kWh to operate than before the ECM was implemented. The efficiency summary combines the baseline,

post tonnage and coefficient of performance (COP). This summary is the cumulative impact of the ECM’s

performance on the treated process chiller.

Recovered Wasted Energy with ECM -  Chiller

The chart to the right illustrates the performance

restoration the ECM created in the treated chiller.

The specific cost to operate this chiller before it has

been treated with PermaFrost NMR® as calculated in

kW/ton was .797.

The specific cost to operate this chiller after it has been

treated with PermaFrost NMR® as calculated in

kW/ton is currently .670.

The high kW/ton ratings measured on site are

expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of

performance and cost to operate estimations.

Cost to Island Location A Arena for Lost Eﬃciency

Left uncorrected, the chiller system with its reduced level of performance is costing (in money) an additional

22.6% or more than it would if it were running at the design specification. Extrapolated across the Island Location A Arena

inventory of chiller equipment, this adds up to a significant waste in money and energy resources.

Island Location A Arena was wasting over $8,679 a year by not correcting this problem in this ice rink chiller.

Return On Investment

The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR®

Post measurement period of the Island Location A Arena chiller.

Baseline Energy Consumption

Adjusted Baseline Tonnage: 89.2 tons

Adjusted kW Baseline: .797 kW/ton * 89.2 tons = 71.1 kW

Adjusted Baseline kWh: 71.1 kW * 4,800 Annual Operating Hrs = 341,280 kWh

Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 341,280 kWh * $.16 = $54,605

Post Energy Consumption

kW AERP: .67 kW/ton * 89.2 tons = 59.8 kW

Annual kWh ERP: 59.8 kW * 4,800 hours = 287,040 kWh

Annual Cost ERP: 287,040 kWh * .16 cents = $45,926

Savings Per Year

Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $54,605 - $45,926 = $8,679

Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $8,679 / 12 = $723.25

Return On Investment

Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in pilot System: $12,250

Estimated ROI Period for Island Location A Arena on Chiller: $12,250 / $723.25 = 16.9 months

Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Island Location A Arena for

implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy savings

resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in the Avoided

Energy Reporting Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller was when

operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then

subtracting the revised cost to run the chiller at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was

installed. This regression analysis is the most industry wide accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of

hours the chiller will now operate due to the restored capacity which allows the chiller to reach the chilled water set

point with increased efficiency that will result in reduced compressor demand loading.
