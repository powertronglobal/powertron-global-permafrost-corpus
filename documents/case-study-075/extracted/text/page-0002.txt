The Purpose of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM 
The purpose of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM is to correct the industry wide problem of efficiency loss in 
HVAC/R that is present in your equipment. Island Location A Arena (Island Location A Arena) has the problem of thermal 
degradation in its entire inventory of HVAC/R equipment.
Energy savings from the energy conservation measure PermaFrost NMR® can be calculated based on this study 
and then accurately extrapolated across annual usage for this water-cooled chiller.
Island Location A Arena has a significant opportunity to reduce energy (kWh) waste, reduce the runtime of its HVAC/R inventory, 
and by doing so create a positive impact on our environment. PermaFrost NMR® is the leading sustainability 
energy conservation measure in HVAC/R.
The improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at each HVAC/R equipment is solely 
attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.
The in-situ energy study demonstrates:
1. The ECM improving the performance of any system it is installed in.
2. The ECM is safe and will not harm Island Location A Arena HVAC/R equipment.
