Recovered Wasted Energy with ECM -  Chiller
The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration the ECM created in the treated chiller.
The specific cost to operate this chiller before it has 
been treated with PermaFrost NMR® as calculated in 
kW/ton was .797.
The specific cost to operate this chiller after it has been 
treated with PermaFrost NMR® as calculated in 
kW/ton is currently .670.
The high kW/ton ratings measured on site are 
expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance and cost to operate estimations.
