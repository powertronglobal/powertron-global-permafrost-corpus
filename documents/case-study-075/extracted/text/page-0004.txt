Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the effects 
of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces. 
 
A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the operational conditions 
of the systems were satisfactory. Baseline M&V was recorded on the unit and then the proper amount and 
type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected directly into the suction side of the refrigerant loop. The gestation 
period for the pilot was approximately nine (9) weeks. At the end of this gestation period, Post M&V results 
were taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same outside air 
temperatures.
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
• Actual Cooling Tons/Hour = Evap GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU
