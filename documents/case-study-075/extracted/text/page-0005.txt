HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
The Island Location A Arena has the problem of thermal degradation. The high kW/ton ratings measured on site are in line with 
the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. The degraded chiller performance is costing 
Island Location A Arena significant money and wasting energy. The chiller is using significantly more kWh to operate then it used 
when it was new. 
The problem of thermal degradation affecting the chiller has been significantly corrected by installing the 
ECM PermaFrost NMR®. The degraded chiller performance has been restored. The chiller is using significantly 
less kWh to operate than before the ECM was implemented. The efficiency summary combines the baseline, 
post tonnage and coefficient of performance (COP). This summary is the cumulative impact of the ECM’s 
performance on the treated process chiller.

• The chiller should be operating @ 90 tons of cooling capacity
• The chiller was operating @ 76.7 tons of cooling capacity prior to
   installing ECM
• The chiller now has 12.5 tons of restored cooling capacity after ECM
• The chiller should be operating @ 5.25 COP or greater 
• The chiller was operating @ 4.42 COP prior to the ECM
• The COP of the chiller was increased by 18.8% following
