Return On Investment
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period of the Island Location A Arena chiller. 
Baseline Energy Consumption
Adjusted Baseline Tonnage: 89.2 tons 
Adjusted kW Baseline: .797 kW/ton * 89.2 tons = 71.1 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 71.1 kW * 4,800 Annual Operating Hrs = 341,280 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 341,280 kWh * $.16 = $54,605
Post Energy Consumption
kW AERP: .67 kW/ton * 89.2 tons = 59.8 kW
Annual kWh ERP: 59.8 kW * 4,800 hours = 287,040 kWh
Annual Cost ERP: 287,040 kWh * .16 cents = $45,926
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $54,605 - $45,926 = $8,679
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $8,679 / 12 = $723.25
Return On Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in pilot System: $12,250
Estimated ROI Period for Island Location A Arena on Chiller: $12,250 / $723.25 = 16.9 months
Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Island Location A Arena for 
implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy savings 
resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in the Avoided 
Energy Reporting Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller was when 
operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then 
subtracting the revised cost to run the chiller at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was 
installed. This regression analysis is the most industry wide accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of 
hours the chiller will now operate due to the restored capacity which allows the chiller to reach the chilled water set 
point with increased efficiency that will result in reduced compressor demand loading.
