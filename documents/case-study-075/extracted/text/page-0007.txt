Cost to Island Location A Arena for Lost Eﬃciency
Left uncorrected, the chiller system with its reduced level of performance is costing (in money) an additional 
22.6% or more than it would if it were running at the design specification. Extrapolated across the Island Location A Arena 
inventory of chiller equipment, this adds up to a significant waste in money and energy resources.
Island Location A Arena was wasting over $8,679 a year by not correcting this problem in this ice rink chiller.
