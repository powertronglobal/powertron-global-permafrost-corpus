HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report

Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study

The purpose of this jointly-conducted ECM study between the Caribbean Telecom Provider and PTG engineering teams was threefold.

First, to verify the current capacity and efficiency of two 30-ton cooling units supporting critical Caribbean Telecom Provider operations

in relation to original equipment manufacturer (OEM) design specifications.  Second, to demonstrate what, if any,

material performance changes occur in these same cooling units after being treated with PermaFrost NMR® ECM.

And third, to determine what, if any, financial benefits are associated with any efficiency improvements realized.

The identification of cooling units involved in the study is recorded as follows:

• 30-ton Emerson/Liebert CRAC, Mfg date: 2012, R407C, 408 volt-3 Phase, Model DS105ASMOEI5OIA

• 30-ton Peake Split, Mfg date: 2007, HydroCarbon (HC), 408 volt-3 Phase, Model PCC360S3355TDM

ECM Product Brief

PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented surface science nanotechnology that uses Nucleo Molecular

Regenerative (NMR®) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, one-time treatment with no down time

required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type of climate control system in which it is

installed.  The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling efficiency and increased capacity,

both of which result in lower overall costs to operate a system and extended equipment life.

Methodology

After verifying the proper amount of air flowing across the evaporator coil before beginning the pilot, the

subsequent measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with

the IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework.

The results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic

engineering formulas:

• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase)

• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage

• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)

• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = (Measured CFM X 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta T) / 12,000 BTU

Recovered Wasted Energy with PermaFrost NMR® ECM

Like everyone in the world, Caribbean Telecom Provider has the problem of thermal degradation in their Chillers and HVAC

units. The degraded equipment performance is costing Caribbean Telecom Provider significant operational dollars through

wasted energy. The pilot cooling units were found to be using significantly more energy to operate than

when they were new.

The chart below illustrates the performance restoration

the ECM created in the treated units. The average

operational efficiency ratings of the units before being

treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in

kW/ton, were 1.34.

The average operational efficiency ratings of the units

after being treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated

in kW/ton, are currently 1.07.

The higher baseline kW/ton ratings measured

in-situ were expected when compared to the ASHRAE

predicted loss of operational performance efficiency

for similar age and type cooling units.

PermaFrost NMR® ECM into the pilot cooling units.

Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics

The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR®

Post measurement period for the Caribbean Telecom Provider cooling units.

Baseline Energy Consumption

Avg. Baseline Tonnage: 25.4 tons

Avg. Adjusted kW Baseline: 1.34 kW/ton * 32.4 tons = 43.4 kW

Avg. Adjusted Baseline kWh: 43.4 kW * 3,665 Annual Operating Hrs = 159,061 kWh

Avg. Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 159,061 kWh * $.26 = $41,356

Post Energy Consumption

kW Post: 1.07 kW/ton * 32.4 tons = 34.7 kW

Annual kWh Post: 34.7 kW * 3,665 hours = 127,176 kWh

Annual Cost Post: 127,176 kWh * $.26 cents = $33,066

Savings Per Year

Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $41,356 - $33,066 = $8,290

Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $8,290 / 12 = $691

Initial Payback Period

Cost of PermaFrost NMR®  installed in each 30-ton cooling units: $4,800

Estimated ROI Period for Caribbean Telecom Provider on each cooling unit: $4,800 / $691 = 7 Months

Annual Internal Rate of Return = 173%

Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 864%

Utilizing data collected during the pilot study, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for

Caribbean Telecom Provider for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy

savings resulting from the improvement in both capacity and efficiency. Working together, these improvements reduce the

annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the avg cooling

unit was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity

and then subtracting the revised cost to run the avg cooling unit at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR®

ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of

hours or load % the unit will now operate at due to the restored performance profile. This restored performance profile

allows the cooling unit to satisfy the internal area set point with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor

demand loading.

Caribbean Telecom Provider is Saving More than Just Energy

By treating just the two pilot 30-ton cooling units with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the manner in which the

pilot units are currently being operated, Caribbean Telecom Provider will save approximately 63,770 kWh per year and all the

costs associated with those savings. From an environmental impact standpoint, Caribbean Telecom Provider will also benefit all

the surrounding communities in which they operate.  Imagine the positive environmental impacts of treating

the rest of the Caribbean Telecom Provider portfolio of equipment spread across the equatorial regions of the world.

The 63,770 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 44 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from being

released or any of the following:

Annual greenhouse emissions from:
