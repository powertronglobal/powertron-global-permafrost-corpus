Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the Caribbean Telecom Provider cooling units.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Avg. Baseline Tonnage: 25.4 tons
Avg. Adjusted kW Baseline: 1.34 kW/ton * 32.4 tons = 43.4 kW
Avg. Adjusted Baseline kWh: 43.4 kW * 3,665 Annual Operating Hrs = 159,061 kWh
Avg. Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 159,061 kWh * $.26 = $41,356
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: 1.07 kW/ton * 32.4 tons = 34.7 kW
Annual kWh Post: 34.7 kW * 3,665 hours = 127,176 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 127,176 kWh * $.26 cents = $33,066
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $41,356 - $33,066 = $8,290
Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $8,290 / 12 = $691
Initial Payback Period
Cost of PermaFrost NMR®  installed in each 30-ton cooling units: $4,800
Estimated ROI Period for Caribbean Telecom Provider on each cooling unit: $4,800 / $691 = 7 Months
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 173%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 864%
Utilizing data collected during the pilot study, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for 
Caribbean Telecom Provider for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in both capacity and efficiency. Working together, these improvements reduce the 
annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the avg cooling 
unit was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity 
and then subtracting the revised cost to run the avg cooling unit at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® 
ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of 
hours or load % the unit will now operate at due to the restored performance profile. This restored performance profile 
allows the cooling unit to satisfy the internal area set point with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor 
demand loading.
