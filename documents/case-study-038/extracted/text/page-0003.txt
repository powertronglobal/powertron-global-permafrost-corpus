Recovered Wasted Energy with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Like everyone in the world, Caribbean Telecom Provider has the problem of thermal degradation in their Chillers and HVAC 
units. The degraded equipment performance is costing Caribbean Telecom Provider significant operational dollars through 
wasted energy. The pilot cooling units were found to be using significantly more energy to operate than 
when they were new.
The chart below illustrates the performance restoration 
the ECM created in the treated units. The average 
operational efficiency ratings of the units before being 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, were 1.34.
The average operational efficiency ratings of the units
after being treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated 
in kW/ton, are currently 1.07.
The higher baseline kW/ton ratings measured 
in-situ were expected when compared to the ASHRAE 
predicted loss of operational performance efficiency 
for similar age and type cooling units.  
Summary of Key Performance Measurements
