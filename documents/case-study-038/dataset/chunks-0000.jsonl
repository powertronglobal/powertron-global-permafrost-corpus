Second, to demonstrate what, if any, \nmaterial performance changes occur in these same cooling units after being treated with PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  \nAnd third, to determine what, if any, financial benefits are associated with any efficiency improvements realized.  \nThe identification of cooling units involved in the study is recorded as follows:\n \n• 30-ton Emerson/Liebert CRAC, Mfg date: 2012, R407C, 408 volt-3 Phase, Model DS105ASMOEI5OIA\n \n• 30-ton Peake Split, Mfg date: 2007, HydroCarbon (HC), 408 volt-3 Phase, Model PCC360S3355TDM\nECM Product Brief\nPermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented surface science nanotechnology that uses Nucleo Molecular \nRegenerative (NMR®) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, one-time treatment with no down time \nrequired, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type of climate control system in which it is \ninstalled.  The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling efficiency and increased capacity, \nboth of which result in lower overall costs to operate a system and extended equipment life. \nMethodology\nAfter verifying the proper amount of air flowing across the evaporator coil before beginning the pilot, the \nsubsequent measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with \nthe IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. \nThe results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic \nengineering formulas:\n \n• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) \n \n• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage \n \n• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)\n \n• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = (Measured CFM X 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta T) / 12,000 BTU\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval.", "tokens": 803, "chars": 3461, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_040_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:80e19130b7789e93723cfd01145ed6bf667fec7a28ec6aaf4150f1c63f2582b3"}

The degraded equipment performance is costing Caribbean Telecom Provider significant operational dollars through \nwasted energy. The pilot cooling units were found to be using significantly more energy to operate than \nwhen they were new.\nThe chart below illustrates the performance restoration \nthe ECM created in the treated units. The average \noperational efficiency ratings of the units before being \ntreated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in \nkW/ton, were 1.34.\nThe average operational efficiency ratings of the units\nafter being treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated \nin kW/ton, are currently 1.07.\nThe higher baseline kW/ton ratings measured \nin-situ were expected when compared to the ASHRAE \npredicted loss of operational performance efficiency \nfor similar age and type cooling units.  \nSummary of Key Performance Measurements\nThe table below summarizes the substantial improvements resulting from the implementation of the \nPermaFrost NMR® ECM into the pilot cooling units. \n0.0\n0.3\n0.6\n0.9\n1.2\n1.5\nReduction in\nPer Unit Costs\nEquating to a\n20.1% reduction\nCost Per Cooling Unit to Operate\nkW/ton\n.27 kW/ton\nBaseline\nPost ECM\n1.34\n1.07\nTYPE OF MEASUREMENT\nBASELINE\n1.34\n25.4\n4.81\n2.64\n159,061\n$41,356 \nPOST\n1.07\n32.4\n5.77\n3.33\n127,176\n$33,066 \nRESULTS\n20.5% Reduction\n27.6% Increase\n20% Increase\n26.1% Increase\n31,885 Annual kWh Savings \n$8,290 Annual Energy Cost Savings\nkW/Ton\nCapacity in Tons\nEnthalpy Delta\nCoeﬃcient of Performance\nAnnual KWh Usage \nEstimated Cost to Operate\nThe full complement of detailed and witnessed measurements are on file with Caribbean Telecom Provider’s Engineering Department\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 633, "chars": 2506, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_040_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_040_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:1fdcf05202494c152561012ff8c3fcd0e3a74b80ae3d098719f6dacb9e03524c"}

Baseline Tonnage: 25.4 tons\nAvg. Adjusted kW Baseline: 1.34 kW/ton * 32.4 tons = 43.4 kW\nAvg. Adjusted Baseline kWh: 43.4 kW * 3,665 Annual Operating Hrs = 159,061 kWh\nAvg. Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 159,061 kWh * $.26 = $41,356\nPost Energy Consumption\nkW Post: 1.07 kW/ton * 32.4 tons = 34.7 kW\nAnnual kWh Post: 34.7 kW * 3,665 hours = 127,176 kWh\nAnnual Cost Post: 127,176 kWh * $.26 cents = $33,066\nSavings Per Year\nAvoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $41,356 - $33,066 = $8,290\nEstimated Energy Savings per Month: $8,290 / 12 = $691\nInitial Payback Period\nCost of PermaFrost NMR®  installed in each 30-ton cooling units: $4,800\nEstimated ROI Period for Caribbean Telecom Provider on each cooling unit: $4,800 / $691 = 7 Months\nAnnual Internal Rate of Return = 173%\nReturn on Investment Over 5 Years = 864%\nUtilizing data collected during the pilot study, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for \nCaribbean Telecom Provider for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy \nsavings resulting from the improvement in both capacity and efficiency. Working together, these improvements reduce the \nannual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the avg cooling \nunit was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity \nand then subtracting the revised cost to run the avg cooling unit at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® \nECM was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of \nhours or load % the unit will now operate at due to the restored performance profile. This restored performance profile \nallows the cooling unit to satisfy the internal area set point with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor \ndemand loading.\n3\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\n®\n9.3 \nPassenger vehicles\n2.3\nGarbage trucks of waste sent to\nthe landﬁll instead of recycled\n4,948\nGallons of gasoline\nconsumed\n47,232\nPounds of coal burned\nannually\n102\nBarrels of oil\nconsumed\n6\nHomes’ electricity use for\none year\n4\nCaribbean Telecom Provider is Saving More than Just Energy\nBy treating just the two pilot 30-ton cooling units with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the manner in which the \npilot units are currently being operated, Caribbean Telecom Provider will save approximately 63,770 kWh per year and all the \ncosts associated with those savings.
