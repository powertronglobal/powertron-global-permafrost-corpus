SECTION 4
FIRST AID MEASURES
INHALATION
Remove from further exposure.  For those providing assistance, avoid exposure to yourself or 
others.  Use adequate respiratory protection.  If respiratory irritation, dizziness, nausea, or 
unconsciousness occurs, seek immediate medical assistance.  If breathing has stopped, assist 
ventilation with a mechanical device or use mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. 
SKIN CONTACT
Wash contact areas with soap and water.  If product is injected into or under the skin, or into any 
part of the body, regardless of the appearance of the wound or its size, the individual should be 
evaluated immediately by a physician as a surgical emergency. Even though initial symptoms 
from high pressure injection may be minimal or absent, early surgical treatment within the first few 
hours may significantly reduce the ultimate extent of injury. 
EYE CONTACT
Flush thoroughly with water.  If irritation occurs, get medical assistance. 
INGESTION
First aid is normally not required. Seek medical attention if discomfort occurs.
