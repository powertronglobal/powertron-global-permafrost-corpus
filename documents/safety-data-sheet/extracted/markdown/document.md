SECTION 4
FIRST AID MEASURES
INHALATION
Remove from further exposure.  For those providing assistance, avoid exposure to yourself or 
others.  Use adequate respiratory protection.  If respiratory irritation, dizziness, nausea, or 
unconsciousness occurs, seek immediate medical assistance.  If breathing has stopped, assist 
ventilation with a mechanical device or use mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. 
SKIN CONTACT
Wash contact areas with soap and water.  If product is injected into or under the skin, or into any 
part of the body, regardless of the appearance of the wound or its size, the individual should be 
evaluated immediately by a physician as a surgical emergency. Even though initial symptoms 
from high pressure injection may be minimal or absent, early surgical treatment within the first few 
hours may significantly reduce the ultimate extent of injury. 
EYE CONTACT
Flush thoroughly with water.  If irritation occurs, get medical assistance. 
INGESTION
First aid is normally not required. Seek medical attention if discomfort occurs. 
SECTION 5
FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES
EXTINGUISHING MEDIA
Appropriate Extinguishing Media:  Use water fog, foam, dry chemical or carbon dioxide (CO2) 
to extinguish flames.
Inappropriate Extinguishing Media:  Straight streams of water 
FIRE FIGHTING
Fire Fighting Instructions:  Evacuate area.  Prevent run-off from fire control or dilution from 
entering streams, sewers or drinking water supply.  Fire-fighters should use standard protective 
equipment and in enclosed spaces, self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).   Use water 
spray to cool fire exposed surfaces and to protect personnel.   
Hazardous Combustion Products:   Smoke, Fume, Aldehydes, Sulphur oxides, Incomplete 
combustion products, Oxides of carbon 
FLAMMABILITY PROPERTIES 
Flash Point [Method]:  460°F [ASTM D-92]

SECTION 6
ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES
NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES
In the event of a spill or accidental release, notify relevant authorities in accordance with all 
applicable regulations. 
PROTECTIVE MEASURES
Avoid contact with spilled material.  See Section 5 for firefighting information.  See the Hazard 
Identification Section for Significant Hazards.  See Section 4 for First Aid Advice.  See Section 8

for advice on the minimum requirements for personal protective equipment. Additional protective 
measures may be necessary, depending on the specific circumstances and/or the expert 
judgment of the emergency responders.   
SPILL MANAGEMENT
Land Spill:  Stop leak if you can do so without risk.  Recover by pumping or with suitable 
absorbent. 
Water Spill:  Stop leak if you can do so without risk.  Confine the spill immediately with booms.  
Warn other shipping.  Remove from the surface by skimming or with suitable absorbents.  Seek 
the advice of a specialist before using dispersants. 
Water spill and land spill recommendations are based on the most likely spill scenario for this 
material; however, geographic conditions, wind, temperature, (and in the case of a water spill) 
wave and current direction and speed may greatly influence the appropriate action to be taken.  
For this reason, local experts should be consulted.  Note:  Local regulations may prescribe or limit 
action to be taken.  
ENVIRONMENTAL PRECAUTIONS
Large Spills:  Dyke far ahead of liquid spill for later recovery and disposal.  Prevent entry into 
waterways, sewers, basements or confined areas. 
SECTION 7
HANDLING AND STORAGE
HANDLING
 Prevent small spills and leakage to avoid slip hazard.   Material can accumulate static charges 
which may cause an electrical spark (ignition source).  When the material is handled in bulk, an 
electrical spark could ignite any flammable vapors from liquids or residues that may be present 
(e.g., during switch-loading operations).  Use proper bonding and/or earthing procedures.  
However, bonding and earthing may not eliminate the hazard from static accumulation.  Consult 
local applicable standards for guidance.  Additional references include American Petroleum 
Institute 2003 (Protection Against Ignitions Arising out of Static, Lightning and Stray Currents) or 
National Fire Protection Agency 77 (Recommended Practice on Static Electricity) or CENELEC 
CLC/TR 50404 (Electrostatics - Code of practice for the avoidance of hazards due to static 
electricity).    
Static Accumulator:   This material is a static accumulator. 
STORAGE
The container choice, for example storage vessel, may effect static accumulation and dissipation.  Do not 
store in open or unlabeled containers.        
Material is defined under the National Standard [NOHSC: 1015] Storage and Handling of Workplace 
Dangerous Goods.
SECTION 8
EXPOSURE CONTROLS / PERSONAL PROTECTION
Exposure limits/standards for materials that can be formed when handling this product:   
NOTE: Limits/standards shown for guidance only.  Follow applicable regulations. 
Biological limits 
No biological limits allocated.

ENGINEERING CONTROLS 
The level of protection and types of controls necessary will vary depending upon potential 
exposure conditions.  Control measures to consider: 
 No special requirements under ordinary conditions of use and with adequate ventilation. 
PERSONAL PROTECTION 
Personal protective equipment selections vary based on potential exposure conditions such as 
applications, handling practices, concentration and ventilation.  Information on the selection of 
protective equipment for use with this material, as provided below, is based upon intended, 
normal usage.   
Respiratory Protection:   If engineering controls do not maintain airborne contaminant 
concentrations at a level which is adequate to protect worker health, an approved respirator may 
be appropriate.  Respirator selection, use, and maintenance must be in accordance with 
regulatory requirements, if applicable.  Types of respirators to be considered for this material 
include:  
Particulate 
For high airborne concentrations, use an approved supplied-air respirator, operated in positive 
pressure mode.  Supplied air respirators with an escape bottle may be appropriate when oxygen 
levels are inadequate, gas/vapor warning properties are poor, or if air purifying filter 
capacity/rating may be exceeded. 
Hand Protection:   Any specific glove information provided is based on published literature and 
glove manufacturer data.  Glove suitability and breakthrough time will differ depending on the 
specific use conditions. Contact the glove manufacturer for specific advice on glove selection and 
breakthrough times for your use conditions. Inspect and replace worn or damaged gloves. The 
types of gloves to be considered for this material include: 
Nitrile, Viton 
No protection is ordinarily required under normal conditions of use. 
Eye Protection:   If contact is likely, safety glasses with side shields are recommended. 
Skin and Body Protection:    Any specific clothing information provided is based on published 
literature or manufacturer data.  The types of clothing to be considered for this material include: 
 No skin protection is ordinarily required under normal conditions of use.  In accordance 
with good industrial hygiene practices, precautions should be taken to avoid skin contact. 
Specific Hygiene Measures:   Always observe good personal hygiene measures, such as 
washing after handling the material and before eating, drinking, and/or smoking. Routinely wash 
work clothing and protective equipment to remove contaminants. Discard contaminated clothing 
and footwear that cannot be cleaned. Practice good housekeeping. 
ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS 
 Comply with applicable environmental regulations limiting discharge to air, water and soil. Protect 
the environment by applying appropriate control measures to prevent or limit emissions.
