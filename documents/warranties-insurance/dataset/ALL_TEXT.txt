Warranties & Insurance 
 
Summary 
 
PermaFrost NMR® has been deployed over 300,000 times across 38 countries. It has 
never damaged a HVAC unit in any way. No customer has ever filed a claim of 
damage (link here). 
 
PermaFrost NMR® is a nanotechnology chemical formulation. The chemical reaction 
is the same every time it is injected into a HVAC unit. Charged particles interact with 
metal surfaces dislodging oil and other foreign molecules. The process does not 
affect anything else. It does not change the machine’s design or function in any way. 
As a result, the treatment does not violate or void OEM warranties. Your OEM will 
agree.  
 
OEM Warranties 
 
• OEM warranties are a contract with the customer. They can only be voided by 
a customer’s breach of the contract terms   
• The warranty covers the OEM’s machine and replacement parts 
• OEMs do not warrant or cover the parts of other suppliers  
• Warranties are voided if another supplier changes the machine’s design or 
function 
• PermaFrost NMR® chemical treatment cannot physically change a machine’s 
design or function. OEMs agree. The treatment returns a machine to or near 
OEM design cooling efficiency by removing foreign debris that has 
accumulated post-manufacture 
Powertron Warranties & Insurance 
 
• Powertron warrants PermaFrost NMR® treatment will not damage a machine 
in any way. It provides insurance coverage from a F500 carrier that protects 
against both machine damage and loss of revenue 
• Up-to $2M in coverage per machine treated (link to policy) 
• Loss of revenue coverage is extraordinary and is provided due to the fact that 
in over 300,000 deployments there has never been a single damage claim filed
