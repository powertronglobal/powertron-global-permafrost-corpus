Recovered Unit Cost with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
The kW/ton is the standard Unit Cost  in the HVAC 
industry. It is the HVAC industry’s standard of 
determining how much energy is required to create 1 ton 
of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you reduce your 
unit cost of cooling you are saving regardless of how 
much overall cooling you require.
Data Center Provider has the industry epidemic problem of thermal 
degradation in their Chillers and HVAC units. The 
degraded equipment performance is costing Data Center Provider 
significant operational dollars through wasted energy, 
and capital dollars through additional run time, work 
load, maintenance and replacement costs. The 35 NYC2 
CRAC units were found to be using significantly more 
energy to operate than when they were new, and lost 
capacity is wearing out units faster.
The chart below illustrates the performance restoration the ECM created in the treated units. The average 
operational efficiency ratings of the 35 units before being treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, were 1.35.
The average operational efficiency ratings of the 35 units after being treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as 
calculated in kW/ton, are currently 1.06. The higher baseline kW/ton ratings measured  in-situ were 
expected when compared to the ASHRAE predicted loss of operational performance efficiency for similar 
age and type cooling units.
