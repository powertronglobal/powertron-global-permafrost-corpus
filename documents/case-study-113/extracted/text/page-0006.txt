Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the 35 Data Center Provider CRAC cooling units.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Avg. Baseline Tonnage: 741 tons
Avg. Adjusted kW Baseline: 1.35 kW/ton * 924 tons = 1,247 kW
Avg. Adjusted Baseline kWh: 1,247 kW * 4,380 Annual Operating Hrs = 5,461,860 kWh
Avg. Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 5,461,860 kWh * $.16 = $873,898
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: 1.06 kW/ton * 924 tons = 979 kW
Annual kWh Post: 979 kW * 4,380 hours = 4,288,020 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 4,288,020 kWh * $.16 cents = $686,083
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $873,898 - $686,083 = $187,815
Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $187,815 / 12 = $15,651
Initial Payback Period
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in each of the 36 CRAC cooling units: $100,250  
Estimated ROI Period for Data Center Provider NYC2 on all 35 CRAC cooling units: $100,250 / $15,651 = 6.4 Months
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 187%
Return on Investment Over 10 Years = 1,873%
Utilizing data collected during the pilot study, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for 
Data Center Provider for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in both capacity and efficiency. Working together, these improvements reduce the 
annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the avg cooling 
unit was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity 
and then subtracting the revised cost to run the avg cooling unit at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® 
ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of 
hours or load % the unit will now operate at due to the restored performance profile. This restored performance profile 
allows the cooling unit to satisfy the internal area set point with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor 
demand loading.
