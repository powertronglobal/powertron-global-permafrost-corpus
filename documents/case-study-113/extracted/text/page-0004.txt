Summary of Key Performance Measurements
For All 35 Treated CRAC Units 
The charts below summarize the substantial improvements resulting from the implementation of the 
PermaFrost NMR® ECM into all 35 of the CRAC cooling units. The performance improvements are very similar 
to the 13 year historical performance averages in similar type equipment measured in the field. The results are 
also very much in line with the improvements demonstrated on DX equipment inside the control chamber at 
the Underwriters Laboratories HVAC testing facility in [Texas Location], TX.
