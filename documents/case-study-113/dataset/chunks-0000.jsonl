First, to verify the current as-is capacity and efficiency of 35 various \nComputer Room Air Conditioning (CRAC) systems supporting the five Data Center Provider data center suites within the \n[Commercial Building] located at [Building Address] in New York, NY. Second, to demonstrate what, if any, material \nperformance changes occur in these same cooling units after being treated with PermaFrost NMR® ECM. And \nthird, to determine what, if any, financial benefits are associated with any efficiency improvements realized.  \nThe identification of CRAC units involved in the study are recorded in Appendix A. \nECM Product Brief\nPermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented surface science nanotechnology that uses Nucleo Molecular \nRegenerative (NMR®) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, one-time treatment with no down time \nrequired, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type of climate control system in which it is \ninstalled.  The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling efficiency and increased capacity, \nboth of which result in lower overall costs to operate a system and extended equipment life.\nMethodology\nAfter determining the amount of air flowing across the evaporator coil was within 20% of manufacturer design \n(higher or lower) before beginning the testing of each unit, the subsequent measurements used in the efficiency \ncalculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the IPMVP (International Measurement and \nVerification Protocol) framework. \nThe results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic \nengineering formulas:\n• kW = (Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47)/1000 (for 3-Phase) \n• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage \n• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)\n• EER = Capacity in BTU’s / Power in Watts\n• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = (Measured CFM * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta T) / 12,000 BTU\n \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 795, "chars": 3506, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_109_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:9d42df707899bb79f4e30e756dff414d9d0c88d1489217dac6b6ca3e29b86f8a"}

It is the HVAC industry’s standard of \ndetermining how much energy is required to create 1 ton \nof cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you reduce your \nunit cost of cooling you are saving regardless of how \nmuch overall cooling you require.\nData Center Provider has the industry epidemic problem of thermal \ndegradation in their Chillers and HVAC units. The \ndegraded equipment performance is costing Data Center Provider \nsignificant operational dollars through wasted energy, \nand capital dollars through additional run time, work \nload, maintenance and replacement costs. The 35 NYC2 \nCRAC units were found to be using significantly more \nenergy to operate than when they were new, and lost \ncapacity is wearing out units faster.\nThe chart below illustrates the performance restoration the ECM created in the treated units. The average \noperational efficiency ratings of the 35 units before being treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in \nkW/ton, were 1.35.\nThe average operational efficiency ratings of the 35 units after being treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as \ncalculated in kW/ton, are currently 1.06. The higher baseline kW/ton ratings measured  in-situ were \nexpected when compared to the ASHRAE predicted loss of operational performance efficiency for similar \nage and type cooling units.  \nCost to Operate\nkW/ton\nBaseline\nPost ECM\n1.35\n1.06\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 529, "chars": 2241, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_109_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_109_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:3723f870fc14e317780586846dcc25d095bbedd97d4761855c099715e12733ab"}

Working together, these improvements reduce the \nannual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the avg cooling \nunit was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity \nand then subtracting the revised cost to run the avg cooling unit at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® \nECM was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of \nhours or load % the unit will now operate at due to the restored performance profile. This restored performance profile \nallows the cooling unit to satisfy the internal area set point with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor \ndemand loading.\n5\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 683, "chars": 2851, "pages": {"start": 5, "end": 6}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_109_chunk_0003", "next_id": "pdf_109_chunk_0005", "content_hash": "sha256:8908cccce22e28fd7cfeaad2a27bc26121cf60ff5221133755cc9522061a5ca6"}
