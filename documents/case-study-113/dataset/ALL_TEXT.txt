HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report
Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study
The purpose of this jointly-conducted ECM study between Data Center Provider (now owned by Data Center REIT) and PTG 
engineering teams was threefold. First, to verify the current as-is capacity and efficiency of 35 various 
Computer Room Air Conditioning (CRAC) systems supporting the five Data Center Provider data center suites within the 
[Commercial Building] located at [Building Address] in New York, NY. Second, to demonstrate what, if any, material 
performance changes occur in these same cooling units after being treated with PermaFrost NMR® ECM. And 
third, to determine what, if any, financial benefits are associated with any efficiency improvements realized.  
The identification of CRAC units involved in the study are recorded in Appendix A. 
ECM Product Brief
PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented surface science nanotechnology that uses Nucleo Molecular 
Regenerative (NMR®) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, one-time treatment with no down time 
required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type of climate control system in which it is 
installed.  The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling efficiency and increased capacity, 
both of which result in lower overall costs to operate a system and extended equipment life.
Methodology
After determining the amount of air flowing across the evaporator coil was within 20% of manufacturer design 
(higher or lower) before beginning the testing of each unit, the subsequent measurements used in the efficiency 
calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the IPMVP (International Measurement and 
Verification Protocol) framework. 
The results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic 
engineering formulas:
• kW = (Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47)/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
• EER = Capacity in BTU’s / Power in Watts
• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = (Measured CFM * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta T) / 12,000 BTU

Recovered Unit Cost with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
The kW/ton is the standard Unit Cost  in the HVAC 
industry. It is the HVAC industry’s standard of 
determining how much energy is required to create 1 ton 
of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you reduce your 
unit cost of cooling you are saving regardless of how 
much overall cooling you require.
Data Center Provider has the industry epidemic problem of thermal 
degradation in their Chillers and HVAC units. The 
degraded equipment performance is costing Data Center Provider 
significant operational dollars through wasted energy, 
and capital dollars through additional run time, work 
load, maintenance and replacement costs. The 35 NYC2 
CRAC units were found to be using significantly more 
energy to operate than when they were new, and lost 
capacity is wearing out units faster.
The chart below illustrates the performance restoration the ECM created in the treated units. The average 
operational efficiency ratings of the 35 units before being treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, were 1.35.
The average operational efficiency ratings of the 35 units after being treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as 
calculated in kW/ton, are currently 1.06. The higher baseline kW/ton ratings measured  in-situ were 
expected when compared to the ASHRAE predicted loss of operational performance efficiency for similar 
age and type cooling units.

Summary of Key Performance Measurements
For All 35 Treated CRAC Units 
The charts below summarize the substantial improvements resulting from the implementation of the 
PermaFrost NMR® ECM into all 35 of the CRAC cooling units. The performance improvements are very similar 
to the 13 year historical performance averages in similar type equipment measured in the field. The results are 
also very much in line with the improvements demonstrated on DX equipment inside the control chamber at 
the Underwriters Laboratories HVAC testing facility in [Texas Location], TX.

Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the 35 Data Center Provider CRAC cooling units.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Avg. Baseline Tonnage: 741 tons
Avg. Adjusted kW Baseline: 1.35 kW/ton * 924 tons = 1,247 kW
Avg. Adjusted Baseline kWh: 1,247 kW * 4,380 Annual Operating Hrs = 5,461,860 kWh
Avg. Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 5,461,860 kWh * $.16 = $873,898
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: 1.06 kW/ton * 924 tons = 979 kW
Annual kWh Post: 979 kW * 4,380 hours = 4,288,020 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 4,288,020 kWh * $.16 cents = $686,083
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $873,898 - $686,083 = $187,815
Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $187,815 / 12 = $15,651
Initial Payback Period
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in each of the 36 CRAC cooling units: $100,250  
Estimated ROI Period for Data Center Provider NYC2 on all 35 CRAC cooling units: $100,250 / $15,651 = 6.4 Months
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 187%
Return on Investment Over 10 Years = 1,873%
Utilizing data collected during the pilot study, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for 
Data Center Provider for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in both capacity and efficiency. Working together, these improvements reduce the 
annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the avg cooling 
unit was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity 
and then subtracting the revised cost to run the avg cooling unit at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® 
ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of 
hours or load % the unit will now operate at due to the restored performance profile. This restored performance profile 
allows the cooling unit to satisfy the internal area set point with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor 
demand loading.

Capital Beneﬁts for Data Center Provider when Implementing
PermaFrost NMR®
The capacity recovered after the PermaFrost NMR® treatment has substantial capital benefits including cost 
avoidance, deferred capital expense and capital improvement in addition to the reduced energy cost to run the 
systems. These are instantaneous benefits realized as soon as the technology is installed.
Treating the 35 HVAC units with PermaFrost NMR® allows Data Center Provider to realize the following financial benefits:
 
 
1. Restoration of 183 tons of HVAC Capacity: Current rate to purchase commercial rooftop HVAC 
 
    capacity is ~ $1000 per ton installed. 
 
2. Deferred Capital Cost: Extending the remaining useful life of HVAC equipment will defer capital 
 
    cost of replacement. The average age of the treated systems in the pilot is approximately 10 years 
 
    with a conservative five years (30%) service life remaining. The systems will experience an estimated 
 
    1-1.5 years of additional service life, deferring replacement costs by 20%. 
 
3. Reduction in Energy Use/Expense: Using a conservative 20% efficiency improvement measured in 
 
    kw/ton, the annual cost to run treated systems will drop proportionally - independent of HVAC load.
Summary 
Investment   
 
• $117.50 per ton installed x 802 tons

Data Center Provider is Saving More than Just Energy
By treating just the 35 cooling units with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the manner in which the pilot units 
are currently being operated, Data Center Provider will save approximately 1,173,840 kWh per year and all the costs 
associated with those savings. 
From an environmental impact standpoint, Data Center Provider will benefit all the surrounding NYC communities in which 
they operate. Imagine the positive environmental impacts of treating the rest of the Data Center Provider and Data Center REIT 
portfolio of equipment spread across the world.  
The 1,173,840 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 809 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from 
being released or any of the following:
Annual greenhouse emissions from:
CO2 emissions from:
