Energy Performance Report
US Navy Vessel Benavidez
April 2, 2012
Technical Narrative
This reports contains the details regarding the installation of PermaFrost NMR™ in chiller #1 of the US Navy Vessel 
Benavidez.  PermaFrost NMR® is a chemical designed to correct the issue of thermal inefficiency in HVACR 
equipment. 
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) was used to develop this 
report.  The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and 
Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the IPMVP 
as a global standard.
There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. 
Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.
Retrofit Isolation (Option B) is defined as: All parameter measurement.  Savings are determined by field 
measurement of the energy use of the energy conservation method affected equipment or system.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period.  The savings are calculated by short term or continuous 
measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using 
measurements of proxies of energy use. 
The final computation follows the formula:

Option B Savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy

System Description / Design Characteristics
The chilled water distribution plant of The US Navy Vessel Benavidez is equipped with five York centrifugal chillers. 
Each chiller is equipped with a chilled water centrifugal pump feeding a common header. The two chillers 
in this report are indentical make and model with approximately 1.6 years of runtime.
  
The fresh water-cooled condensers of these chillers are fed from a central fresh water loop that is cooled via 
plate and frame heat exchangers utilizing seawater as the heat exchange / rejection medium. Operational 
conditions are distinctly different when the vessel is docked versus when at sea. The results of this report are 
predicated on operation while docked. The air conditioning plant while docked only has the ability to 
operate one chiller at a time. This is due to the reduced fresh water flow provided by the in port central fresh 
water circulating pump. While docked many of the large square foot areas cooled by the energy plant are 
non-active. Areas that are active are living quarters, bridge and other areas required for the daily non 
-commissioned activities of this vessel. 
The cooling coils that are served by this chilled water 
distribution system are controlled by two-way solenoid 
valves. Upon satisfaction of the temperature requirements 
of the conditioned space these valves will close until the 
space temperature rises. 
At the time of this performance verification the vessel was 
docked and one chiller was being utilized. This IPMVP Plan 
was developed with a defined measurement boundary. That boundary is comprised of Chiller #1 and 
Chiller #5. This boundary was selected with the assistance of the ship’s Chief Engineer [Client Representative]. Chiller 
#1 and #5 are both York Codepak Model YKM2M2G4-CBS Centrifugal water-cooled chillers each rated at 330 
tons equipped with R-134a refrigerant. 
Each chiller was subjected to identical performance parameters demonstrated by the local control of the 
incremental loading of each chiller within a controlled parameter. The verification process was initiated and 
concluded on two consecutive days.  Each day began with no chillers running. One chilled water pump was 
operating in an effort to increase the load on the chilled water loop to a maximum of 80 deg. F.

Baseline Measurement Period Selection
Chiller #1 was treated with PermaFrost NMR® on August 17, 2011.  There was a pre and post measurement 
and verification performed to develop a baseline to determine the efficacy of this energy conservation 
measure that consisted of chiller #1 (unit treated with PermaFrost NMR®) and chiller #5 (no PermaFrost 
NMR® treatment). 
Each chiller was started and limited to the load factor of 80% by limiting the inlet guide vane position of the 
machines for a period of five minutes.  During this five-minute period the following parameters were 
recorded:
Chiller kW, Chilled Water Delta T, Condenser Water Delta T, Condensed Liquid Refrigerant Temperature, 
Saturated Evaporator Refrigerant Temperature, Actual Tonnage and kW per Ton.
The results were formulated by entering the data into thermodynamic engineering formulas.
These formulas are as follows:
• To determine the kW, voltage, amperage and power factor were recorded using a digital kW meter.  Data 
from that meter is automatically calculated.  Those data streams were verified by the manual calculation for 
determining kW energy as:
 
Volts X Amps X .85 X 1.73 / 1000 = kW
• To determine the tonnage the following formula was utilized:
 
GPM X 8.34 X 60 X Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU = Actual Tonnage
• To determine the actual kW per ton the following formula was utilized:
 
Actual kW / Actual Tonnage = kW per Ton

There was a veriﬁed eﬃciency gain as this data was inspected. 
The following is a summary of the energy reduction results.
Chiller #1 used less energy and delivered more tonnage than chiller #5.  The efficiency of the heat exchange 
surfaces for chiller #1 was greater than chiller #5 resulting in improvement of the ability to cool the chilled 
water supply to the load using less energy.

The following is the ﬁnancial calculations regarding the energy conservation method:
There are two financial formulations to be considered.  At Sea Power calculations will be using the diesel 
generated energy cost of  $0.28 per kW-hr for the deployed vessels at 3500 operating hours per year (2 
chillers on line in pre-positioned deployment) and the Shore Power calculations using the dockside 
electrical costs of $0.10 per kW-hr (national average) at 1750 hours per year as recommended by Chief 
Wakeham.

Conclusion
The improved efficiency (kW per ton) at the unit at 80% load was 9.4% with and additional 3.8% increase 
in capacity.  The improvement in the refrigerant approach, a measurable thermodynamic enhancement 
of PermaFrost NMR®, at 80% load was 53%.  These results are highly significant.  Chiller #1 not only 
provides chilled water at the rated GPM and design chilled water outlet temperature at reduced kW-hr and 
cost, it also does this at a greater tonnage per kW.  This allows the chiller to produce more tonnage at less 
energy. 
These results are in line with what we would expect on a chiller that has only 1.6 years of actual runtime. 
According to ASHRAE, thermal inefficiency of the heat transfer surfaces of air conditioning and refrigeration 
systems, will cause a loss of about 7% efficiency the first year, 5% the second year, and 2% per year the 
following years.  This loss will continue to accumulate until equilibrium is reached between flow force and 
adhesion.  At this point the thermal boundary layer formed has achieved its maximum thickness, producing 
maximum loss of efficiency.  Published ASHRAE information confirms these observations.  According to 
ASHRAE, performance is degraded by as much as 30% due to the thermal degradation of internal 
surfaces.  Higher percentages up to 40% have been observed in systems 20 years old or older.
These identical units (Chiller #1 & #5) have approximately 1.6 years of actual runtime, which equates to a 
loss of efficiency of 9.6% according to the above thermal inefficiency rates from ASHRAE. The efficiency 
improvement on Chiller #1 is 9.4%, which puts these results in line with a ASHRAE.  Now that Chiller #1 
has been treated with PermaFrost NMR®, the efficiency has been restored and the heat exchange surfaces 
are now protected from thermal inefficiency reoccurring for the life of the unit.
Chiller number one, treated with PermaFrost NMR®, has produced significant results.  Additionally, there 
are several direct benefits and indirect benefits that increase the return on investment but may not be easily 
measured.  These additional direct and indirect benefits are as follows:
• Increased tonnage per kW will allow the staff to operate this chiller in some time periods as the only chiller 
that will be required versus operating two chillers to capture a similar load.  The scenario of 80 percent load

factors were used because the chiller produced more available tonnage as a direct result of PermaFrost 
NMR®'s ability to improve the heat exchange process of the chiller tubes in the evaporator and condenser. 
• Additional benefits include special ingredients formulated for these specific chillers that condition the seals 
(mainly the shaft seals on this design) and all bearing surfaces.  These York Marine Pak chillers contain 
aluminum sleeve bearings and low / high speed thrust bearings that have very small tolerances for wear.  
PermaFrost NMR® will reside on the surfaces of these components to allow the the refrigerant system to deliver above normal protection.  This benefit is directly related to additional operational hours within the 
life cycle analysis therefore reducing maintenance costs.  PermaFrost NMR® also includes acid scavengers 
and anti-humectants in its patented blends for added protection of the refrigeration circuit.
