PermaFrost NMR® is a chemical designed to correct the issue of thermal inefficiency in HVACR \nequipment. \nThe International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) was used to develop this \nreport.  The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and \nAir-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the IPMVP \nas a global standard.\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. \nRetrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.\nRetrofit Isolation (Option B) is defined as: All parameter measurement.  Savings are determined by field \nmeasurement of the energy use of the energy conservation method affected equipment or system.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  The savings are calculated by short term or continuous \nmeasurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using \nmeasurements of proxies of energy use. \nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B Savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n®\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 491, "chars": 2307, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_111_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:25e5b8874705bad1e7e0f2eb9cd988af80699483d4d2f205d1905fbb77e347ad"}

The two chillers \nin this report are indentical make and model with approximately 1.6 years of runtime.\n  \nThe fresh water-cooled condensers of these chillers are fed from a central fresh water loop that is cooled via \nplate and frame heat exchangers utilizing seawater as the heat exchange / rejection medium. Operational \nconditions are distinctly different when the vessel is docked versus when at sea. The results of this report are \npredicated on operation while docked. The air conditioning plant while docked only has the ability to \noperate one chiller at a time. This is due to the reduced fresh water flow provided by the in port central fresh \nwater circulating pump. While docked many of the large square foot areas cooled by the energy plant are \nnon-active. Areas that are active are living quarters, bridge and other areas required for the daily non \n-commissioned activities of this vessel. \nThe cooling coils that are served by this chilled water \ndistribution system are controlled by two-way solenoid \nvalves. Upon satisfaction of the temperature requirements \nof the conditioned space these valves will close until the \nspace temperature rises. \nAt the time of this performance verification the vessel was \ndocked and one chiller was being utilized. This IPMVP Plan \nwas developed with a defined measurement boundary. That boundary is comprised of Chiller #1 and \nChiller #5. This boundary was selected with the assistance of the ship’s Chief Engineer [Client Representative]. Chiller \n#1 and #5 are both York Codepak Model YKM2M2G4-CBS Centrifugal water-cooled chillers each rated at 330 \ntons equipped with R-134a refrigerant. \nEach chiller was subjected to identical performance parameters demonstrated by the local control of the \nincremental loading of each chiller within a controlled parameter. The verification process was initiated and \nconcluded on two consecutive days.  Each day began with no chillers running. One chilled water pump was \noperating in an effort to increase the load on the chilled water loop to a maximum of 80 deg.

The improvement in the refrigerant approach, a measurable thermodynamic enhancement \nof PermaFrost NMR®, at 80% load was 53%.  These results are highly significant.  Chiller #1 not only \nprovides chilled water at the rated GPM and design chilled water outlet temperature at reduced kW-hr and \ncost, it also does this at a greater tonnage per kW.  This allows the chiller to produce more tonnage at less \nenergy. \nThese results are in line with what we would expect on a chiller that has only 1.6 years of actual runtime. \nAccording to ASHRAE, thermal inefficiency of the heat transfer surfaces of air conditioning and refrigeration \nsystems, will cause a loss of about 7% efficiency the first year, 5% the second year, and 2% per year the \nfollowing years.  This loss will continue to accumulate until equilibrium is reached between flow force and \nadhesion.  At this point the thermal boundary layer formed has achieved its maximum thickness, producing \nmaximum loss of efficiency.  Published ASHRAE information confirms these observations.  According to \nASHRAE, performance is degraded by as much as 30% due to the thermal degradation of internal \nsurfaces.  Higher percentages up to 40% have been observed in systems 20 years old or older.\nThese identical units (Chiller #1 & #5) have approximately 1.6 years of actual runtime, which equates to a \nloss of efficiency of 9.6% according to the above thermal inefficiency rates from ASHRAE. The efficiency \nimprovement on Chiller #1 is 9.4%, which puts these results in line with a ASHRAE.  Now that Chiller #1 \nhas been treated with PermaFrost NMR®, the efficiency has been restored and the heat exchange surfaces \nare now protected from thermal inefficiency reoccurring for the life of the unit.\nChiller number one, treated with PermaFrost NMR®, has produced significant results.  Additionally, there \nare several direct benefits and indirect benefits that increase the return on investment but may not be easily \nmeasured.  These additional direct and indirect benefits are as follows:\n• Increased tonnage per kW will allow the staff to operate this chiller in some time periods as the only chiller \nthat will be required versus operating two chillers to capture a similar load.

These York Marine Pak chillers contain \naluminum sleeve bearings and low / high speed thrust bearings that have very small tolerances for wear.  \nPermaFrost NMR® will reside on the surfaces of these components to allow the the refrigerant system to deliver above normal protection.  This benefit is directly related to additional operational hours within the \nlife cycle analysis therefore reducing maintenance costs.  PermaFrost NMR® also includes acid scavengers \nand anti-humectants in its patented blends for added protection of the refrigeration circuit.\nEnergy Science Division\n®\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 935, "chars": 4236, "pages": {"start": 8, "end": 10}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_111_chunk_0005", "next_id": "", "content_hash": "sha256:832c5e3625a4d39836aa441d48b306393d524caf1b234bc4a31facdab4b7f367"}
