Energy Performance Report
US Navy Vessel Benavidez
April 2, 2012
Technical Narrative
This reports contains the details regarding the installation of PermaFrost NMR™ in chiller #1 of the US Navy Vessel 
Benavidez.  PermaFrost NMR® is a chemical designed to correct the issue of thermal inefficiency in HVACR 
equipment. 
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) was used to develop this 
report.  The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and 
Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the IPMVP 
as a global standard.
There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. 
Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.
Retrofit Isolation (Option B) is defined as: All parameter measurement.  Savings are determined by field 
measurement of the energy use of the energy conservation method affected equipment or system.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period.  The savings are calculated by short term or continuous 
measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using 
measurements of proxies of energy use. 
The final computation follows the formula:
Energy Science Division
Option B Savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy
