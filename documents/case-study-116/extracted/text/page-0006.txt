Energy Reporting Period Selection
On March 13, 2012 chiller #1 (previously treated with PermaFrost NMR® on August 17, 2011) was operated 
under the identical characteristics that were used for the baseline reporting period of chiller #5. The 
following results were recorded as a result of the implementation of The IPMVP Protocol.
This data was determined using the exact engineering thermodynamic formulas used previously for chiller #5.
