There was a veriﬁed eﬃciency gain as this data was inspected. 
The following is a summary of the energy reduction results.
Chiller #1 used less energy and delivered more tonnage than chiller #5.  The efficiency of the heat exchange 
surfaces for chiller #1 was greater than chiller #5 resulting in improvement of the ability to cool the chilled 
water supply to the load using less energy.
