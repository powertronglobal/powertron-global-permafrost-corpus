Baseline Measurement Period Selection
Chiller #1 was treated with PermaFrost NMR® on August 17, 2011.  There was a pre and post measurement 
and verification performed to develop a baseline to determine the efficacy of this energy conservation 
measure that consisted of chiller #1 (unit treated with PermaFrost NMR®) and chiller #5 (no PermaFrost 
NMR® treatment). 
Each chiller was started and limited to the load factor of 80% by limiting the inlet guide vane position of the 
machines for a period of five minutes.  During this five-minute period the following parameters were 
recorded:
Chiller kW, Chilled Water Delta T, Condenser Water Delta T, Condensed Liquid Refrigerant Temperature, 
Saturated Evaporator Refrigerant Temperature, Actual Tonnage and kW per Ton.
The results were formulated by entering the data into thermodynamic engineering formulas.
These formulas are as follows:
• To determine the kW, voltage, amperage and power factor were recorded using a digital kW meter.  Data 
from that meter is automatically calculated.  Those data streams were verified by the manual calculation for 
determining kW energy as:
 
Volts X Amps X .85 X 1.73 / 1000 = kW
• To determine the tonnage the following formula was utilized:
 
GPM X 8.34 X 60 X Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU = Actual Tonnage
• To determine the actual kW per ton the following formula was utilized:
 
Actual kW / Actual Tonnage = kW per Ton
