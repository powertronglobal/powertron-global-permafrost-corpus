The following is the ﬁnancial calculations regarding the energy conservation method:
There are two financial formulations to be considered.  At Sea Power calculations will be using the diesel 
generated energy cost of  $0.28 per kW-hr for the deployed vessels at 3500 operating hours per year (2 
chillers on line in pre-positioned deployment) and the Shore Power calculations using the dockside 
electrical costs of $0.10 per kW-hr (national average) at 1750 hours per year as recommended by Chief 
Wakeham.
