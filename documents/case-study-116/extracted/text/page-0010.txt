factors were used because the chiller produced more available tonnage as a direct result of PermaFrost 
NMR®'s ability to improve the heat exchange process of the chiller tubes in the evaporator and condenser. 
• Additional benefits include special ingredients formulated for these specific chillers that condition the seals 
(mainly the shaft seals on this design) and all bearing surfaces.  These York Marine Pak chillers contain 
aluminum sleeve bearings and low / high speed thrust bearings that have very small tolerances for wear.  
PermaFrost NMR® will reside on the surfaces of these components to allow the the refrigerant system to deliver above normal protection.  This benefit is directly related to additional operational hours within the 
life cycle analysis therefore reducing maintenance costs.  PermaFrost NMR® also includes acid scavengers 
and anti-humectants in its patented blends for added protection of the refrigeration circuit.
