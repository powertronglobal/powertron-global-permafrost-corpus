Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the pilot chiller to perform prior to the ECM 
being installed, as well as illustrate the amount of thermal degradation within the 
heat exchangers.
 
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
 
• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU 
 
• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Water Temp – Saturated Evaporator Temp (CH) 
Notes
Following a diagnostic examination to determine the operational condition of the chiller was satisfactory, Baseline M&V data 
was collected and recorded by the M&V team. 400+ runtime hours after installation of the ECM, the M&V team returned to 
take Post M&V measurements in the identical fashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements and associated 
calculations show the amount of capacity and efficiency restored.
The following IPMVP data points were recorded on 1/13/16 using recently calibrated by NIST (National Institutes of 
Standards and Technology) to insure measurement accuracy and in combination with the chiler's control panel. The chiller was 
then treated with PermaFrost NMR® on May 10, 2016 and allowed to run normally until 6/25/16 to ensure the patented 
surface science nanotechnology had ample time to seat into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All post measurements 
were taken at identical incoming water temperatures however the outside air temps were higher in the post by 9.5%. No 
weather adjustments were made.
