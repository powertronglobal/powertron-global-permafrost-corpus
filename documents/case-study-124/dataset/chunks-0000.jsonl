Many industry leading \norganizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age. \nThermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVAC/R equipment that operates as a \nvapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well \ndocumented by the HVAC/R industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal \ndegradation prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times \nand additional kWh consumption.\nThe chiller in this study (pictured below) is \nrepresentative of the portfolio of equipment operated by \nNon-Profit Organization. If thermal degradation is present in this chiller it \nis present in the entire inventory of equipment. Energy \nwaste can be calculated based on this equipment \n(portfolio representation) and then accurately \nextrapolated across the entire inventory of equipment.\nProcess\nThis report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of an air-cooled chiller that \nsupports the Non-Profit Organization Leeward Brach in Honolulu, HI. \nDetailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the pilot chiller before and after \nthe installation of the ECM to determine the impact on the three key elements that greatly affect the HVAC \npower bill as they relate to the original design specifications:\n \n \n1. The cooling capacity the chiller produces after 10 years in service, before and after the \n \n    administration of the ECM. \n \n2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the chiller can deliver as \n \n    reflected in the kW/ton measurement, before and after the administration of the ECM. \n \n3.  The thermal dynamic ability of the chiller to perform in relation to operational design, before and \n \n    after the administration of the ECM.\nThis report is provided to Non-Profit Organization.

The team consisted Michael Doss of \nthe Non-Profit Organization, Donogh Mc Sherry of [Energy Services Company]; and Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, \n[Senior Energy Engineer].\nNotes\nThe flow rate through the evaporator was near to design specifications in the baseline and post and the return chilled water \nentering the chiller in the baseline and post were identical so no adjustments were made. The outside air temps in the baseline \nwere 80.1 deg F while the temperature in post was 87.7 deg F. (7.6 degrees higher) clearly demonstrating the chillers ability to \ntransfer more heat through the heat exchangers.\nThis benchmark report demonstrated the deficiencies related to the thermal losses in the condenser and evaporator. The design \nof this chiller is 101.4 tons. This rating was certified by AHRI under the environmental conditions of 95 degrees F outdoor air \ntemperature and an entering chilled water temperature of 55 degrees F. Therefore the baseline was normalized to represent what \nthe actual tonnage that the chiller would be capable of delivering at full load. With the reduced environmental condition of 80 \ndegrees versus 95 degrees F of air that was entering the air cooled condenser during the test the tonnage or capacity should have \nbeen capable of producing 131 tons as shown in the baseline. During the capacity test four of the five compressors were required \nto operate to produce the design delta temperature performance of the chiller. \nThe post analysis of the chiller demonstrated the reversal of the deficiencies related to the initial thermal losses in the condenser \nand evaporator. Again with the design capacity of 101.4 tons at the environmental condition of an outdoor air temperature of \n95 degrees F the normalized capacity design rating is 131 tons. During the post testing period the outdoor environmental \nconditions were much warmer than the baseline by approx: 7 degrees F. During the capacity test the number of compressors \nrequired to deliver the delta temperature performance of the chiller was reduced from four to two compressors required to \noperate. This demonstrates that after the injection of Permafrost NMR® this chiller can deliver the needed thermal performance \nas a result of the enhancement of the evaporator and condensers ability to transfer thermal energy with much less energy and \nless run time on the compressors thereby offering longer life cycle expectancy. \nQuite simply the demonstration of the thermal enhancement received from PermaFrost NMR® allows this chiller to deliver the \nneeded tonnage with less compressors operating since the refrigeration effect of the evaporator and condenser have been \nthermally restored.\nThis report is provided to Non-Profit Organization.

The delta of these measurements and associated \ncalculations show the amount of capacity and efficiency restored.\nThe following IPMVP data points were recorded on 1/13/16 using recently calibrated by NIST (National Institutes of \nStandards and Technology) to insure measurement accuracy and in combination with the chiler's control panel. The chiller was \nthen treated with PermaFrost NMR® on May 10, 2016 and allowed to run normally until 6/25/16 to ensure the patented \nsurface science nanotechnology had ample time to seat into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All post measurements \nwere taken at identical incoming water temperatures however the outside air temps were higher in the post by 9.5%.

ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller was when operating at the original \nenergy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to \nrun the chiller at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® ECM was installed. This regression analysis is \nthe most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours or load the chiller will now operate due to \nthe restored capacity.
