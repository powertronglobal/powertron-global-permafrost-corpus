HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report
Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study
The purpose of this study is to verify the industry wide problem of efficiency loss in HVAC/R as projected by 
ASHRAE research and to quantify the amount of money wasted due to this loss. Many industry leading 
organizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age. 
Thermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVAC/R equipment that operates as a 
vapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well 
documented by the HVAC/R industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal 
degradation prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times 
and additional kWh consumption.
The chiller in this study (pictured below) is 
representative of the portfolio of equipment operated by 
Non-Profit Organization. If thermal degradation is present in this chiller it 
is present in the entire inventory of equipment. Energy 
waste can be calculated based on this equipment 
(portfolio representation) and then accurately 
extrapolated across the entire inventory of equipment.
Process
This report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of an air-cooled chiller that 
supports the Non-Profit Organization Leeward Brach in Honolulu, HI. 
Detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the pilot chiller before and after 
the installation of the ECM to determine the impact on the three key elements that greatly affect the HVAC 
power bill as they relate to the original design specifications:
 
 
1. The cooling capacity the chiller produces after 10 years in service, before and after the 
 
    administration of the ECM. 
 
2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the chiller can deliver as 
 
    reflected in the kW/ton measurement, before and after the administration of the ECM. 
 
3.  The thermal dynamic ability of the chiller to perform in relation to operational design, before and 
 
    after the administration of the ECM.

Methodology
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the 
IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted Michael Doss of 
the Non-Profit Organization, Donogh Mc Sherry of [Energy Services Company]; and Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, 
[Senior Energy Engineer].
Notes
The flow rate through the evaporator was near to design specifications in the baseline and post and the return chilled water 
entering the chiller in the baseline and post were identical so no adjustments were made. The outside air temps in the baseline 
were 80.1 deg F while the temperature in post was 87.7 deg F. (7.6 degrees higher) clearly demonstrating the chillers ability to 
transfer more heat through the heat exchangers.
This benchmark report demonstrated the deficiencies related to the thermal losses in the condenser and evaporator. The design 
of this chiller is 101.4 tons. This rating was certified by AHRI under the environmental conditions of 95 degrees F outdoor air 
temperature and an entering chilled water temperature of 55 degrees F. Therefore the baseline was normalized to represent what 
the actual tonnage that the chiller would be capable of delivering at full load. With the reduced environmental condition of 80 
degrees versus 95 degrees F of air that was entering the air cooled condenser during the test the tonnage or capacity should have 
been capable of producing 131 tons as shown in the baseline. During the capacity test four of the five compressors were required 
to operate to produce the design delta temperature performance of the chiller. 
The post analysis of the chiller demonstrated the reversal of the deficiencies related to the initial thermal losses in the condenser 
and evaporator. Again with the design capacity of 101.4 tons at the environmental condition of an outdoor air temperature of 
95 degrees F the normalized capacity design rating is 131 tons. During the post testing period the outdoor environmental 
conditions were much warmer than the baseline by approx: 7 degrees F. During the capacity test the number of compressors 
required to deliver the delta temperature performance of the chiller was reduced from four to two compressors required to 
operate. This demonstrates that after the injection of Permafrost NMR® this chiller can deliver the needed thermal performance 
as a result of the enhancement of the evaporator and condensers ability to transfer thermal energy with much less energy and 
less run time on the compressors thereby offering longer life cycle expectancy. 
Quite simply the demonstration of the thermal enhancement received from PermaFrost NMR® allows this chiller to deliver the 
needed tonnage with less compressors operating since the refrigeration effect of the evaporator and condenser have been 
thermally restored.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the pilot chiller to perform prior to the ECM 
being installed, as well as illustrate the amount of thermal degradation within the 
heat exchangers.
 
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
 
• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU 
 
• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Water Temp – Saturated Evaporator Temp (CH) 
Notes
Following a diagnostic examination to determine the operational condition of the chiller was satisfactory, Baseline M&V data 
was collected and recorded by the M&V team. 400+ runtime hours after installation of the ECM, the M&V team returned to 
take Post M&V measurements in the identical fashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements and associated 
calculations show the amount of capacity and efficiency restored.
The following IPMVP data points were recorded on 1/13/16 using recently calibrated by NIST (National Institutes of 
Standards and Technology) to insure measurement accuracy and in combination with the chiler's control panel. The chiller was 
then treated with PermaFrost NMR® on May 10, 2016 and allowed to run normally until 6/25/16 to ensure the patented 
surface science nanotechnology had ample time to seat into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All post measurements 
were taken at identical incoming water temperatures however the outside air temps were higher in the post by 9.5%. No 
weather adjustments were made.

Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results 
Chiller Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
The Non-Profit Organization has the problem of thermal degradation in its Chillers and HVAC units. The lower operating 
tonnage and COP ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to 
operate numbers. The degraded equipment performance is costing the Non-Profit Organization significant money and wasting 
energy. The pilot chiller is using significantly more energy to operate than when it was new ten years earlier. 
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the chiller in the baseline and 
post testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. 
The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 3.8 operating tons and an 
improvement of 58% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the 
chiller throughout the year. The chiller can now deliver set point using fewer compressors to do so.

Wasted Energy / Cost of HVAC System
The kW/ton is the standard Unit Cost in the HVAC 
industry. It is the HVAC industry’s standard of
determining how much energy is required to create 1 
ton of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you 
reduce your unit cost of cooling you are saving 
regardless of how much cooling is required. The chart 
illustrates how much the performance loss in the 
HVAC/R system is costing in wasted energy when it 
is operating. The specific cost to operate this 
HVAC/R system at 100% load as calculated in 
kW/ton before ECM was 1.20 kW/ton.
The specific cost to operate this chiller after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton,  is currently .76
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ 
was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate 
for a 10 year old chiller utilizing R410A refrigerant.

Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the Non-Profit Organization Chiller.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 92.6 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: 1.20 kW/ton * 96.4 tons = 115.7 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 115.7 kW * 5,044 Annual Operating Hrs = 583,591 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 583,591 kWh * $.24 = $140,062
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: .76 kW/ton * 96.4 tons = 73.3 kW
Annual kWh Post: 73.3 kW * 5,044 hours = 369,725 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 369,725 kWh * .24 cents = $88,734
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $140,062 - $88,734 = $51,328
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $51,328 / 12 = $4,277
Initial Payback Period (IPP)
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot chiller: $33,500
Estimated IPP for Non-Profit Organization on the chiller: $33,500 / $4,277 = 7.8 months
Annual Rate of Return = 153%
Return on Investment Over 10 Years = 1,532%
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for 
Non-Profit Organization for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true 
energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in 
the Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller was when operating at the original 
energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to 
run the chiller at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® ECM was installed. This regression analysis is 
the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours or load the chiller will now operate due to 
the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the chiller to reach the internal building set points with increased 
efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.

Non-Profit Organization is Saving More than Just Energy
By treating the pilot chiller with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the current manner in which the Non-Profit Organization 
operates the chiller, it will save approximately 213,866 kWh per year and all the costs associated with those 
savings. From an environmental impact standpoint, Non-Profit Organization is also benefitting the surrounding community of 
Honolulu. Imagine how great the environmental impact will be when Non-Profit Organization moves forward with treating 
all their HVAC/R equipment in all their properties across their portfolio.
The 213,866 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 150 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from 
being released or any of the following:
