Executive Summary \n \nThe purpose of this study is to compare and confirm the test results of AHRI \nStandards efficiency testing at Underwriters Laboratories, Inc (UL) of PermaFrost \nNMR® to verify results under field conditions at 10 cell tower sites in Houston, \nTexas.   \nPermaFrost NMR® is an efficiency restoration chemical that treats the surface of \nmetal. It works the same way on every air conditioner, every time.  Measuring the \nperformance accurately is based on measuring expected variables and the \nmitigation of uncontrolled variables, so forensic based standards field testing \nshould be in line with laboratory testing due to the chemical nature of the \ntechnology.   Major US Telecom requested expanding the testing parameters to include energy \nuse (runtime) under the same weather conditions (where possible) to determine \nenergy savings in situ. Twenty units generated a large enough sample size to help \naccount for uncontrolled variables with a high level of confidence.  Together, these \nmethodologies should help to create additional confidence in the data. \n1. Average kWh savings of 19.4% achieved in field testing across all sites is \ncomparable to the 18% - 22% efficiency gains found in controlled AHRI lab \ntesting by UL (Gold Standard of the HVAC industry). \n2. Runtime was reduced by 18,818 minutes or 18.3% matching UL controlled test \nresults. \n3. Weather conditions (temperature data) in the post were slightly warmer. \nCooling Degree Days (CDDs) in the post were within .2% of baseline. This \nsmall amount of additional work was overcome providing high confidence in \nthe data sets with respect to weather conditions.  \n4. Eight of the ten sites had comparable runtime data sets. Two sites required a \nregression analysis (blue) due to mechanical issues in a couple of units \n(normal) affecting runtimes. The independent kWh and runtime savings \nmatched the EER and kW/ton improvements.  \n5. Runtime reduction equates to a ~19% equipment life extension and \nmaintenance expense reduction. \n6. The forensic study data in this pilot can be used by Major US Telecom to cut additional \nexpenses outside of the focus of this pilot.

Introduction \n \nA selection of twenty (20) consecutive days prior to the implementation of \nPermaFrost NMR® is compared to twenty (20) consecutive days in the Energy \nReporting Period (ERP) or post period. The Energy Reporting Period was selected \nafter ample time was allowed for the treated Bard units to have gestated as \ndetermined by measuring each units compressor run time after the \nnanotechnology had been installed. \n\n\n\n \nThis document is proprietary and confidential to Powertron Global, LLC and is not to be modified, distributed all or in part to any third party \nwithout prior written approval. © Copyright 2023 Powertron Global, LLC. \n \nPowertron Global’s digital F2 monitoring systems were installed on each individual \nHVAC unit (2 per site) at ten (10) selected cell tower building sites (Appendix A). \nThe measurement boundary will be the HVAC equipment itself. The F2 devices \nrecorded data every second on a continual basis. The data is automatically \nuploaded to Powertron’s FMV data gathering platform. Each F2 device is \nequipped with a revenue grade power meter and specific levels of sensor \ntechnology including a variety of temperature, humidity, airflow, and current \nmeasurements (compressor on/off) capabilities. The list of points measured can \nbe found within Appendix B in this report. All measurements were collected to \nprovide the establishment of a confident baseline power consumption and thermal \nperformance as determined by the use of temperature data (CDD). The F2 \nsystems remained attached to the equipment throughout the entire project. \n \nAfter baseline data was established, a total of twenty (20) HVAC units were \ntreated with the proper amount of PermaFrost NMR®, a nanotechnical chemical, \ndesigned to restore any lost cooling capacity because of internal heat exchanger \nlubricant fouling. The goal of the technology is to restore lost efficiency, enhance \ncooling capacity from depleted levels, and to reduce compressor runtime/cycle \ntime periods.  \n \nAccomplishing the deliverance of additional cooling capacity by improving heat \nexchanger performance will reduce the amount of time the compressor must \noperate therefore reducing the amount of total kilowatt hours consumed on a daily \nbasis.   \n \nAfter treatment and required time for the nanotechnology to gestate (up to 500 \ncompressor runtime hours) throughout the refrigeration circuit of each unit, the \nERP or post data gathering was recorded. The ERP data will be compared to the \nbaseline power data taking into account the CDD totals to normalize the results. \n \n \nC. Project Description \n \nThe initial baseline period was conducted on May 11-24 of 2023 but due to the \ndelayed installation of the product, Powertron Global F2 devices captured \nadditional 6 weeks approximately of baseline data (May 25 – July 4). A pivot in the \nselection of the baseline data period was determined to compare pre & post data \nsets with the exact or near exact Cooling Degree Day (CDD) totals for like weather \nconditions. Another important static factor that influenced the data selection was to \ninclude an even number of lead and lag days in both data sets. The Lead/Lag \nsettings on the controllers are set for 1 day allowing the units to alternate each day \nas the lead.  \n \nPowertron was able to use a more compelling and comparable baseline period \nwith external load temperatures and additional days of exposure (data).

Expanding the \nbaseline and post periods to allow for ideal weather comparisons provides higher \nconfidence in the data. \n \nThe installation of PermaFrost NMR occurred on July 5-6, 2023. Immediately after \nthe installation the Bard thermostat controllers were lowered in each tower sites \nbuilding and allowed to run for approximately thirty (30) days uninterrupted to \nspeed up the gestation time required for the nanotechnology to seat itself into the \nmetal surfaces of each unit. The data collected during this period will not be used \nin any analysis. The thermostat controllers were returned to the normal operating \nsettings of 80-degree set point on August 7, 2023. Further gestation was required \nat normal operating conditions in order to produce a proper post data set.  \n \nThe Energy Reporting Period (ERP) was from September 6 to October 3, 2023. \nTwenty (20) consecutive days are used in the post-period to simulate weather \nconditions following product gestation. \n \nD. ECM Description \n \nAs PermaFrost NMR nanotechnology (interior coil surface treatment) is installed \ninto a sealed vapor compression system (Package HVAC Unit), a molecular \ntransformation develops. This transformation displaces layers of lubricating fluids \nthat have been impinged in the evaporator and condenser heat exchanger metal \nsurfaces. When the fluid is displaced, the evaporator and condenser can transfer \nadditional heat energy through the tube walls (thermal restoration). This enables \nthe evaporator to completely dehumidify the air per the unit’s design specifications.  \nWhen more dehumidification is developed, the enthalpy delta is increased. This is \nthe action that increases thermal performance through heat exchanger restoration. \n \n \nAs the capacity increases, the kW/ton decreases by means of mathematical \nfunction, demonstrating PermaFrost NMR’s post-treatment effect lowering the \nelectrical cost of every ton of cooling produced, no matter how many tons are called \nfor at any given time.  \n  \nPermaFrost NMR does not change or alter any unit’s electrical characteristics. This \nchange of performance is purely thermal in nature. \n \n \nE. Measurement & Verification \n \nThe primary objective is to measure the complete power use by each HVAC unit \nutilizing revenue grade power meters directly connected to each unit to measure \npower consumption during both Baseline and Energy Reporting Periods. \nMeasuring overall power consumed by an HVAC system can be realized by \nmeasuring voltage, amperage and power factor. Parameters were measured \ncontinuously every second during all hours for a period of twenty (20) days to \ndevelop a baseline.

Accounting for Uncontrolled Variables using Industry Standards \n \nCell Hut #1 has the most internally generated heat of cell site in this project. It \ncontains approx. 20 antennas along with other standard equipment that give off \nsignificant amounts of heat. Network usage traffic here likely plays a significant roll \nin HVAC usage even more than outdoor air temps.  \n• Node 508 had a leak in the baseline which was reported for repair prior to \nbaseline ERP.  The unit steadily declined in performance and in the \nbaseline and into the post.  Efficiency was improved but the runtime data is \nunreliable.  We did calculate the avoided energy savings in the regression \nfrom efficiency improvements in the site. \n \n \n• Node 507 showed an unexplained improvement in output during the \nextended baseline period that showed a 4-ton unit outputting over 5 tons.  \nHowever baseline data prior to the change gives us reliable data to \ncalculate savings by kW/ton reduction. Regression analysis accounted for \nPermaFrost NMR improvements and removed the influence due to the \noutput anomaly.

It is currently \nstill malfunctioning. It was fixed back in late July but soon malfunctioned again \naround September 1st due to the compressor energizing briefly but then defaults to \nthe evaporator fan only running as if it was in a fan mode. This condition was \nwitnessed and reported to Major US Telecom prior to the installation of the PermaFrost NMR.  \n• The other unit (node 520) handled the entire workload (as planned) and \nexhibited runtime and kWh savings as well energy efficiency improvements \nin the unit. While operating alone, the unit saved 29.1% kwh and runtime. \nBelow are the efficiency improvements for reference. \n \n \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nWe are pleased to conclude that this study confirmed energy savings of +19% and \nthese results fell directly in line with the 18-22% results in UL Laboratory testing. \nThe forensic approach showed comprehensive data accounting for uncontrolled \nvariables and normal rates of equipment failure. This methodology combined with \nkWh use and weather (degrees), provides an accurate savings measurement \nwhen variable interference and comparable data was not available or unreliable.  \nThe complete data set supports the testing requirements of Major US Telecom, AHRI, UL, and \nPowertron Global while allowing more accurate modeling results in diverse \nconditions across a national portfolio.", "tokens": 450, "chars": 2081, "pages": {"start": 11, "end": 12}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_002_chunk_0007", "next_id": "pdf_002_chunk_0009", "content_hash": "sha256:c3b7184c6a8aa7a571b43ea14988f92094ee102f65444138e2ef1824e770f5a0"}
