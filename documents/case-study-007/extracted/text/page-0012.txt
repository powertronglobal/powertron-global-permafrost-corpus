Cell Hut #7 located at 7167-7133 Nelms St. 
Powertron Global discovered that HVAC #1 (node 519) has an ongoing issue that 
prevented it from running properly in the Baseline and in the ERP. It is currently 
still malfunctioning. It was fixed back in late July but soon malfunctioned again 
around September 1st due to the compressor energizing briefly but then defaults to 
the evaporator fan only running as if it was in a fan mode. This condition was 
witnessed and reported to Major US Telecom prior to the installation of the PermaFrost NMR.  
• The other unit (node 520) handled the entire workload (as planned) and 
exhibited runtime and kWh savings as well energy efficiency improvements 
in the unit. While operating alone, the unit saved 29.1% kwh and runtime. 
Below are the efficiency improvements for reference. 
 
 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
We are pleased to conclude that this study confirmed energy savings of +19% and 
these results fell directly in line with the 18-22% results in UL Laboratory testing. 
The forensic approach showed comprehensive data accounting for uncontrolled 
variables and normal rates of equipment failure. This methodology combined with 
kWh use and weather (degrees), provides an accurate savings measurement 
when variable interference and comparable data was not available or unreliable.  
The complete data set supports the testing requirements of Major US Telecom, AHRI, UL, and 
Powertron Global while allowing more accurate modeling results in diverse 
conditions across a national portfolio.
