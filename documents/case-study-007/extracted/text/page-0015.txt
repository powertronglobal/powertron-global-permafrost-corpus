Meter Specifications 
 
 
1. AccuEnergy 1312 Power Meter  
 
AcuRev 1312 provides real-time RMS measurement of the instantaneous 
Voltage, Current, Power, Frequency and Power Factor. All measurements can be 
viewed through the meter display or the AcuRev 1312 Utility Software. The meter 
supports energy parameters such as the reactive and apparent energy with ANSI 
C 12.20 0.5 class and IEC 62053-22 0.5s class revenue grade accuracy. 
 
2. Dwyer O-4 (Outdoor and Ambient Air Temp) 
 
Thermistor temperature sensor +-.22 Thermistor temperature sensor: ±0.22°C 
@ 25°C (±0.4°F @ 77°F); RTD temperature sensor: DIN class B: ±0.3°C @ 0°C 
(±0.54°F @ 32°F). 
 
3. Dwyer AC Current Switches CCS-231150 (Compressor on/off) 
 
Current switch, split core, adjustable set point with min. set point 1.5, normally 
open output. 0-200 A AC. 0.3 A @ 135 VAC/DC; For non-dry contact models: 1 
A @ 240 VAC. 
 
 
4. Dwyer AVUL (Air Velocity) 
 
Simultaneous current and voltage outputs on all models provide universal 
inputs to monitoring equipment while the output range, units, and 0 to 5/10 
VDC, 4-20 mA output. ±(5% of reading + 0.2 m/s) or ±(3% of reading + 0.2 m/s)  
 
 
5. Dwyer RHP-2D1B (Return and Supply RH and Temp) 
 
Duct mount 2% RH/temperature transmitter with 4-20 mA RH output and 
10K @ 25°C thermistor temperature output.
