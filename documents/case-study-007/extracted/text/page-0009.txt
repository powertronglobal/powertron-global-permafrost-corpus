Cell Hut #1 has the most internally generated heat of cell site in this project. It 
contains approx. 20 antennas along with other standard equipment that give off 
significant amounts of heat. Network usage traffic here likely plays a significant roll 
in HVAC usage even more than outdoor air temps.  
• Node 508 had a leak in the baseline which was reported for repair prior to 
baseline ERP.  The unit steadily declined in performance and in the 
baseline and into the post.  Efficiency was improved but the runtime data is 
unreliable.  We did calculate the avoided energy savings in the regression 
from efficiency improvements in the site. 
 
 
• Node 507 showed an unexplained improvement in output during the 
extended baseline period that showed a 4-ton unit outputting over 5 tons.  
However baseline data prior to the change gives us reliable data to 
calculate savings by kW/ton reduction. Regression analysis accounted for 
PermaFrost NMR improvements and removed the influence due to the 
output anomaly.  The energy use was improved 20.5% (adjusted down from 
52% output anomaly)
