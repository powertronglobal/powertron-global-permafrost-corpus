Using that information the total BTUH of \ncooling production can be realized. The objective of measuring overall power \nconsumed by an HVAC/R system can be realized by measuring voltage, \namperage and power factor.  \n \nFor this HVAC/R system, parameters were measured every second during the \nentire duration of this confirmatory test. A period of seven (7) days was selected \nprior to installation of the PermaFrost NMR to develop a scientific baseline. The \nsame was applied to the post reporting period (7 days) after the required \ngestation time was achieved to capture improvements. Data was extracted from \nthe same parameters during all operating hours during both reporting periods. \n \nAn analysis is provided of the seven (7) day periods of performance profiles of \nsubsequent kW/ton, EER and COP are provided in this report. Both the baseline \nand post reporting periods used an outdoor air temperature range of 65-95 \ndegrees Fahrenheit (30 degree temp span) and used a return air temp range of \n65-75 degrees Fahrenheit. A common CFM range was selected of 7600-9200 for \nboth reporting period, which covered the typical operating range of this \nequipment. All data selection criteria can be found at the end of each reporting \nperiod in this report. The baseline captured over 110K samples and the post-\nreporting period captured over 92K samples for comparison. The confidence in \nthis data is high. \n \nTotal BTUH was developed along with total kW consumption by measuring all \nrequired data points (33 points - see appendix for points measured) and entering \nthem into industry best practice engineering formulae. All measurement hardware \nwas certified under NIST or CE standards.

This transformation displaces layers of lubricating fluids that have been \nimpinged in the evaporator and condenser heat exchanger metal surfaces. When \nthe fluid is displaced, the evaporator and condenser can transfer additional heat \nenergy through the tube walls (thermal restoration). This enables the evaporator to  \ncompletely dehumidify the air per the unit’s design specifications.  When more \ndehumidification is developed, the enthalpy (a measure of how many grains of \nmoisture are contained in a pound of air) increases. \n \nIf the CFM and 4.5 remain constant, then it is the effect of PermaFrost NMR®’s \nEnthalpy Delta increase that restores (increases) the lost capacity (Tons).  \n \nIf the tonnage increases, then the kW/ton decreases by means of mathematical \nfunction, demonstrating PermaFrost NMR®’s post-treatment effect lowering the \nelectrical cost of every ton of cooling produced, no matter how many tons are \ncalled for at any given time.  \n  \n \n \n\n\n\n \nThis document is proprietary and confidential to Powertron Global, LLC and is not to be modified, distributed all or in part to any third party \n \n \nPermaFrost NMR® cannot change any unit’s electrical characteristics i.e. \neverything that requires electricity is rated for the required power under different \nloads e.g. compressors and fans.  \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nThe Energy Services Company DX unit confirmatory testing results validate the \nperformance improvements of the treated HVAC/R system and are in line with a \npreviously tested UL (formally Underwriters Laboratories) unit as well as +300 P.E. \nreviewed case studies available upon request.  The results of the confirmatory \ntesting demonstrate the efficacy of PermaFrost NMR® by restoring the evaporator \nand condenser heat transfer capabilities per manufacturer’s design, thereby \nrestoring cooling capacity while lowering the electrical cost per ton of cooling.  \n \n \n \nAPPENDIX \n \n \nI. \nAHU-1 Performance Analysis Summary \nII. \n32 Points Measured \n \n*(raw data files are available and provided) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \nThis document is proprietary and confidential to Powertron Global, LLC and is not to be modified, distributed all or in part to any third party \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAPPENDIX I", "tokens": 786, "chars": 3275, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 7}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_004_chunk_0003", "next_id": "pdf_004_chunk_0005", "content_hash": "sha256:781333834189e5c891e440c2a0cf6173b2c766d201fb17919961f5b3b3e8438f"}
