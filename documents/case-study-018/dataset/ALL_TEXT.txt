INTRODUCTION 
 
 
From August 2019 to the current day at the Burbank location, monitoring 
equipment was implemented to verify the current energy efficiency of one (1) DX 
system using Powertron Global’s FMV energy monitoring platform utilizing the 
latest in the Internet of Things (IoT) cloud based reporting.

The testing is designed to monitor the operation of any system before and after 
installation of PermaFrost NMR® and to verify the amount of capacity restored 
and current kW/ton energy savings improvement.  
 
The monitoring isolates the entry and departure points of the medium being 
cooled and the power being used. By recording the conditions at those entry and 
departure points the overall cooling results can be compared to the overall power 
consumed to quantify the power costs per unit of cooling kW/Ton (kilowatt-per-
ton), EER (Energy Efficiency Ratio), COP (Co-Efficient of Performance), Capacity 
& Enthalpy production.

Method of Procedure for testing: 
 
 
The objective of measuring the overall cooling production of HVAC/R systems 
can be realized by measuring the total energy consumed by the specific unit 
being tested and the total BTUH production of the system then calculating these 
parameters to obtain current capacity, kW/ton, EER (energy efficient ratio) and 
COP (coefficient of performance). Using that information the total BTUH of 
cooling production can be realized. The objective of measuring overall power 
consumed by an HVAC/R system can be realized by measuring voltage, 
amperage and power factor.  
 
For this HVAC/R system, parameters were measured every second during the 
entire duration of this confirmatory test. A period of seven (7) days was selected 
prior to installation of the PermaFrost NMR to develop a scientific baseline. The 
same was applied to the post reporting period (7 days) after the required 
gestation time was achieved to capture improvements. Data was extracted from 
the same parameters during all operating hours during both reporting periods. 
 
An analysis is provided of the seven (7) day periods of performance profiles of 
subsequent kW/ton, EER and COP are provided in this report. Both the baseline 
and post reporting periods used an outdoor air temperature range of 65-95 
degrees Fahrenheit (30 degree temp span) and used a return air temp range of 
65-75 degrees Fahrenheit. A common CFM range was selected of 7600-9200 for 
both reporting period, which covered the typical operating range of this 
equipment. All data selection criteria can be found at the end of each reporting 
period in this report. The baseline captured over 110K samples and the post-
reporting period captured over 92K samples for comparison. The confidence in 
this data is high. 
 
Total BTUH was developed along with total kW consumption by measuring all 
required data points (33 points - see appendix for points measured) and entering 
them into industry best practice engineering formulae. All measurement hardware 
was certified under NIST or CE standards. Engineering formulae was developed 
by AHRI / ASHRAE (American Heating and Refrigeration Institute / American 
Society of Heating Refrigeration & Air Conditioning Engineers): 
 
Kilo-watt (kW) = Volts (V) x Amps (A) x Power Factor (PF) x √3 / 1000 
British Thermal Units (BTU) = CFM x 4.5 x Enthalpy Delta  
Capacity / Tons = BTU / 12,000 
Kilo-watt per Ton (kW/Ton) = kW Energy / Tons (capacity) 
 


═══ PAGE 004 ═══

Co-Efficient of Performance (COP) = 12/kW per ton/ 3.412 
Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) = BTU / Watts 
 
 
 
To Determine Capacity: 
 
 
The entering evaporator air volume, dry bulb temperature and enthalpy are 
measured by the CFM and inlet temperature/enthalpy sensors. The evaporator 
leaving air temperature and enthalpy are measured by the outlet air temperature 
enthalpy sensor. The inlet and outlet enthalpies are subtracted from each other 
resulting in a sum called the Enthalpy delta. This enthalpy delta (∆) is used in the 
shown formula below. Other components of this formula complete the equation. 
These include the volume of air passing through the evaporator (CFM or Cubic 
feet of air per minute) and an engineering standard ratio of 4.5 (Ratio of Standard 
Air) or constant.  The result of this calculation yields the industry standard the 
British Thermal Unit (BTU), which is used to calculate the unit’s capacity in BTU. 
This BTU number is then divided by the constant 12,000 which is to convert to 
refrigeration tons because every 12,000 BTUs equals 1 Ton of HVAC capacity. 
The capacity formula is: 
 
 
CFM x 4.5 x Enthalpy ∆ = BTUs / 12,000 = Tons (capacity) 
 
 
CFM – Cubic Feet per Minute of Air Flow or Air Volume 
4.5 – Ratio of Standard Air (constant) 
Enthalpy ∆ - Enthalpy Delta of the Inlet – Outlet Enthalpy 
BTU – British Thermal Units  
12,000 – every 12,000 BTUs equals 1 Ton (constant) 
 
 
 
Example 
 
4000 (CFM) X 4.5 (Standard Air Ratio) X 8 (Enthalpy Delta) = 144,000 BTU, then 
divide by 12,000 = 12 tons 
 
 
To Determine Electrical Energy Consumption: 
 
Total electrical consumption is measured at the main source of electric service of 
each rooftop unit. This includes, voltage, amperage and power factor and a 
constant of the square root of 3 (√3). This is then divided by 1000 to obtain 
kilowatts. The electrical formula for kilowatt (kW) is: 
 


═══ PAGE 005 ═══

 
This document is proprietary and confidential to Powertron Global, LLC and is not to be modified, distributed all or in part to any third party 
 
kW = V x A x PF x √3 / 1000 
 
V – Voltage 
A – Amperage 
PF – Power Factor 
√3 – Square Root of 3 for 3-phase Input Power 
1000 – constant  
 
 
Example 
 
480 (volts) X 45 (amps) X √3 (phase angle for three phase power only) X 0.90 
(power factor) / 1000 = 33.67 kilowatts  
 
 
To Determine Efficiency: 
 
Divide the measured kilowatts (kW) by the measured tons to obtain kW per ton. 
kW per ton is the industry standard to determine system efficiency.  
 
Example 
 
33.67 kW / 12 tons = 2.80 kilowatts per ton   
 
 
 
  
Technical 
 
 
When PermaFrost NMR® is installed into a unit, a molecular transformation 
develops. This transformation displaces layers of lubricating fluids that have been 
impinged in the evaporator and condenser heat exchanger metal surfaces. When 
the fluid is displaced, the evaporator and condenser can transfer additional heat 
energy through the tube walls (thermal restoration). This enables the evaporator to  
completely dehumidify the air per the unit’s design specifications.  When more 
dehumidification is developed, the enthalpy (a measure of how many grains of 
moisture are contained in a pound of air) increases. 
 
If the CFM and 4.5 remain constant, then it is the effect of PermaFrost NMR®’s 
Enthalpy Delta increase that restores (increases) the lost capacity (Tons).  
 
If the tonnage increases, then the kW/ton decreases by means of mathematical 
function, demonstrating PermaFrost NMR®’s post-treatment effect lowering the 
electrical cost of every ton of cooling produced, no matter how many tons are 
called for at any given time.

PermaFrost NMR® cannot change any unit’s electrical characteristics i.e. 
everything that requires electricity is rated for the required power under different 
loads e.g. compressors and fans.  
 
 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
 
The Energy Services Company DX unit confirmatory testing results validate the 
performance improvements of the treated HVAC/R system and are in line with a 
previously tested UL (formally Underwriters Laboratories) unit as well as +300 P.E. 
reviewed case studies available upon request.  The results of the confirmatory 
testing demonstrate the efficacy of PermaFrost NMR® by restoring the evaporator 
and condenser heat transfer capabilities per manufacturer’s design, thereby 
restoring cooling capacity while lowering the electrical cost per ton of cooling.
