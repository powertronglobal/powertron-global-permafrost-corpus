PermaFrost NMR® cannot change any unit’s electrical characteristics i.e. 
everything that requires electricity is rated for the required power under different 
loads e.g. compressors and fans.  
 
 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
 
The Energy Services Company DX unit confirmatory testing results validate the 
performance improvements of the treated HVAC/R system and are in line with a 
previously tested UL (formally Underwriters Laboratories) unit as well as +300 P.E. 
reviewed case studies available upon request.  The results of the confirmatory 
testing demonstrate the efficacy of PermaFrost NMR® by restoring the evaporator 
and condenser heat transfer capabilities per manufacturer’s design, thereby 
restoring cooling capacity while lowering the electrical cost per ton of cooling.
