INTRODUCTION 
 
 
From August 2019 to the current day at the Burbank location, monitoring 
equipment was implemented to verify the current energy efficiency of one (1) DX 
system using Powertron Global’s FMV energy monitoring platform utilizing the 
latest in the Internet of Things (IoT) cloud based reporting.

The testing is designed to monitor the operation of any system before and after 
installation of PermaFrost NMR® and to verify the amount of capacity restored 
and current kW/ton energy savings improvement.  
 
The monitoring isolates the entry and departure points of the medium being 
cooled and the power being used. By recording the conditions at those entry and 
departure points the overall cooling results can be compared to the overall power 
consumed to quantify the power costs per unit of cooling kW/Ton (kilowatt-per-
ton), EER (Energy Efficiency Ratio), COP (Co-Efficient of Performance), Capacity 
& Enthalpy production.
