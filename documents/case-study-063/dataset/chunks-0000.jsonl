Many industry leading \norganizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age. \nThermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVAC/R equipment that operates as a \nvapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well \ndocumented by the HVAC/R industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal \ndegradation prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times \nand additional kWh consumption.\nThe chiller in this study (pictured below) is \nrepresentative of the portfolio of equipment \noperated by Major Healthcare Provider. If thermal degradation is \npresent in this chiller it is present in the entire \ninventory of equipment. Energy waste can be \ncalculated based on this equipment (portfolio \nrepresentation) and then accurately extrapolated \nacross the entire inventory of equipment.\nThis report is provided to Major Healthcare Provider Permanente Hospital.

The cooling capacity the chiller produces after 11 years in service, before and after the administration \n \n    of the ECM. \n \n2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the chiller can deliver as \n \n    reflected in the kW/ton measurement, before and after the administration of the ECM. \n \n3. The thermal dynamic ability of the chiller to perform in relation to operational design, before and \n \n    after the administration of the ECM.\nMethodology\nThe measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the \nIPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted [Director of Facilities Services] \nof the Major Healthcare Provider, Donogh Mc Sherry of Technology Partner; and Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, \n[Senior Energy Engineer].  \nNotes\nThe boundary of the testing was the chiller and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance \ncalculations is very high.\nThis report is provided to Major Healthcare Provider Permanente Hospital.

The delta of these measurements and associated \ncalculations show the amount of capacity and efficiency restored.\nThe following IPMVP data points were recorded on 6/24/16 using the flow meter recently calibrated by NIST (National \nInstitutes of Standards and Technology) to insure GPM measurement accuracy. The remaining measurements were either \ntaken directly from the chiller’s control panel or recently calibrated Fluke instrumentation. The chiller was then treated with \nPermaFrost NMR® and allowed to run normally until 7/18/16 to ensure the patented surface science nanotechnology had \nample time to seat into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All measurements were taken in an identical manner \nhowever the incoming water temperature was 1.4 deg F higher and the outside air temps were 1.1 deg F higher higher in the \npost.\nThis report is provided to Major Healthcare Provider Permanente Hospital.

This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post \nAnalysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller was when operating at the original energy \nprofile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the \nchiller at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the most \nwidely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours or load the chiller will now operate due to the \nrestored capacity.
