HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report
Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study
The purpose of this study is to verify the industry wide problem of efficiency loss in HVAC/R as projected by 
ASHRAE research and to quantify the amount of money wasted due to this loss. Many industry leading 
organizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age. 
Thermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVAC/R equipment that operates as a 
vapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well 
documented by the HVAC/R industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal 
degradation prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times 
and additional kWh consumption.
The chiller in this study (pictured below) is 
representative of the portfolio of equipment 
operated by Major Healthcare Provider. If thermal degradation is 
present in this chiller it is present in the entire 
inventory of equipment. Energy waste can be 
calculated based on this equipment (portfolio 
representation) and then accurately extrapolated 
across the entire inventory of equipment.

Process
This report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of a water-cooled chiller 
that supports the Major Healthcare Provider Permanente Hospital in Honolulu, HI. 
Detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the pilot chiller before and after 
the installation of the ECM to determine the impact on the three key elements that greatly affect the HVAC 
power bill as they relate to the original design specifications:
 
 
1. The cooling capacity the chiller produces after 11 years in service, before and after the administration 
 
    of the ECM. 
 
2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the chiller can deliver as 
 
    reflected in the kW/ton measurement, before and after the administration of the ECM. 
 
3. The thermal dynamic ability of the chiller to perform in relation to operational design, before and 
 
    after the administration of the ECM.
Methodology
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the 
IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted [Director of Facilities Services] 
of the Major Healthcare Provider, Donogh Mc Sherry of Technology Partner; and Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, 
[Senior Energy Engineer].  
Notes
The boundary of the testing was the chiller and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance 
calculations is very high.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the pilot chiller to perform prior to the 
ECM being installed, as well as illustrate the amount of thermal degradation 
within the heat exchangers.
 
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor * 1.732/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
 
• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU 
 
• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Water Temp – Saturated Evaporator Temp (CH) 
Notes
Following a diagnostic examination to determine the operational condition of the chiller was satisfactory, Baseline M&V data 
was collected and recorded by the M&V team. 400+ runtime hours after installation of the ECM, the M&V team returned to 
take Post M&V measurements in the identical fashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements and associated 
calculations show the amount of capacity and efficiency restored.
The following IPMVP data points were recorded on 6/24/16 using the flow meter recently calibrated by NIST (National 
Institutes of Standards and Technology) to insure GPM measurement accuracy. The remaining measurements were either 
taken directly from the chiller’s control panel or recently calibrated Fluke instrumentation. The chiller was then treated with 
PermaFrost NMR® and allowed to run normally until 7/18/16 to ensure the patented surface science nanotechnology had 
ample time to seat into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All measurements were taken in an identical manner 
however the incoming water temperature was 1.4 deg F higher and the outside air temps were 1.1 deg F higher higher in the 
post.

Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results 
Chiller Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Major Healthcare Provider Permanente Hospital has the problem of thermal degradation in its Chillers and HVAC systems. The 
lower operating tonnage and COP ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance 
and cost to operate numbers. The degraded equipment performance is costing Major Healthcare Provider significant money and 
wasting energy. The pilot chiller is using significantly more energy to operate than when it was new eleven 
years earlier. 
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the chiller in the baseline and 
post testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation.

Wasted Energy / Cost of HVAC System
The kW/ton is the standard Unit Cost in the HVAC
industry. It is the HVAC industry’s standard of
determining how much energy is required to create 1 
ton of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you 
reduce your unit cost of cooling you are saving 
regardless of how much cooling is required. The chart 
illustrates how much the performance loss in the 
HVAC/R system is costing in wasted energy when it 
is operating. The specific cost to operate this 
HVAC/R system at 78% load as calculated in 
kilo-watt per ton was .69 kW/ton.
The specific cost to operate this chiller after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR® at 78% load as 
calculated in kW/ton is now .60
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ 
was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate 
for a 11 year old chiller utilizing R-134A refrigerant.

Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the Major Healthcare Provider Chiller.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 432 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: .69 kW/ton * 492.4 tons = 339.8 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 339.8 kW * 5,669 Annual Operating Hrs = 1,926,326 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 1,926,326 kWh * $.24 = $462,318
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: .60 kW/ton * 492.4 tons = 295.4 kW
Annual kWh Post: 295.4 kW * 5,669 hours = 1,674,623 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 1,674,623 kWh * .24 cents = $401,909
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $462,318 - $401,909 = $60,409
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $51,328 / 12 = $5,034
Initial Payback Period (IPP)
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot chiller: $69,634
Estimated IPP for Major Healthcare Provider on the chiller: $69,634 / $5,034 = 13.8 months
Annual Rate of Return = 86.8%
Return on Investment Over 10 Years = 867.5%
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for 
Major Healthcare Provider for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post 
Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller was when operating at the original energy 
profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the 
chiller at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the most 
widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours or load the chiller will now operate due to the 
restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the chiller to reach the internal building set points with increased 
efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
