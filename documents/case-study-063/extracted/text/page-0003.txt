Process
This report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of a water-cooled chiller 
that supports the Major Healthcare Provider Permanente Hospital in Honolulu, HI. 
Detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the pilot chiller before and after 
the installation of the ECM to determine the impact on the three key elements that greatly affect the HVAC 
power bill as they relate to the original design specifications:
 
 
1. The cooling capacity the chiller produces after 11 years in service, before and after the administration 
 
    of the ECM. 
 
2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the chiller can deliver as 
 
    reflected in the kW/ton measurement, before and after the administration of the ECM. 
 
3. The thermal dynamic ability of the chiller to perform in relation to operational design, before and 
 
    after the administration of the ECM.
Methodology
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the 
IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted [Director of Facilities Services] 
of the Major Healthcare Provider, Donogh Mc Sherry of Technology Partner; and Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, 
[Senior Energy Engineer].  
Notes
The boundary of the testing was the chiller and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance 
calculations is very high.
