Wasted Energy / Cost of HVAC System
The kW/ton is the standard Unit Cost in the HVAC
industry. It is the HVAC industry’s standard of
determining how much energy is required to create 1 
ton of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you 
reduce your unit cost of cooling you are saving 
regardless of how much cooling is required. The chart 
illustrates how much the performance loss in the 
HVAC/R system is costing in wasted energy when it 
is operating. The specific cost to operate this 
HVAC/R system at 78% load as calculated in 
kilo-watt per ton was .69 kW/ton.
The specific cost to operate this chiller after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR® at 78% load as 
calculated in kW/ton is now .60
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ 
was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate 
for a 11 year old chiller utilizing R-134A refrigerant.
