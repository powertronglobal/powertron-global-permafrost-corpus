Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the pilot chiller to perform prior to the 
ECM being installed, as well as illustrate the amount of thermal degradation 
within the heat exchangers.
 
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor * 1.732/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
 
• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU 
 
• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Water Temp – Saturated Evaporator Temp (CH) 
Notes
Following a diagnostic examination to determine the operational condition of the chiller was satisfactory, Baseline M&V data 
was collected and recorded by the M&V team. 400+ runtime hours after installation of the ECM, the M&V team returned to 
take Post M&V measurements in the identical fashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements and associated 
calculations show the amount of capacity and efficiency restored.
The following IPMVP data points were recorded on 6/24/16 using the flow meter recently calibrated by NIST (National 
Institutes of Standards and Technology) to insure GPM measurement accuracy. The remaining measurements were either 
taken directly from the chiller’s control panel or recently calibrated Fluke instrumentation. The chiller was then treated with 
PermaFrost NMR® and allowed to run normally until 7/18/16 to ensure the patented surface science nanotechnology had 
ample time to seat into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All measurements were taken in an identical manner 
however the incoming water temperature was 1.4 deg F higher and the outside air temps were 1.1 deg F higher higher in the 
post.
