Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results 
Chiller Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Major Healthcare Provider Permanente Hospital has the problem of thermal degradation in its Chillers and HVAC systems. The 
lower operating tonnage and COP ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance 
and cost to operate numbers. The degraded equipment performance is costing Major Healthcare Provider significant money and 
wasting energy. The pilot chiller is using significantly more energy to operate than when it was new eleven 
years earlier. 
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the chiller in the baseline and 
post testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation.
