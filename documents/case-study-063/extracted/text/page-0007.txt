Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the Major Healthcare Provider Chiller.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 432 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: .69 kW/ton * 492.4 tons = 339.8 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 339.8 kW * 5,669 Annual Operating Hrs = 1,926,326 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 1,926,326 kWh * $.24 = $462,318
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: .60 kW/ton * 492.4 tons = 295.4 kW
Annual kWh Post: 295.4 kW * 5,669 hours = 1,674,623 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 1,674,623 kWh * .24 cents = $401,909
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $462,318 - $401,909 = $60,409
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $51,328 / 12 = $5,034
Initial Payback Period (IPP)
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot chiller: $69,634
Estimated IPP for Major Healthcare Provider on the chiller: $69,634 / $5,034 = 13.8 months
Annual Rate of Return = 86.8%
Return on Investment Over 10 Years = 867.5%
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for 
Major Healthcare Provider for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post 
Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller was when operating at the original energy 
profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the 
chiller at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the most 
widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours or load the chiller will now operate due to the 
restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the chiller to reach the internal building set points with increased 
efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
