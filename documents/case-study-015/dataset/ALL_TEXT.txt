Energy Performance Report
Pharma Company B

Product Brief
        Our patented surface chemical nanotechnology is a sustainable one-time treatment that lasts for the 
remaining useful life of any type of system in which it’s installed – DX (RTUs, Split Systems, CRAC’s), 
Chillers (including Ammonia Chillers), Heat Pumps, Ice Machines, or Refrigerated Transport. 
PermaFrost NMR® is a Nanotechnology that uses the patented Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) 
technology as its core agent.  When installed into the low side port, the product immediately goes to 
work restoring optimal heat transfer characteristics to the coils by embedding into the microscopic lattice structure of the metal as a thermal transfer agent, forming a passive nano-magnetic film on the surface. This process enhances the conductivity of the metal and creates a permanent thermal coating that maintains optimal heat transfer efficiency for the life of the equipment. 
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity, and 
better refrigerant flow – all of which allows a system to achieve set temperatures quicker and then shut 
off, unload or throttle back. 
The indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment 
include reduced run time, less kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, superior lubrication, 
less metallic wear and longer overall equipment life.

Executive Summary
This report contains specific information regarding the installation of PermaFrost NMR® in a York YKJH 
water-cooled chiller owned by Pharma Company B located in [Connecticut Location].
Eric Newhard (facility manager) and Tim Murphy, two Pharma Company B representatives, managed this pilot at this 
location in [Connecticut Location].
In summary, The Pharma Company B chiller in [Connecticut] 
treated with the PermaFrost NMR® ECM showed 
an 6.0% reduction in kW; a 18.6% (171 tons) 
restoration of operating tonnage in required to 
deliver set point; 20.7% reduction in kW/ton; an 
26.3% improvement in COP; and a 11.1% 
improvement in refrigerant approach.  These 
results are highly significant.
This pilot machine provides chilled water at the measured GPM and now delivers design chilled water 
outlet set point temperature at reduced kWh while increasing tonnage per kW efficiency.  This allows the 
chiller to produce more tonnage while consuming less energy.  The introduction of PermaFrost NMR® has 
restored a significant amount of chilled water capacity to support this facility, which has resulted in much 
lower operational costs.
Based on the data collected, the return on investment (ROI) for this ECM is just 14.4 months.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol IPMVP
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) is used to develop this 
report.  The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and 
Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the 
IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and 
products.
There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize.  They 
are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.
Retrofit Isolation (Option B) is defined as: All parameter measurement with the boundary of the ECM 
(PermaFrost NMR®) as the single source of measurement.  Savings are determined by field measurement of 
the energy use of the energy conservation method affected equipment or system and any performance 
enhancements versus the baseline data.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term 
measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained.  The savings are calculated by 
short-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using 
measurements of proxies of energy use.
The final computation follows the formula below:
Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy
+ - Routine adjustments + - Non-Routine Adjustments

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content of the following report will demonstrate the effects of PermaFrost NMR®’s ability to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces. 
It was determined with Pharma Company B to treat 1 water-cooled chiller.  A diagnostic examination of the 
pilot equipment is implemented to determine if the unit’s operational conditions are satisfactory. Baseline 
measurements will be recorded and then the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® will be injected.  
The product will be allowed 4 weeks to seat itself into the metal surfaces before post measurements were 
taken to establish the efficiency gains. 
The unit was fully loaded during the baseline and the in the Energy Reporting Periods.  The following 
parameters during a five-minute steady state period were recorded:
Chiller kW, Chilled Water Delta T, Condenser Water Delta T, Condensed Liquid Refrigerant Temperature, 
Saturated (Suction) Evaporator Refrigerant Temperature, Operating Tonnage, kW per Ton and COP.
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
•  To determine the kW, voltage, amperage and power factor were recorded using a digital kW meter.  Data 
from that meter is automatically calculated. Those data streams were verified by the manual calculation for 
determining kW energy as:
 
Volts * Amps * .85 * 1.732 / 1000
•  To determine the actual GPM the following formula was utilized:
 
GPM2 = GPM * Measured Pressure Drop (ft) / by Design Pressure Drop (ft) (squared)
•  To determine the Actual Cooling Tons per Hour the following formula was utilized:
 
Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU
•  To determine the Operating kW per Ton the following formula was utilized:
 
Actual kW / Actual Tonnage

•  •  To determine the actual COP the following formula was utilized:
 
12 / kW per ton / 3.412
•  To determine Refrigerant Approach the following formula was utilized:
 
Supply Water Temp – Saturated Evaporator Temp
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP International Performance Measurement and 
Verification Protocol as the M&V plan. The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global’s Senior

Results
The following results are based off of the Baseline Measurement of data and the Energy Reporting Period.
kW per ton Baseline = .69632 kW/ton * 917.4 tons = 638.8 kW
kW per ton Energy Reporting Period = .552 kW/ton * 1088 tons = 600.6 kW
Annual kWh Baseline 638.8 kW * 3,800 hours = 2,427,440 kWh
Annual Cost Baseline = 2,427,440 kWh * .126 cents = $305,857.44
Annual kWh Energy Reporting Period 600.6 kW * 3,800 hours = 2,280 kWh
Annual Cost Energy Reporting Period = 2,280 * .126 cents = $287,567.28
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) = $18,290.16
$18,290.16/ 12 months = $1,524.18 per month / Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed @ $21,932.44 = months
 
ROI = 14.4 months

Conclusion
The improved efficiency (kW per ton) at the unit at full load was 20.7% with a 26.3% improvement in COP. 
There was 171 additional tons restored or 18.6% in operating tonnage. The improvement in the refrigerant 
approach, a measurable thermodynamic enhancement of PermaFrost NMR®, was 11.1%. These results are 
highly significant. This chiller not only provides chilled water at the rated GPM and design chilled water 
outlet temperature at reduced kWh and cost, it also does this at a greater tonnage per kW.  This allows the 
chiller to produce more tonnage at less energy. 
The return on investment for this ECM is 14.4 months.
