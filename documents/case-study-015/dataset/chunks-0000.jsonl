When installed into the low side port, the product immediately goes to \nwork restoring optimal heat transfer characteristics to the coils by embedding into the microscopic lattice structure of the metal as a thermal transfer agent, forming a passive nano-magnetic film on the surface. This process enhances the conductivity of the metal and creates a permanent thermal coating that maintains optimal heat transfer efficiency for the life of the equipment. \nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity, and \nbetter refrigerant flow – all of which allows a system to achieve set temperatures quicker and then shut \noff, unload or throttle back. \nThe indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment \ninclude reduced run time, less kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, superior lubrication, \nless metallic wear and longer overall equipment life.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 485, "chars": 2311, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_021_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:02da42aa4230291e43a04e3e0acb5517351e0d7f40198b9a96de655d1e3a8275"}

These \nresults are highly significant.\nThis pilot machine provides chilled water at the measured GPM and now delivers design chilled water \noutlet set point temperature at reduced kWh while increasing tonnage per kW efficiency.  This allows the \nchiller to produce more tonnage while consuming less energy.  The introduction of PermaFrost NMR® has \nrestored a significant amount of chilled water capacity to support this facility, which has resulted in much \nlower operational costs.\nBased on the data collected, the return on investment (ROI) for this ECM is just 14.4 months.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\nEnergy Science Division\nMeasurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol IPMVP\nThe International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) is used to develop this \nreport.  The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and \nAir-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the \nIPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and \nproducts.\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize.  They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.\nRetrofit Isolation (Option B) is defined as: All parameter measurement with the boundary of the ECM \n(PermaFrost NMR®) as the single source of measurement.  Savings are determined by field measurement of \nthe energy use of the energy conservation method affected equipment or system and any performance \nenhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained.  The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using \nmeasurements of proxies of energy use.\nThe final computation follows the formula below:\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+ - Routine adjustments + - Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval.", "tokens": 808, "chars": 3765, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_021_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_021_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:80cc1463603667954a97677369f6d169540fe2870af52b9f54de900c5ea889c4"}
