Conclusion
The improved efficiency (kW per ton) at the unit at full load was 20.7% with a 26.3% improvement in COP. 
There was 171 additional tons restored or 18.6% in operating tonnage. The improvement in the refrigerant 
approach, a measurable thermodynamic enhancement of PermaFrost NMR®, was 11.1%. These results are 
highly significant. This chiller not only provides chilled water at the rated GPM and design chilled water 
outlet temperature at reduced kWh and cost, it also does this at a greater tonnage per kW.  This allows the 
chiller to produce more tonnage at less energy. 
The return on investment for this ECM is 14.4 months.
