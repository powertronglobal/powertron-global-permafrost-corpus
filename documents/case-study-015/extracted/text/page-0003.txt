Executive Summary
This report contains specific information regarding the installation of PermaFrost NMR® in a York YKJH 
water-cooled chiller owned by Pharma Company B located in [Connecticut Location].
Eric Newhard (facility manager) and Tim Murphy, two Pharma Company B representatives, managed this pilot at this 
location in [Connecticut Location].
In summary, The Pharma Company B chiller in [Connecticut] 
treated with the PermaFrost NMR® ECM showed 
an 6.0% reduction in kW; a 18.6% (171 tons) 
restoration of operating tonnage in required to 
deliver set point; 20.7% reduction in kW/ton; an 
26.3% improvement in COP; and a 11.1% 
improvement in refrigerant approach.  These 
results are highly significant.
This pilot machine provides chilled water at the measured GPM and now delivers design chilled water 
outlet set point temperature at reduced kWh while increasing tonnage per kW efficiency.  This allows the 
chiller to produce more tonnage while consuming less energy.  The introduction of PermaFrost NMR® has 
restored a significant amount of chilled water capacity to support this facility, which has resulted in much 
lower operational costs.
Based on the data collected, the return on investment (ROI) for this ECM is just 14.4 months.
