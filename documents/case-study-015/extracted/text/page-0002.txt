Product Brief
        Our patented surface chemical nanotechnology is a sustainable one-time treatment that lasts for the 
remaining useful life of any type of system in which it’s installed – DX (RTUs, Split Systems, CRAC’s), 
Chillers (including Ammonia Chillers), Heat Pumps, Ice Machines, or Refrigerated Transport. 
PermaFrost NMR® is a Nanotechnology that uses the patented Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) 
technology as its core agent.  When installed into the low side port, the product immediately goes to 
work restoring optimal heat transfer characteristics to the coils by embedding into the microscopic
lattice structure of the metal as a thermal transfer agent, forming a passive nano-magnetic film on
the surface. This process enhances the conductivity of the metal and creates a permanent thermal
coating that maintains optimal heat transfer efficiency for the life of the equipment. 
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity, and 
better refrigerant flow – all of which allows a system to achieve set temperatures quicker and then shut 
off, unload or throttle back. 
The indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment 
include reduced run time, less kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, superior lubrication, 
less metallic wear and longer overall equipment life.
