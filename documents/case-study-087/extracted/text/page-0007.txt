Energy Reporting Period (Post)
The identical IPMVP data recordings from the baseline were recorded on 10/6/2012 using the same 
recently NIST calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy.  The measurements are as follows:
Results
The following are the final calculated performance measurements (detailed below the chart) after 
performing the regression analysis to account to the restored capacity brought about by PermaFrost NMR®.
