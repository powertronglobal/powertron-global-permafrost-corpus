Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to determine a very accurate ROI for 
Real Estate Capital Firm A for implementing this ECM:
Baseline kWh = (5,716 CTW / 1,000) * 3,050 Annual Operating Hrs = 17,434 kWh
Baseline Cost To Run = 17,434 kWh * $.095 = $1,656
Regression Analysis is then used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Pilot Unit      
Adjusted Base Tonnage = 4.95 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted Total Watts = 1,351 WPT * 4.95 tons = 6,687 TW
Adjusted Base kWh = (6,687 TW / 1,000) * 3,050 Annual Operating Hrs = 20,395 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM = 20,395 kWh * $.095 = $1,938
Post ECM kWh = (4,886 NTW / 1,000) * 3,050 Annual Operating Hrs = 14,902 kWh
Cost to Run After ECM = 14,902 kWh * $.095 = $1,416
Cost Savings per Month = ($1,938 - $1,416) / 12 = $43.50
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed @ $625 / $43.50 = 14.4
 
ROI = 14.4 months
