Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to determine a very accurate ROI for 
Real Estate Capital Firm A for implementing this ECM:
Baseline kWh = (6,004 CTW / 1,000) * 3,050 Annual Operating Hrs = 18,312 kWh
Baseline Cost To Run = 18,312 kWh * $.095 = $1,740
Regression Analysis is then used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Pilot Unit    
Adjusted Base Tonnage = 4.56 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted Total Watts = 1,387 WPT * 4.56 tons = 6,325 TW
Adjusted Base kWh = (6,325 TW/1,000) * 3,050 Annual Operating Hrs = 19,291 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM = 19,291 kWh * $.095 = $1,833
Post ECM kWh = (5,155 NTW / 1,000) * 3,050 Annual Operating Hrs = 15,723 kWh
Cost to Run After ECM = 15,723 kWh * $.095 = $1,494
Cost Savings per Month = ($1,833 - $1,494) / 12 = $28.25
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed @ $625 / $28.25 = 22.1
 
ROI = 22.1 months
