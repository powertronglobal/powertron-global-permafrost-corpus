The two 5-ton HVAC Equipment Manufacturer packaged rooftop units supporting the facility \nuse R-22 refrigerant.  Both of the pilot units were installed in June of 2004 and are estimated to run \napproximately 3,050 hours per year. Immediately following the baseline testing, both units were treated \nwith five ounces of the PermaFrost NMR® product specially formulated for R-22 DX systems.  \nSince there were no other ECM’s going on during this pilot project, the improvement in efficiency and \nrestored capacity gained directly at the units is solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The pilot \nunits now provide colder and drier supply air and more Btu’s while using less power.  This greater \noperational efficiency is due to the restoration of the heat transfer ability of the evaporator and condenser \ncoils, less metal to metal friction and improved refrigerant flow.  \nSince the outside air temperatures and humidity were almost identical in the baseline and post reporting \nperiods, as were the return air temperatures from inside the space, no adjustment for weather were made to \nthe resulting numbers.\nFollowing treatment with PermaFrost NMR® the two pilot units showed an average 22.7% reduction in \nTotal Watts and a 14.7% reduction in Amps while at the same time producing an increase in capacity of \n11,340 Btuh or 11.1% more tonnage.  The units also showed a substantial reduction in Watts/Ton of 22.7% \nand an 11.1% improvement in the Enthalpy Delta.  Additionally, the two pilot units showed an average of \n29.7% improvement in EER, which is another measurable way to view the thermodynamic enhancement of \nthe PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result of the average ECM improvements is an ROI to Real Estate Capital Firm A of just \n18.3 months. The tables of data and financial calculations are available for review at the end of this report.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 694, "chars": 3072, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_085_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:3aacb79fb96f43770f522ce06d68bed65e8b939b5fcf9cbe4c91344616821d5a"}

A \nsustainable, one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining \nlife of any type of system in which it is installed – DX (direct expansion air and chilled water systems), \nChillers (screw, reciprocating, scroll and centrifugal), heat pumps, ice making equipment.  Specialized \napplications include computer room cooling and dehumidification systems, chiller plants (water and \nice production applications), domestic and industrial refrigeration (ammonia low and ultra low \ntemperature), air-cooled single application water chillers and split and package rooftop HVAC \nequipment.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and \nimproved refrigerant velocity – all of which allows a system to achieve set point temperatures in a more \nrapid fashion which reduces system loading and operating periods.  The indirect benefits resulting \nfrom the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less \nkW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, less metallic wear, longer overall equipment life and \na reduced carbon footprint for Real Estate Capital Firm A.\nEnergy Science Division\nOIL BUILD-UP\nOIL REMOVED\nBEFORE TREATMENT\nAFTER TREATMENT\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 441, "chars": 2087, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_085_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_085_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:3a78928b9582ecfbdba878982dec8cf80393f48303bcbc0bfd9c8b584155e9fe"}

The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and \nAir-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the \nIPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and \nproducts.\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize.  They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.  Option B is \ndefined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single \nsource of measurement.  Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM \naffected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained.  The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using \nmeasurements of proxies of energy use. \nThe final computation follows the formula:\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 435, "chars": 2130, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_085_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_085_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:07bec20dd59f6f934d3b3a8d82c614c7f6a66c513047d7c4b5a7bacbc805e8a6"}
