Real Estate Capital Firm A PermaFrost NMR® Performance Report
Two Rooftop Packaged Units in Las Vegas Oﬃce Park
October 7, 2012
Executive Summary
        This report contains specific information regarding the detailed forensic performance testing (outlined 
later in this report) of the energy control measure (ECM) PermaFrost NMR® in Suite 170 in Building 6 of the 
Office Park A in Las Vegas, NV.  The two 5-ton HVAC Equipment Manufacturer packaged rooftop units supporting the facility 
use R-22 refrigerant.  Both of the pilot units were installed in June of 2004 and are estimated to run 
approximately 3,050 hours per year. Immediately following the baseline testing, both units were treated 
with five ounces of the PermaFrost NMR® product specially formulated for R-22 DX systems.  
Since there were no other ECM’s going on during this pilot project, the improvement in efficiency and 
restored capacity gained directly at the units is solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The pilot 
units now provide colder and drier supply air and more Btu’s while using less power.  This greater 
operational efficiency is due to the restoration of the heat transfer ability of the evaporator and condenser 
coils, less metal to metal friction and improved refrigerant flow.  
Since the outside air temperatures and humidity were almost identical in the baseline and post reporting 
periods, as were the return air temperatures from inside the space, no adjustment for weather were made to 
the resulting numbers.
Following treatment with PermaFrost NMR® the two pilot units showed an average 22.7% reduction in 
Total Watts and a 14.7% reduction in Amps while at the same time producing an increase in capacity of 
11,340 Btuh or 11.1% more tonnage.  The units also showed a substantial reduction in Watts/Ton of 22.7% 
and an 11.1% improvement in the Enthalpy Delta.  Additionally, the two pilot units showed an average of 
29.7% improvement in EER, which is another measurable way to view the thermodynamic enhancement of 
the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result of the average ECM improvements is an ROI to Real Estate Capital Firm A of just 
18.3 months. The tables of data and financial calculations are available for review at the end of this report.

Product Brief
         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control 
Measure (ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) technology as its core agent.  A 
sustainable, one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining 
life of any type of system in which it is installed – DX (direct expansion air and chilled water systems), 
Chillers (screw, reciprocating, scroll and centrifugal), heat pumps, ice making equipment.  Specialized 
applications include computer room cooling and dehumidification systems, chiller plants (water and 
ice production applications), domestic and industrial refrigeration (ammonia low and ultra low 
temperature), air-cooled single application water chillers and split and package rooftop HVAC 
equipment.
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and 
improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allows a system to achieve set point temperatures in a more 
rapid fashion which reduces system loading and operating periods.  The indirect benefits resulting 
from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less 
kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, less metallic wear, longer overall equipment life and 
a reduced carbon footprint for Real Estate Capital Firm A.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocols (IPMVP) are used to develop this 
report.  The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and 
Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the 
IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and 
products.
There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize.  They 
are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.  Option B is 
defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single 
source of measurement.  Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM 
affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term 
measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained.  The savings are calculated by 
short-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using 
measurements of proxies of energy use. 
The final computation follows the formula:

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces. 
A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the unit’s operational 
conditions were satisfactory.  Baseline measurements were recorded and then the proper amount and type 
of PermaFrost NMR® was injected.  The product was then allowed four (4) weeks to seat itself into the 
metal surfaces before post measurements were taken again to establish the efficiency gains. 
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP International Performance Measurement and 
Verification Protocol as the M&V plan.  The measurements and final calculations were performed and 
certified by Powertron Global’s Senior Energy Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer], ME/CEM/CMC/CMVP.
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of .9 /1000 (for Single Phase)
 
Delta T = Return Air DB – Supply Air DB
 
Enthalpy = Return Air WB Deg. F and Supply Air WB Deg. F converted to Enthalpy
 
Actual Btuh Capacity = Measured CFM * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta (Baseline – Post) 
 
System Eﬃciency % = Actual Coil Capacity Btuh / Nominal Coil Capacity Btuh
 
EER = Btuh / Adjusted Watts

Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to determine a very accurate ROI for 
the Real Estate Capital Firm A for implementing this ECM:
Baseline kWh = (6,004 CTW / 1,000) * 3,050 Annual Operating Hrs = 18,312 kWh
Baseline Cost To Run = 18,312 kWh * $.095 = $1,740
Regression Analysis is then used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Pilot Unit    
Adjusted Base Tonnage = 4.56 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted Total Watts = 1,387 WPT * 4.56 tons = 6,325 TW
Adjusted Base kWh = (6,325 TW/1,000) * 3,050 Annual Operating Hrs = 19,291 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM = 19,291 kWh * $.095 = $1,833
Post ECM kWh = (5,155 NTW / 1,000) * 3,050 Annual Operating Hrs = 15,723 kWh
Cost to Run After ECM = 15,723 kWh * $.095 = $1,494
Cost Savings per Month = ($1,833 - $1,494) / 12 = $28.25
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed @ $625 / $28.25 = 22.1
 
ROI = 22.1 months
