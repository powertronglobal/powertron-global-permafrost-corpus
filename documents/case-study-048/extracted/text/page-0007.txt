Cost to Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer for Lost Eﬃciency
Left uncorrected, the chiller system with its reduced level of performance is costing (in money) an additional 
11.2% more than it would if it were running at the design specification. Extrapolated across the Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer 
inventory of chiller equipment, this adds up to a significant waste in money and energy resources.
Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer was wasting over $23,664 a year by not correcting this problem in this chiller.
