The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer Chiller.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 702.7 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: .587 kW/ton * 747.4 tons = 438.7 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 438.7 kW * 4,000 Annual Operating Hrs = 1,754,800 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 1,754,800 kWh * $.12 = $210,576
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: .521 kW/ton * 747.4 tons = 389.4 kW
Annual kWh Post: 389.4kW * 4,000 hours = 1,557,600 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 1,557,600 kWh * .12 cents = $186,912
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $210,576 - $186,912 = $23,664
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $23,664 / 12 = $1,972
Return On Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot chiller: $20,250
Estimated ROI Period for Major US Theater Chain on three RTUs: $20,250 / $1,972 = 10.3 months
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period 
for Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true 
energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended 
in the Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems was when operating at the 
original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the 
revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® ECM was installed. This 
regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the systems will 
now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the internal building set 
points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
