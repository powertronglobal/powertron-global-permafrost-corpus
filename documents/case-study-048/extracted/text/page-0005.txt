Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Chiller Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer has the problem of thermal degradation in its HVAC/R units. The lower operating tonnage and COP 
ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. The 
degraded equipment performance is costing Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer significant money and wasting energy. The equipment is 
using significantly more kWh to operate than it used when it was new. 
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the chiller in the baseline and post 
testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® 
ECM resulted in a restoration of 44.7 operating tons and an average improvement of 12.7% in Coefficient of 
Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the chiller throughout the year. The York chiller 
treated has a nominal capacity of 1,000 tons at 100% load and 2,400 gallons per minute (GPM) flow through the 
evaporator. The chiller used in this pilot was tested at 70% load with a GPM of 2,675. This scenario creates a 
type of false-positive tonnage amount of 784 tons but since normal operations were not to be changed for the 
pilot, the emphasis here is on the delta between baseline and post.
