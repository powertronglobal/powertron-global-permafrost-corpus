HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report

Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study

The purpose of this study is to verify the industry wide problem of efficiency loss in HVAC/R as projected by

ASHRAE research and to quantify the amount of money wasted due to this loss. Many industry leading

organizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age.

Thermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVACR equipment that operates as a

vapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well

documented by the HVACR industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal degradation

prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times and additional

kWh consumption.

The chiller in this study is representative of a great majority of the portfolio of equipment operated by Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer.

If thermal degradation is present in this chiller it is present in the entire inventory of equipment. Energy waste

can be calculated based on this equipment (portfolio representation) and then accurately extrapolated across the

entire inventory of equipment.

Process

This report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of one of four chillers that

support the Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer [New Jersey Facility] in [New Jersey Location].

Detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the pilot chiller before and after

the installation of the ECM to determine the impact on the three key elements that greatly affect Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer’s

HVAC power bill as they relate to the original design specifications:

1.  The cooling capacity the chiller is capable of producing after 13+ years in service.

2.  The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the chiller is delivering as

reflected in the kW/ton measurement.

3.  The thermal dynamic ability of the chiller to still perform at or close to operational design.

Methodology

The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the

IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team was led by Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer’s

 Testing Manager, [Client Representative], P.E., was supported by Commercial Real Estate Services’s Michael

Graziano, Facility Manager and Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer].

Notes

The chiller tested is one of the most efficient types of chillers York manufactures. Both the baseline and post measurements

were taken with outside air temperatures of 63 and 65 respectfully. The effect of this slight difference in temperature as

well as a similar slight difference in incoming condenser water from the tower are both within the industry-accepted

margin of error and thereby considered insignificant in terms of overall results.

Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer’s repeatable management of the chiller plant during the trial provided more than an adequate heat load on the

facility to ensure the chiller would remain running during the actual data collection period.

The boundary of the testing was the chiller and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance

calculations is very high.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)

The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the three pilot RTUs to perform prior to

the ECM being installed, as well as illustrate the thermal degradation that naturally occurs in heat exchangers over time.

The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan.

The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:

• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase)

• Ton = (Airflow * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta) / 12,000

• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage

• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)

• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU

• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Water Temp – Saturated Evaporator Temp (CH)

Notes

Following a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to determine the operational condition of the systems was

satisfactory, Baseline M&V data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. 400+ runtime hours after installation of

the ECM, the M&V team returned on a very similar weather day to the Baseline to take Post M&V measurements in the

identical fashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements and associated calculations show the amount of

capacity restored.

The following IPMVP data points were recorded on 5 May 2014 using recently calibrated devices by NIST (National

Institutes of Standards and Technology) to insure measurement accuracy. The chiller was then treated with PermaFrost

NMR® on the same day and allowed to run at greater than 90% load until 23 May 2014 to ensure the patented surface

science nanotechnology had ample time to seat into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All measurements were

taken at 70% load and at similar outdoor air temperatures.

The collection of the data in both the baseline and post periods was collected by Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer with participation by Commercial Real Estate Services and Powertron Global®. The measurements are listed below.

Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results

Chiller Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM

Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer has the problem of thermal degradation in its HVAC/R units. The lower operating tonnage and COP

ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. The

degraded equipment performance is costing Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer significant money and wasting energy. The equipment is

using significantly more kWh to operate than it used when it was new.

The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the chiller in the baseline and post

testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. The implementation of PermaFrost NMR®

ECM resulted in a restoration of 44.7 operating tons and an average improvement of 12.7% in Coefficient of

Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the chiller throughout the year. The York chiller

treated has a nominal capacity of 1,000 tons at 100% load and 2,400 gallons per minute (GPM) flow through the

evaporator. The chiller used in this pilot was tested at 70% load with a GPM of 2,675. This scenario creates a

type of false-positive tonnage amount of 784 tons but since normal operations were not to be changed for the

pilot, the emphasis here is on the delta between baseline and post.

Recovered Wasted Energy with ECM -  Chiller

The chart to the right illustrates the performance

restoration the ECM created in the treated chiller. The

average cost to operate this chiller before it was

treated with PermaFrost NMR® as calculated in

kW/ton was .587.

The specific cost to operate this chiller after it was

treated with PermaFrost NMR® as calculated in

kW/ton is currently .521.

The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ

was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of

performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate

for a 12 year old chiller. The post results are also in

line with the average improvement savings shown

over more than 120,000 installations globally.

Notes

The efficiency and capacity restored is significant and within the expected range for this type of equipment. However, the

actual efficiency and capacity restored is lower than the historical statistical average.

Lower than expected restoration can occur if the unit is :

1   Extremely efficient (statistical possibility)

2.  Has lower than expected total runtime (unit has not fully degraded in efficiency yet therefore it cannot be restored)

3.  The improper amount of PermaFrost NMR® was not installed (incorrect oil charge information)

On further review (because of the abnormality), we identified the oil charge to be 20 gallons versus the reported 12-13

gallons given by the Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer staff. Though still significant, this improper oil charge identification most likely caused the

lower than historically expected efficiency returns. Once the missing amount PermaFrost NMR® is installed and the

chiller is allowed to run another 350+ hours, additional M&V measurements will show the maximum amount of restored

capacity.

Cost to Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer for Lost Eﬃciency

Left uncorrected, the chiller system with its reduced level of performance is costing (in money) an additional

11.2% more than it would if it were running at the design specification. Extrapolated across the Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer

inventory of chiller equipment, this adds up to a significant waste in money and energy resources.

Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer was wasting over $23,664 a year by not correcting this problem in this chiller.

Return On Investment

The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR®

Post measurement period for the Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer Chiller.

Baseline Energy Consumption

Baseline Tonnage: 702.7 tons

Adjusted kW Baseline: .587 kW/ton * 747.4 tons = 438.7 kW

Adjusted Baseline kWh: 438.7 kW * 4,000 Annual Operating Hrs = 1,754,800 kWh

Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 1,754,800 kWh * $.12 = $210,576

Post Energy Consumption

kW Post: .521 kW/ton * 747.4 tons = 389.4 kW

Annual kWh Post: 389.4kW * 4,000 hours = 1,557,600 kWh

Annual Cost Post: 1,557,600 kWh * .12 cents = $186,912

Savings Per Year

Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $210,576 - $186,912 = $23,664

Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $23,664 / 12 = $1,972

Return On Investment

Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot chiller: $20,250

Estimated ROI Period for Major US Theater Chain on three RTUs: $20,250 / $1,972 = 10.3 months

Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period

for Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true

energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended

in the Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems was when operating at the

original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the

revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® ECM was installed. This

regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the systems will

now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the internal building set

points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
