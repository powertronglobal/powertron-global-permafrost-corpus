Many industry leading \norganizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age. \nThermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVACR equipment that operates as a \nvapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well \ndocumented by the HVACR industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal degradation \nprevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times and additional \nkWh consumption.\nThe chiller in this study is representative of a great majority of the portfolio of equipment operated by Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer. \nIf thermal degradation is present in this chiller it is present in the entire inventory of equipment. Energy waste \ncan be calculated based on this equipment (portfolio representation) and then accurately extrapolated across the \nentire inventory of equipment.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 535, "chars": 2555, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_049_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:45522a319cde4737044f3113eee4c4f53f871f1f4ec69bf1455ba54884b663f9"}

The cooling capacity the chiller is capable of producing after 13+ years in service. \n2.  The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the chiller is delivering as \n     reflected in the kW/ton measurement. \n3.  The thermal dynamic ability of the chiller to still perform at or close to operational design.\nMethodology\nThe measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the \nIPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team was led by Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer’s \n Testing Manager, [Client Representative], P.E., was supported by Commercial Real Estate Services’s [Facility Manager], Facility Manager and Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer].  \nNotes \nThe chiller tested is one of the most efficient types of chillers York manufactures. Both the baseline and post measurements \nwere taken with outside air temperatures of 63 and 65 respectfully. The effect of this slight difference in temperature as \nwell as a similar slight difference in incoming condenser water from the tower are both within the industry-accepted \nmargin of error and thereby considered insignificant in terms of overall results.  \nGlobal Telecom Equipment Manufacturer’s repeatable management of the chiller plant during the trial provided more than an adequate heat load on the \nfacility to ensure the chiller would remain running during the actual data collection period. \nThe boundary of the testing was the chiller and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance \ncalculations is very high.\n \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 548, "chars": 2798, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_049_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_049_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:4baa09fc7ae3cf0899f534c2a48b57fde6711ba6cb054266b27f4caa601a9934"}

The delta of these measurements and associated calculations show the amount of \ncapacity restored.\nThe following IPMVP data points were recorded on 5 May 2014 using recently calibrated devices by NIST (National \nInstitutes of Standards and Technology) to insure measurement accuracy. The chiller was then treated with PermaFrost \nNMR® on the same day and allowed to run at greater than 90% load until 23 May 2014 to ensure the patented surface \nscience nanotechnology had ample time to seat into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers.

The lower operating tonnage and COP \nratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. The \ndegraded equipment performance is costing Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer significant money and wasting energy. The equipment is \nusing significantly more kWh to operate than it used when it was new. \nThe performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the chiller in the baseline and post \ntesting periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® \nECM resulted in a restoration of 44.7 operating tons and an average improvement of 12.7% in Coefficient of \nPerformance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the chiller throughout the year. The York chiller \ntreated has a nominal capacity of 1,000 tons at 100% load and 2,400 gallons per minute (GPM) flow through the \nevaporator. The chiller used in this pilot was tested at 70% load with a GPM of 2,675. This scenario creates a \ntype of false-positive tonnage amount of 784 tons but since normal operations were not to be changed for the \npilot, the emphasis here is on the delta between baseline and post.  \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 685, "chars": 2711, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_049_chunk_0003", "next_id": "pdf_049_chunk_0005", "content_hash": "sha256:b5b39bd33ee4af0846bc5ffb17fc9e75a42ace9774736377aa717a91999e19d1"}

The \naverage cost to operate this chiller before it was \ntreated with PermaFrost NMR® as calculated in \nkW/ton was .587.\nThe specific cost to operate this chiller after it was \ntreated with PermaFrost NMR® as calculated in \nkW/ton is currently .521.\nThe higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ \nwas expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of \nperformance efficiency and cost to operate estimate \nfor a 12 year old chiller. The post results are also in \nline with the average improvement savings shown \nover more than 120,000 installations globally.\nNotes \nThe efficiency and capacity restored is significant and within the expected range for this type of equipment. However, the \nactual efficiency and capacity restored is lower than the historical statistical average. \nLower than expected restoration can occur if the unit is :\n1   Extremely efficient (statistical possibility)  \n2.  Has lower than expected total runtime (unit has not fully degraded in efficiency yet therefore it cannot be restored)\n3.  The improper amount of PermaFrost NMR® was not installed (incorrect oil charge information) \nOn further review (because of the abnormality), we identified the oil charge to be 20 gallons versus the reported 12-13 \ngallons given by the Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer staff. Though still significant, this improper oil charge identification most likely caused the \nlower than historically expected efficiency returns.

ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems was when operating at the \noriginal energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the \nrevised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® ECM was installed. This \nregression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the systems will \nnow operate due to the restored capacity.
