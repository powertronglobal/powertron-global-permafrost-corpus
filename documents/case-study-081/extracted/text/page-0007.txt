Recovered Wasted Energy with ECM -  Chiller
The chart to the right illustrates the performance
restoration PermaFrost NMR® created in the 
treated chiller. The average cost to operate this 
chiller before it was treated with PermaFrost NMR®,
as calculated in kWE/kWR, was 0.24.
The specific cost to operate this chiller after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kWE/kWR, is currently 0.17.
The baseline kWE/kWR ratings measured in-situ were consistent within the expected range when 
compared to the ASHRAE loss of performance efficiency and cost to operate estimations for this fifteen (15) 
year old chiller with this amount of annual operating hours. The post results are also in line with the 
average improvement savings shown over more than 125,000 installations globally.
