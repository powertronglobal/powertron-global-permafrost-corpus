Return On Investment
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the Major South African Bank Headquarters.
 
Baseline Energy Consumption
Adjusted Baseline Capacity: 704.28 kWR
Adjusted kW Baseline: 0.24 kWE /kWR * 704.28 kWR = 169.03 kWE
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 169.03 kWE * 4,380 Annual Operating Hrs = 740,351 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 740,351 kWh * R1.05 = R777,369
 
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: 0.17 kWE /kWR * 704.28 kWR = 119.73 kWE
Annual kWh Post: 119.73 kWE * 4,380 hours = 524,417 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 524,417 kWh * R1.05 = R550,638
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: R777,369 – R550,638 = R252,952
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: R252,952 / 12 = R21,079
 
Initial Payback Period
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot chiller: R214,200
Estimated Initial Payback Period on the chiller: R214,200 / R21,079 = 10.2 months
Total kWh saved by treating this chiller = 215,934 kWh
 
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period 
for the Major South African Bank Headquarters implementing PermaFrost NMR®, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate 
the true energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh 
expended in the Avoided Energy Reporting (Post) Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run 
the systems was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available 
tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the 
PermaFrostNMR® was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the 
reduced number of hours the systems will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the 
systems to reach the internal building set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand 
loading.
