HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Cost to Major South African Bank to Operate the Chiller Baseline vs Post
The degraded capacity of the Chiller prior to PermaFrost NMR® being implemented was costing Major South African Bank a 
similar amount in the way of wasted energy each hour the chiller was operating. The average cost to operate 
the pilot chiller as calculated in kWE/kWR was 0.24 in the Baseline. When new, the kWE/kWR rating for units 
like these usually ranges from 0.16 – 0.17 kW/kWR when the proper sized piping is used.
 
The restored average kW/kWR rating following the ECM is now 0.17. This represents a 29.2% reduction in 
energy costs from the baseline for every kWR of cooling produced. This will result in an initial payback period 
(IPP) to Major South African Bank of 10.2 months. These accumulated savings will greatly reduce the eventual CapEx costs to 
replace the chillers when they finally reach the end of their useful life.
