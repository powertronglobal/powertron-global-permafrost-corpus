HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report

Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study

Thermal degradation is well documented by the

American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air

Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) and the original

equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). It is a major cause

of capacity loss in Heating, Ventilation, Air

Conditioning and Refrigeration (HVACR) systems,

preventing them from operating at the original design

efficiency soon after initial installation in the field.

The purpose of this study is to verify the effectiveness of the PermaFrost NMR® Energy Conservation Measure

(ECM) in the Chiller pictured below at Major South African Bank Headquarters and document the future avoided energy costs

associated with the same.

Summary Results

This comprehensive report contains specific information regarding the performance profile of a 1,203-kWR

chiller at 100% load (721-kWR at 50%) supporting Major South African Bank Headquarters in Sandton, South Africa.

At the conclusion of the pilot, the chiller showed an overall annual 215,934 kWh reduction while increasing the

capacity of the chiller by 35.9% from 518.24 kWR in the baseline to 704.28 kWR in the post. The pilot chiller also

showed a 27.2% reduction in kWEnergy/KWRefrigeration and a 29.2% reduction in annual kW usage. These

efficiency improvements equate to an Initial Payback Period (IPP) of the ECM project for Major South African Bank of 10.2

months.

Further details of the measurements are described in the various sections later in this report. All testing was

conducted by Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer] while being assisted and

witnessed throughout by [Energy and Water Manager] of Major South African Bank and [Plant Engineer] of Property Management Company B. Eldon Van

Houwelingen of HVAC Contractor B supported the data collection process and installed the ECM into the chiller.

Process

This comprehensive report contains specific information regarding the performance profile of a single

water-cooled chiller that supports the Major South African Bank Headquarters. The detailed performance testing (outlined

later in this report) was performed on the chiller before (baseline) and after (post) the installation of

PermaFrost NMR®.

This testing determined the impact on three key elements relating to the original design specifications that

greatly affect the HVAC portion of the Major South African Bank Headquarters power bill. They include:

1. The cooling capacity the chiller is capable of producing after fifteen (15) years in service.

2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling the chiller is delivering as

reflected in the kWEnergy /kWRefrigeration measurement.

3. The thermal dynamic ability of the equipment to still perform at or close to operational design.

Methodology

The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the

IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework.

The baseline day chosen to test the chiller

was an average day temperature and

humidity-wise for the Johannesburg area

in the winter which ensured repeatability

of similar weather for the post testing

measurements. The weather and facility

conditions on both days provided an

adequate heat load on the facility to ensure

the chiller the system would remain 50%

loaded and running during the actual data

collection period. The boundary of the

testing was the chiller and nothing else;

therefore confidence in the accuracy of the

performance calculations is very high.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)

The content detailed in this report will demonstrate the ability of the pilot chiller to perform prior to the ECM

being installed, as well as illustrate the amount of thermal degradation

within the heat exchangers.

Following a diagnostic examination of the pilot chiller to determine the operational condition of the system

was satisfactory, Baseline Measurement and Verification (M&V) data was collected and recorded by the M&V

team. Approximately two (2) months after installation of PermaFrost NMR®, the M&V team returned on a

very similar weather day to the Baseline to take Post M&V measurements in the identical fashion as in the

Baseline. The delta of these measurements and associated calculations show the amount of capacity restored.

The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan.

The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:

• kW = Volts*Amps*Power Factor *√3/1000 (for 3-Phase)

• kWE/kWR = Actual kWEnergy /Actual kWRefrigeration

• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = 1/( kWE / kWR)

• Chilled Water Delta-T = Post – Baseline Chilled Water Leaving Temperature

• Actual Capacity = Evaporator Flow Rate*1*Evaporator Delta-T *4.185

HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results

Cost to Major South African Bank to Operate the Chiller Baseline vs Post

The degraded capacity of the Chiller prior to PermaFrost NMR® being implemented was costing Major South African Bank a

similar amount in the way of wasted energy each hour the chiller was operating. The average cost to operate

the pilot chiller as calculated in kWE/kWR was 0.24 in the Baseline. When new, the kWE/kWR rating for units

like these usually ranges from 0.16 – 0.17 kW/kWR when the proper sized piping is used.

The restored average kW/kWR rating following the ECM is now 0.17. This represents a 29.2% reduction in

energy costs from the baseline for every kWR of cooling produced. This will result in an initial payback period

(IPP) to Major South African Bank of 10.2 months. These accumulated savings will greatly reduce the eventual CapEx costs to

replace the chillers when they finally reach the end of their useful life.

Return On Investment

The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR®

Post measurement period for the Major South African Bank Headquarters.

Baseline Energy Consumption

Adjusted Baseline Capacity: 704.28 kWR
Adjusted kW Baseline: 0.24 kWE /kWR * 704.28 kWR = 169.03 kWE
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 169.03 kWE * 4,380 Annual Operating Hrs = 740,351 kWh

Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 740,351 kWh * R1.05 = R777,369

Post Energy Consumption

kW Post: 0.17 kWE /kWR * 704.28 kWR = 119.73 kWE
Annual kWh Post: 119.73 kWE * 4,380 hours = 524,417 kWh

Annual Cost Post: 524,417 kWh * R1.05 = R550,638

Savings Per Year

Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: R777,369 – R550,638 = R252,952

Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: R252,952 / 12 = R21,079

Initial Payback Period

Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot chiller: R214,200

Estimated Initial Payback Period on the chiller: R214,200 / R21,079 = 10.2 months

Total kWh saved by treating this chiller = 215,934 kWh

Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period

for the Major South African Bank Headquarters implementing PermaFrost NMR®, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate

the true energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh

expended in the Avoided Energy Reporting (Post) Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run

the systems was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available

tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the

PermaFrostNMR® was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the

reduced number of hours the systems will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the

systems to reach the internal building set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand

loading.

Major South African Bank is Saving More than just Energy at its Headquarters

By treating the chiller with PermaFrost NMR® and based on the current manner in which they currently

operate the unit, Major South African Bank will save approximately 215,934 kWh per year and all the costs associated with

those savings. From an environmental impact standpoint, the Major South African Bank Headquarters is also benefitting the

surrounding community. Imagine how great the environmental impact will be when Major South African Bank moves

forward with treating all their HVAC equipment in all their locations across South Africa.

The 215,934 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 149 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from

being released or any of the following:
