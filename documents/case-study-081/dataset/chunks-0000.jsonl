It is a major cause \nof capacity loss in Heating, Ventilation, Air \nConditioning and Refrigeration (HVACR) systems, \npreventing them from operating at the original design \nefficiency soon after initial installation in the field. \nThe purpose of this study is to verify the effectiveness of the PermaFrost NMR® Energy Conservation Measure \n(ECM) in the Chiller pictured below at Major South African Bank Headquarters and document the future avoided energy costs \nassociated with the same.  \nSummary Results\nThis comprehensive report contains specific information regarding the performance profile of a 1,203-kWR \nchiller at 100% load (721-kWR at 50%) supporting Major South African Bank Headquarters in Sandton, South Africa.\nAt the conclusion of the pilot, the chiller showed an overall annual 215,934 kWh reduction while increasing the \ncapacity of the chiller by 35.9% from 518.24 kWR in the baseline to 704.28 kWR in the post. The pilot chiller also \nshowed a 27.2% reduction in kWEnergy/KWRefrigeration and a 29.2% reduction in annual kW usage. These \nefficiency improvements equate to an Initial Payback Period (IPP) of the ECM project for Major South African Bank of 10.2 \nmonths.\nFurther details of the measurements are described in the various sections later in this report. All testing was \nconducted by Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer] while being assisted and \nwitnessed throughout by [Energy and Water Manager] of Major South African Bank and [Plant Engineer] of Property Management Company B.

The detailed performance testing (outlined \nlater in this report) was performed on the chiller before (baseline) and after (post) the installation of \nPermaFrost NMR®. \nThis testing determined the impact on three key elements relating to the original design specifications that \ngreatly affect the HVAC portion of the Major South African Bank Headquarters power bill. They include:\n \n1. The cooling capacity the chiller is capable of producing after fifteen (15) years in service. \n \n2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling the chiller is delivering as \n \n    reflected in the kWEnergy /kWRefrigeration measurement. \n \n3. The thermal dynamic ability of the equipment to still perform at or close to operational design.  \nMethodology\nThe measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the \nIPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework.\n \nThe baseline day chosen to test the chiller \nwas an average day temperature and \nhumidity-wise for the Johannesburg area \nin the winter which ensured repeatability \nof similar weather for the post testing \nmeasurements. The weather and facility \nconditions on both days provided an \nadequate heat load on the facility to ensure \nthe chiller the system would remain 50% \nloaded and running during the actual data \ncollection period.

Approximately two (2) months after installation of PermaFrost NMR®, the M&V team returned on a \nvery similar weather day to the Baseline to take Post M&V measurements in the identical fashion as in the \nBaseline. The delta of these measurements and associated calculations show the amount of capacity restored.\nThe following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. \nThe results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:\n \n• kW = Volts*Amps*Power Factor *√3/1000 (for 3-Phase) \n \n• kWE/kWR = Actual kWEnergy /Actual kWRefrigeration \n \n• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = 1/( kWE / kWR)\n \n• Chilled Water Delta-T = Post – Baseline Chilled Water Leaving Temperature\n \n• Actual Capacity = Evaporator Flow Rate*1*Evaporator Delta-T *4.185\n\n\n\n®\nThis is a report provided to Major South African Bank Headquarters and is conﬁdential and proprietary to Powertron Global®, LLC. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global LLC.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement.\nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the pubic domain without our written approval.\n4\nHVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results\nCost to Major South African Bank to Operate the Chiller Baseline vs Post\nThe degraded capacity of the Chiller prior to PermaFrost NMR® being implemented was costing Major South African Bank a \nsimilar amount in the way of wasted energy each hour the chiller was operating. The average cost to operate \nthe pilot chiller as calculated in kWE/kWR was 0.24 in the Baseline. When new, the kWE/kWR rating for units \nlike these usually ranges from 0.16 – 0.17 kW/kWR when the proper sized piping is used.\n \nThe restored average kW/kWR rating following the ECM is now 0.17. This represents a 29.2% reduction in \nenergy costs from the baseline for every kWR of cooling produced. This will result in an initial payback period \n(IPP) to Major South African Bank of 10.2 months.
