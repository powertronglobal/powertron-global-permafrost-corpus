Highlights of the Study
When comparing the pilot cell tower cooling system before and four weeks after PermaFrost NMR® was installed, 
below are some of the highlights of the study:
 
• When initially tested, the pilot system was producing 2.35 tons of cooling. Four weeks after installation, 
 
   the cooling capacity was restored by .48 tons or 20.4% to 2.83 tons. 
 
• The overall cost to produce each ton of cooling on the pilot system dropped 25.4% from 2.01 kW/ton 
 
   in the baseline to 1.5 kW/ton four weeks after installation of the ECM. This means that for every ton of 
 
   cooling the pilot system is asked to produce, Regional Telecom is spending 25.4% less money to do so.
 
• The projected annual kWh’s were reduced by 25.3% from 17,070 to 12,750.
 
• The conditions inside the cell tower shelter remained constant at 73 degrees while the cooling system 
 
   ran less but produced more tonnage. 
 
• The average kW dropped 10% from 4.72 in the baseline to 4.25 in the post when comparing multiple 
 
   hour-long blocks of time under similar outdoor air temperatures affecting the condensing units. The 
 
   true effect of these savings over time are further explained in the regression analysis.
The cell tower cooling system involved in the study is recorded as follows:
 
Bard, Mfg date: 2004, R22, Nominal 3-tons, 240 volt- single Phase, Model W372-A05XP
