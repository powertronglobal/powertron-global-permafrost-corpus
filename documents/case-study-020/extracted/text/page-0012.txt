Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the ﬁnal calculated average performance measurements before and after the ECM was installed 
on the pilot cooling system. 
Average Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Capacity:  2.35 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline:  2.01 kW/ton * 2.83 tons = 5.69 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh:  5.69 kW * 3,000 Annual Operating Hours = 17,070 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 17,070 kWh * $.102 = $1,741
Average Post Energy Consumption
kW Post:  1.5 kW/ton * 2.83 tons = 4.25 kW
Annual kWh Post:  4.25 kW * 3,000 hours = 12,750 kWh
Annual Cost Post:  12,750 kWh * $.102 cents = $1,301
Average Savings Per Year Per Unit
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year:  $1,741 - $1,301 = $440
Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $440 / 12 = $37
Return on Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot cooling system: $308
Estimated ROI for Regional Telecom when treating the pilot cooling system: $308 / $37 = ~8.3 mos
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 143%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 714%
Explanation of Regression Analysis
To obtain an avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Regional Telecom for implementing PermaFrost 
NMR®, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy savings resulting from the improvement 
in both capacity and efﬁciency utilizing data collected during the pilot study. Working together, these 
improvements reduce the annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining 
what the cost to run the cooling systems was when operating at the original energy proﬁle to produce the newly 
restored amount of available capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the cooling systems at the 
same restored capacity after the PermaFrost NMR® was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely 
accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or load % at which the systems will now 
operate due to the restored performance proﬁle. This restored performance proﬁle allows the cooling systems to 
satisfy the internal area set points with increased efﬁciency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading or 
runtime.
