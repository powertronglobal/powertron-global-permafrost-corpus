Improved Unit Cost
The “Unit Cost” in the HVAC industry is the kW/ton ratio. 
KW/ton is commonly used for larger commercial and 
industrial air conditioning, heat pump and refrigeration 
systems. It is the HVAC industry’s standard of 
determining how much energy is required to create a 
single ton of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you 
reduce the unit cost of cooling, the client is saving 
energy regardless of how much overall cooling they 
require.
The chart to the right clearly illustrates the amount of 
efﬁciency restoration the ECM created in the pilot 
cooling system just 4 weeks after treatment. The treated 
pilot cooling system is now performing 25.4% more 
efﬁciently than before being treated. This degradation in 
operational efﬁciency was costing Regional Telecom a 
substantial amount of money in wasted energy.
