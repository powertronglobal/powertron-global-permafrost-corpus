The ECM will beneﬁt Regional Telecom in any or all of the following ways:\n \n• Restore capacity of the cooling systems to better satisfy ﬂuctuating shelter loads\n \n \n• Produce additional cooling system redundancy at no extra cost or interruption to operations \n \n• Improve cooling system efﬁciency, lowering cost to produce each ton of cooling required \n \n• Restoring thermal efﬁciency, allowing cooling systems to achieve thermostat set points faster\n \n• Improve cooling system performance, reducing runtime and extending equipment life by 15%+ \n \n• Reduce amp draw and kW and overall kWh consumption\n \n• Reducing operating systems pressures in compressors, reducing unscheduled service calls \nThe improvements demonstrated in this or any ﬁeld test resulting from PermaFrost NMR® are dependent on \nfactors such as age, condition, service history, runtime of one or both compressors and the design and \napplication of each system. The results in this pilot were very consistent with 10+ year historical performance \naverages as well as the recent laboratory study completed in May, 2015 on DX equipment by Underwriters \nLaboratories (UL) in their testing chambers in [Texas Location], TX.\nSetting the Stage for the Study\nThe location chosen for this pilot (#1) is a standard cell tower shelter supported by two 3-ton wall-mounted \ncooling systems operating in a redundant fashion. The systems are rotated so runtime on each is balanced out \nover time. The primary cooling system is normally set to 72 degrees as it was for the pilot, while the back-up \ncooling system is set for 78 degrees so it only operates when the shelter load gets so heavy that the single \ncooling system can no longer keep up or it malfunctions. At the start of the pilot the average temperature in the \ndata center was 73 degrees.  In normal late summer weather, the pilot cooling system #1 was able to satisfy its 72 \ndegrees set point and cycle off on a regular basis. By restoring the majority of any lost capacity, once PermaFrost \nNMR® is allowed to work, the expectation is that the cooling systems should produce cooler, drier air and thus \nreach set point quicker so the system runs less.", "tokens": 794, "chars": 3671, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_028_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:f7316cc4878f51a55ea66ee9befab11f729f7835e836b79b6a13db27b5588281"}

Four weeks after installation, \n \n   the cooling capacity was restored by .48 tons or 20.4% to 2.83 tons. \n \n• The overall cost to produce each ton of cooling on the pilot system dropped 25.4% from 2.01 kW/ton \n \n   in the baseline to 1.5 kW/ton four weeks after installation of the ECM. This means that for every ton of \n \n   cooling the pilot system is asked to produce, Regional Telecom is spending 25.4% less money to do so.\n \n• The projected annual kWh’s were reduced by 25.3% from 17,070 to 12,750.\n \n• The conditions inside the cell tower shelter remained constant at 73 degrees while the cooling system \n \n   ran less but produced more tonnage. \n \n• The average kW dropped 10% from 4.72 in the baseline to 4.25 in the post when comparing multiple \n \n   hour-long blocks of time under similar outdoor air temperatures affecting the condensing units. The \n \n   true effect of these savings over time are further explained in the regression analysis.\nThe cell tower cooling system involved in the study is recorded as follows:\n \nBard, Mfg date: 2004, R22, Nominal 3-tons, 240 volt- single Phase, Model W372-A05XP\n3\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 722, "chars": 3029, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_028_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_028_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:d0f0f7da4fa10cc301466548ef0de85cfa61a3ce58107c5de84459418e4f704d"}

They included: \n \n1. Determine that the “as-is” capacity and efﬁciency of the pilot cooling system supporting the \n \n   Regional Telecom complex had degraded by at least 10% after 14 years in operation.  \n \n2. Demonstrate at least 10% performance improvement in tonnage and/or corresponding kW/ton and \n \n   energy reduction in the pilot cooling system four weeks after installing PermaFrost NMR®. \n \n3. Demonstrate the ability of the pilot cooling system to produce cooler, drier air as measured in both Dry \n \n   Bulb and Wet Bulb deltas after being treated.  \n \n4. To support an effective business case for further deployments of the ECM within the Regional Telecom \n \n   portfolio of properties, demonstrate ﬁnancial beneﬁts associated with efﬁciency improvements realized \n \n   over the duration of the study. These beneﬁts must be equivalent to a 24-month or less payback to \n \n   Regional Telecom on their initial project costs.  \nECM Product Brief\nPermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented surface science nanotechnology that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative \n(NMR®) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost \nNMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type of climate control system in which it is installed.  The direct beneﬁts \nof PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling efﬁciency and increased capacity. \nMethodology\nAfter verifying the amount of air ﬂowing across the evaporator coils before beginning each pilot, the subsequent \nmeasurements used in the efﬁciency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with Option B of \nthe IPMVP (International Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol). \nThe results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic \nengineering formulas:\n \n• kW= Volts * Amps * Power Factor * Sq Rt 3 /1000 (for 3-Phase) \n \n• kW/ton= Actual Measured Energy / Actual Measured Capacity \n \n• Coefﬁcient of Performance (COP)= 12 / (kW/ton) /3.412\n \n• Actual Cooling Capacity per Hour= (Measured CFM * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta T) / 12,000 BTU\n4\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 672, "chars": 2868, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_028_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_028_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:2774b1566156a4fffb97f1d9c99c4fc7818ffaa0d55e05c6e133170eb0d9cc98"}

It is the HVAC industry’s standard of \ndetermining how much energy is required to create a \nsingle ton of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you \nreduce the unit cost of cooling, the client is saving \nenergy regardless of how much overall cooling they \nrequire.\nThe chart to the right clearly illustrates the amount of \nefﬁciency restoration the ECM created in the pilot \ncooling system just 4 weeks after treatment. The treated \npilot cooling system is now performing 25.4% more \nefﬁciently than before being treated.

Working together, these \nimprovements reduce the annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining \nwhat the cost to run the cooling systems was when operating at the original energy proﬁle to produce the newly \nrestored amount of available capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the cooling systems at the \nsame restored capacity after the PermaFrost NMR® was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely \naccepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or load % at which the systems will now \noperate due to the restored performance proﬁle. This restored performance proﬁle allows the cooling systems to \nsatisfy the internal area set points with increased efﬁciency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading or \nruntime.  \n12\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\nCertiﬁcation\n[Engineering Consultant], P.E., for EET reviewed the testing and data collection methodology used in this pilot and \nattests to the integrity and accuracy of the data pre and post PermaFrost NMR® treatment.\nPlace P.E.
