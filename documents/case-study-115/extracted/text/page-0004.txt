7.7, under the modified air flow measurement protocol and utilizing the air flow calculation stated in 
section 7.7.4 for standard air. 
The test sample was evaluated under the AHRI 340/360-2007 “Performance Rating of Commercial and 
Industrial Unitary Air-Conditioning & Heat Pump Equipment” test standard for performance and 
efficiency covering equipment ranging from 65,000 to 300,000 BTU’S.    
All electrical data was recorded using utility grade power meters during the three 10 minute test 
sessions. This same data is supplied with test results for each category.   
As previously stated, the test sample unit was set up and tested to provide a baseline when subjected to 
“Standard rating Test Conditions” according to AHRI 340/360 2007.  The unit was operated at full load 
test conditions per the standard to provide a 100% “A” test sequence. There were three 10-minute 
collection time segments at each of the test points (30-minutes total) and then all data was averaged.  
The key performance test points for the 7.5-ton sample were as follows: 
  
-­‐ 
Voltage and Amperage 
-­‐ 
EER 
-­‐ 
Entering evaporator air volume 
-­‐ 
Dry and wet bulb temperatures 
-­‐ 
Refrigerant pressures and temperatures 
-­‐ 
Condensate capture 
 
 
Summary Results 
 
Below is the resulting data recorded during the testing periods on the test unit under the previously 
identified AHRI standards.  The conditions for the 100% “A” test included standard with ambient 
environmental conditions at 95 degrees F dry bulb and 75 degrees F wet bulb and entering evaporator 
coil air temperature at 80 degrees F dry bulb and 67 degrees F wet bulb at 400 CFM per ton @ design 
static pressure.
