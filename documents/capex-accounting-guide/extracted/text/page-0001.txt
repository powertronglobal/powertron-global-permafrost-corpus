Capital Expenditure 
  
Every customer decides how to account for expenditures under GAAP rules. 
Powertron Global can only attest to scientific fact and the effect of its 
nanotechnology products. However, such information may inform accounting 
decisions. 
 
PermaFrost NMR® restores HVAC systems to “at or near” original design cooling 
efficiency. Greater efficiency reduces machine runtime for the same workload - 
extending the useful life of treated equipment. The improvement is permanent.  
 
Treasury Regulations Guidelines help distinguish operational expense from 
capital expense where technologies extend asset useful life: 
 
• Capital expenses are “Improvements that prolong the life of the asset, restore 
asset to a “like-new” condition, or add value to the asset.” 
 
1. PermaFrost NMR® extends the useful life of a fixed asset up-to 20%. 
2. The technology bonds with metal surfaces and lasts for the remaining life 
of the treated HVAC system. Typically, well over 5 years. 
3. PermaFrost NMR® is a tangible product that becomes a permanent part of 
an HVAC system. It cannot be removed and will not wear out under normal 
operating conditions. 
4. PermaFrost NMR® improves the value of a fixed asset as measured in 
equipment life extension, reduction of maintenance and reduced cost to 
operate. 
5. PermaFrost NMR® is not a service, nor does it require additional service 
attention once installed.
