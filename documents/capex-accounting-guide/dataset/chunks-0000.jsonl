Greater efficiency reduces machine runtime for the same workload - \nextending the useful life of treated equipment. The improvement is permanent.  \n \nTreasury Regulations Guidelines help distinguish operational expense from \ncapital expense where technologies extend asset useful life: \n \n• Capital expenses are “Improvements that prolong the life of the asset, restore \nasset to a “like-new” condition, or add value to the asset.” \n \n1.
