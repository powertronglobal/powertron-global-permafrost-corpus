Many industry leading \norganizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in \ncapacity and efficiency as they age. Thermal degradation is caused by a \nphenomenon that is present in all HVACR equipment that operates as a \nvapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. \nThis thermal degradation is well documented by the HVACR industry and \nthe original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal degradation \nprevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to \nexcessive run-times and additional kWh consumption.\nThe chiller in this study is representative of a great majority of the portfolio \nof equipment operated by Data Center Provider. If thermal degradation is present in this \nCRAC unit, it is present in the entire inventory of equipment. Energy waste \ncan be calculated based on this unit (portfolio representation) and then \naccurately extrapolated across the entire inventory of equipment.\n1\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 512, "chars": 2446, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_104_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:6c44e183fba7e0a1594e66e1cfb2fba427b8711a27d6205581079954aea93676"}

The cooling capacity the CRAC unit is capable of producing after 16 years in service (refurbished 5 years ago). \n2.  The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the CRAC unit is delivering as \n     reflected in the kW/ton measurement. \n3.  The thermal dynamic ability of the CRAC unit to still perform at or close to operational design.\nMethodology\nThe measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the \nIPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted of Data Center Provider’s Data \nCenter Manager, [Client Representative]; Technician [Client Representative] and Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, \n[Senior Energy Engineer].  \nNotes \nThough mounted on top of the power room raised floor, the CRAC unit tested was elevated 18 inches above the raised \nfloor and discharged supply air along the floor, not below it. Both the baseline and post measurement s were taken with \noutside air temperatures of 71 degrees but the post was more humid which showed in the slightly higher entering wet \nbulb reading in the post.  \nData Center Provider’s management of the data center power room during the trial provided more than an adequate heat load on the pilot \nCRAC unit to ensure it would remain running during the actual data collection period. \nThe boundary of the testing was the CRAC unit and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance \ncalculations is very high.\n \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 526, "chars": 2604, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_104_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_104_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:4b4c76f8f2b4fca971bb4772695bbd43c9725aa00ca8312f2019a792f1eb91de"}

The report will also illustrate the amount of thermal \ndegradation that has occurred due in large part to thermal degradation within the heat exchangers and how much of \nthat has been restored.\n \nThe following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. \nThe results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:\n• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) \n• Tons = (Airflow * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta) / 12,000 \n• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage \n• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)\n• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Air Temp – Saturated Suction Temp \nNotes \nFollowing a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to determine the operational condition of the system was \nsatisfactory, Baseline M&V data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. Four hundred runtime hours after \ninstallation of PermaFrost NMR®, the M&V team returned on a very similar weather day to the Baseline to take Post \nM&V measurements in the identical fashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements and associated \ncalculations show the amount of capacity restored.\nThe following IPMVP data points were recorded on 5 May 2014 using recently calibrated devices by NIST (National \nInstitutes of Standards and Technology) to insure measurement accuracy. The CRAC unit was then treated with \nPermaFrost NMR® on the same day and allowed to run at greater than 90% load until 23 May 2014 to ensure the \npatented surface science nanotechnology had ample time to seat into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All \nmeasurements were taken at 100% load and at similar return air and outdoor air temperatures. \nThe collection of the data in both the baseline and post periods was collected by Powertron Global® under the watchful eye \nof the Data Center Provider technician who maintains the unit.

The lower operating tonnage and COP \nratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. The \ndegraded equipment performance is costing Data Center Provider significant money and wasting energy. The equipment is \nusing significantly more kWh to operate than it used when it was new. \nThe performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the CRAC unit in the baseline and \npost testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. \nThe implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 8.3 operating tons and an average \nimprovement of 32.5% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the \nCRAC unit throughout the year. The Leibert CRAC unit treated has a nominal capacity of 31 tons at 100% load \nat 85 degree entering air.

The unit was performing at an average of 73.2% of the original design \nefficiency when PermaFrost NMR® was first installed. The actual design rated tonnage of this CRAC unit is 31 \ntons. In actuality however, the unit was only producing 23.7 tons at the start of the pilot. The majority of this \n26.8% efficiency loss was directly attributable to the thermal degradation of the heat exchange surfaces. This is \ndue in large part to thermal degradation creating an insulating barrier to heat transfer through the tube walls. \nPost installation, the average efficiency in the CRAC unit jumped up to 103% of design specifications or 32 tons. \nThis represents a 35% improvement in efficiency over the baseline numbers.\nOriginal Design\nEﬃciency\nASHRAE Projected\nEﬃciency Loss\nOver Time\nActual Data Center Provider\nDesign Eﬃciency as\nMeasured In-Situ\nActual Data Center Provider HVAC/R Operating Eﬃciency\nvs. ASHRAE Projected Eﬃciency Loss\nHVAC/R Eﬃciency %\nDESIGN EFFICIENCY\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\nEﬃciency\nImprovement\n35%\n \n \n \nAge of HVAC/R Units\nAvg Age of Data Center Provider\nEquipment\n16\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 512, "chars": 1915, "pages": {"start": 6, "end": 7}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_104_chunk_0005", "next_id": "pdf_104_chunk_0007", "content_hash": "sha256:64ebceef1cae75ae4b9deb6b526c25ab4435517618661f691ac9a25f8bb6fd3c"}

The \naverage cost to operate this unit as calculated in kW/ ton was 1.66 in the Baseline. When new, the kW/ton \nrating for units like these usually range from 1.0 to 1.2 kW/ton. This means Data Center Provider was paying up to 27.7% more \nthan design for energy to run the CRAC unit as a direct result of the baseline reduced level of performance. The \nkW/ton ratings measured on site in [New Jersey Location], NJ were very much in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance \nand cost to operate numbers.\n  \nThe restored average kW/ton rating following the treatment is now 1.25. This represents a 24.7% reduction in \nenergy costs from the baseline for every ton of cooling produced. It also brings down the Data Center Provider costs to operate \nthe unit to just 3% off of design. This will result in an initial payback period to Data Center Provider of approximately 7 months. \nOver just a few years these accumulated savings will greatly reduce the eventual CapEx costs to replace the \nCRAC unit when it finally reaches the end of its useful life.   \nOriginal Design\nEﬃciency\nASHRAE Projected\nCost to Operate\nOver Time\nActual Cost to\nOperate Data Center Provider\nSystems As Is\nOperational Cost %\nActual Data Center Provider HVAC/R Operating Cost\nvs. ASHRAE Historical Performance\n-40\n-20\n00\n20\n40\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n \n \n \nAvg Age of Data Center Provider\nEquipment\n16\nEXPECTED COST\nAge of HVAC/R Units\n24.7%\nin Energy\nSavings\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 580, "chars": 2310, "pages": {"start": 7, "end": 8}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_104_chunk_0006", "next_id": "pdf_104_chunk_0008", "content_hash": "sha256:3c784d0c180b8e984f5cd506726dcd28a45248a6c8c0bee179a80733832a417f"}

This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in the \nPost Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems was when operating at the original \nenergy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost \nto run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® was installed.
