HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Calculated Eﬃciency of Data Center Provider CRAC Unit Baseline and Post
The chart below illustrates just how far off design the Data Center Provider CRAC unit had degraded in terms of efficiency over 
16 years of the coils being in use. The unit was performing at an average of 73.2% of the original design 
efficiency when PermaFrost NMR® was first installed. The actual design rated tonnage of this CRAC unit is 31 
tons. In actuality however, the unit was only producing 23.7 tons at the start of the pilot. The majority of this 
26.8% efficiency loss was directly attributable to the thermal degradation of the heat exchange surfaces. This is 
due in large part to thermal degradation creating an insulating barrier to heat transfer through the tube walls. 
Post installation, the average efficiency in the CRAC unit jumped up to 103% of design specifications or 32 tons. 
This represents a 35% improvement in efficiency over the baseline numbers.
