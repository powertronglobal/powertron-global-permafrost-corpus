Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
CRAC Unit Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Data Center Provider has the problem of thermal degradation in its HVAC/R units. The lower operating tonnage and COP 
ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. The 
degraded equipment performance is costing Data Center Provider significant money and wasting energy. The equipment is 
using significantly more kWh to operate than it used when it was new. 
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the CRAC unit in the baseline and 
post testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. 
The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 8.3 operating tons and an average 
improvement of 32.5% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the 
CRAC unit throughout the year. The Leibert CRAC unit treated has a nominal capacity of 31 tons at 100% load 
at 85 degree entering air. Since normal operations were not to be changed to accommodate the pilot, the 
emphasis here is on the delta between baseline and post.
