Recovered Wasted Energy with PermaFrost NMR®
The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration PermaFrost NMR® created in the treated 
CRAC unit. The average cost to operate this unit before 
it was treated, as calculated in kW/ton, was 1.66.
The specific cost to operate this unit after it was treated 
with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in kW/ton, is 
currently 1.25.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ 
was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate for 
a 16 year old CRAC unit. The post results are also in 
line with the average improvement savings shown over 
more than 120,000 installations globally.
