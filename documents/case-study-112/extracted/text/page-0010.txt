Notes
The pilot CRAC unit provides cooling to the 
main Power Room at the Data Center Provider complex. Given 
the consistently heavy load and the other two 
CRAC units available to support in the cooling 
duties, the pilot unit runs approximately 4,500 
hours or more annually prior to the installation.
