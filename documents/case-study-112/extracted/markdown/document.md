HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report

Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study

The purpose of this study is to verify the industry wide problem of efficiency

loss in HVAC/R as projected by ASHRAE research and to quantify the

amount of money wasted due to this loss. Many industry leading

organizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in

capacity and efficiency as they age. Thermal degradation is caused by a

phenomenon that is present in all HVACR equipment that operates as a

vapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant.

This thermal degradation is well documented by the HVACR industry and

the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal degradation

prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to

excessive run-times and additional kWh consumption.

The chiller in this study is representative of a great majority of the portfolio

of equipment operated by Data Center Provider. If thermal degradation is present in this

CRAC unit, it is present in the entire inventory of equipment. Energy waste

can be calculated based on this unit (portfolio representation) and then

accurately extrapolated across the entire inventory of equipment.

Process

This report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of one of dozens of CRAC

units that support the Data Center Provider Facility in [New Jersey Location], NJ.

Detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the pilot CRAC unit before and

after the installation of the ECM to determine the impact on the three key elements that greatly affect Data Center Provider’s

HVAC power bill as they relate to the original design specifications:

1.  The cooling capacity the CRAC unit is capable of producing after 16 years in service (refurbished 5 years ago).

2.  The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the CRAC unit is delivering as

reflected in the kW/ton measurement.

3.  The thermal dynamic ability of the CRAC unit to still perform at or close to operational design.

Methodology

The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the

IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted of Data Center Provider’s Data

Center Manager, [Client Representative]; Technician [Client Representative] and Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering,

[Senior Energy Engineer].

Notes

Though mounted on top of the power room raised floor, the CRAC unit tested was elevated 18 inches above the raised

floor and discharged supply air along the floor, not below it. Both the baseline and post measurement s were taken with

outside air temperatures of 71 degrees but the post was more humid which showed in the slightly higher entering wet

bulb reading in the post.

Data Center Provider’s management of the data center power room during the trial provided more than an adequate heat load on the pilot

CRAC unit to ensure it would remain running during the actual data collection period.

The boundary of the testing was the CRAC unit and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance

calculations is very high.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)

The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the pilot CRAC unit to perform prior to

and following PermaFrost NMR® (ECM) being installed. The report will also illustrate the amount of thermal

degradation that has occurred due in large part to thermal degradation within the heat exchangers and how much of

that has been restored.

The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan.

The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:

• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase)

• Tons = (Airflow * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta) / 12,000

• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage

• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)

• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Air Temp – Saturated Suction Temp

Notes

Following a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to determine the operational condition of the system was

satisfactory, Baseline M&V data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. Four hundred runtime hours after

installation of PermaFrost NMR®, the M&V team returned on a very similar weather day to the Baseline to take Post

M&V measurements in the identical fashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements and associated

calculations show the amount of capacity restored.

The following IPMVP data points were recorded on 5 May 2014 using recently calibrated devices by NIST (National

Institutes of Standards and Technology) to insure measurement accuracy. The CRAC unit was then treated with

PermaFrost NMR® on the same day and allowed to run at greater than 90% load until 23 May 2014 to ensure the

patented surface science nanotechnology had ample time to seat into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All

measurements were taken at 100% load and at similar return air and outdoor air temperatures.

The collection of the data in both the baseline and post periods was collected by Powertron Global® under the watchful eye

of the Data Center Provider technician who maintains the unit. The measurements are listed below.

Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results

CRAC Unit Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM

Data Center Provider has the problem of thermal degradation in its HVAC/R units. The lower operating tonnage and COP

ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. The

degraded equipment performance is costing Data Center Provider significant money and wasting energy. The equipment is

using significantly more kWh to operate than it used when it was new.

The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the CRAC unit in the baseline and

post testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation.

The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 8.3 operating tons and an average

improvement of 32.5% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the

CRAC unit throughout the year. The Leibert CRAC unit treated has a nominal capacity of 31 tons at 100% load

at 85 degree entering air. Since normal operations were not to be changed to accommodate the pilot, the

emphasis here is on the delta between baseline and post.

Recovered Wasted Energy with PermaFrost NMR®

The chart to the right illustrates the performance

restoration PermaFrost NMR® created in the treated

CRAC unit. The average cost to operate this unit before

it was treated, as calculated in kW/ton, was 1.66.

The specific cost to operate this unit after it was treated

with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in kW/ton, is

currently 1.25.

The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ

was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of

performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate for

a 16 year old CRAC unit. The post results are also in

line with the average improvement savings shown over

more than 120,000 installations globally.

HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results

Calculated Eﬃciency of Data Center Provider CRAC Unit Baseline and Post

The chart below illustrates just how far off design the Data Center Provider CRAC unit had degraded in terms of efficiency over

16 years of the coils being in use. The unit was performing at an average of 73.2% of the original design

efficiency when PermaFrost NMR® was first installed. The actual design rated tonnage of this CRAC unit is 31

tons. In actuality however, the unit was only producing 23.7 tons at the start of the pilot. The majority of this

26.8% efficiency loss was directly attributable to the thermal degradation of the heat exchange surfaces. This is

due in large part to thermal degradation creating an insulating barrier to heat transfer through the tube walls.

Post installation, the average efficiency in the CRAC unit jumped up to 103% of design specifications or 32 tons.

This represents a 35% improvement in efficiency over the baseline numbers.

HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results

Cost to Data Center Provider to Operate the CRAC Unit Baseline vs Post

The next chart illustrates the just how much money the efficiency performance loss in the pilot CRAC unit was

costing Data Center Provider in the way of wasted energy each and every day they were operating prior to the installation. The

average cost to operate this unit as calculated in kW/ ton was 1.66 in the Baseline. When new, the kW/ton

rating for units like these usually range from 1.0 to 1.2 kW/ton. This means Data Center Provider was paying up to 27.7% more

than design for energy to run the CRAC unit as a direct result of the baseline reduced level of performance. The

kW/ton ratings measured on site in [New Jersey Location], NJ were very much in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance

and cost to operate numbers.

The restored average kW/ton rating following the treatment is now 1.25. This represents a 24.7% reduction in

energy costs from the baseline for every ton of cooling produced. It also brings down the Data Center Provider costs to operate

the unit to just 3% off of design. This will result in an initial payback period to Data Center Provider of approximately 7 months.

Over just a few years these accumulated savings will greatly reduce the eventual CapEx costs to replace the

CRAC unit when it finally reaches the end of its useful life.

Return On Investment

The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR®

Post measurement period for the Data Center Provider CRAC Unit.

Baseline Energy Consumption

Baseline Tonnage: 23.7 tons

Adjusted kW Baseline: 1.66 kW/ton * 32 tons = 53.12 kW

Adjusted Baseline kWh: 53.12 kW * 4,500 Annual Operating Hrs = 239,040 kWh

Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 239,040 kWh * $.12 = $28,685

Post Energy Consumption

kW Post: 1.25 kW/ton * 32 tons = 40 kW

Annual kWh Post: 40 kW * 4,500 hours = 180,000 kWh

Annual Cost Post: 180,000 kWh * .12 cents = $21,600

Savings Per Year

Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $28,685 - $21,600 = $7,085

Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $7,085 / 12 = $590

Return On Investment

Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot CRAC unit: $3,875

Estimated ROI Period for Pilot CRAC Unit: $3,875 / $590 = 6.6 months

Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period

for Data Center Provider for implementing the PermaFrost NMR®, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy

savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in the

Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems was when operating at the original

energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost

to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® was installed. This regression analysis is

the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the systems will now operate due to the

restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the internal building set points with increased

efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.

Data Center Provider is Saving More than Just Energy

By treating just the pilot CRAC unit with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the current manner Data Center Provider operates this

unit, it will save approximately 59,040 kWh per year and all the costs associated with those savings. From an

environmental impact standpoint, Data Center Provider is also benefitting the surrounding community of [New Jersey Location], NJ.

Imagine how great the environmental impact will be when Data Center Provider moves forward with treating all their

climate control systems in [New Jersey Location] and across the USA.

The 59,040 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 40.7 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from

being released or any of the following:

Annual greenhouse emissions from:

CO2 emissions from:
