Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Chiller Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Major US Telecom is experiencing significant thermal degradation in their data center HVAC systems. The lower 
baseline operating tonnage and COP ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance 
and cost to operate numbers. The degraded equipment performance was costing Major US Telecom significant money and 
wasting energy. The pilot chiller was using significantly more kWh to operate than it used when it was new. 
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the chiller in the baseline and post 
testing periods, demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. 
The implementation of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 39 operating tons equating to 
20.1%; an improvement of 21% in Coefficient of Performance (COP) and a reduction in kW/ton of 16.9%, 
significantly reducing the cost to operate the chiller throughout the year.
The Major US Telecom HVAC Equipment Manufacturer chiller treated has a nominal capacity of 500 tons and 1,020 gallons per minute (GPM) flow 
through the evaporator. The chiller used in this pilot was tested at 49% load with a GPM flow right near design 
at 1,034 after adjusting on site prior to starting the baseline readings.
