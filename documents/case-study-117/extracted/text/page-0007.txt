Chiller Eﬃciency Study Results
Calculated Eﬃciency of Major US Telecom Chiller Baseline and Post
The chart below illustrates just how far off design the Major US Telecom pilot chiller had degraded in terms of efficiency 
over an average of 14 years of the heat exchange coils being in use. 
The chiller was performing at an average of 79.2% of the original design efficiency. The nominal design rated 
tonnage of the chiller is 500 tons at 100% load and 245 tons at 49% load. In actuality however, the chiller was 
only producing 194 tons at the start of the pilot. The majority of the 20.8% efficiency loss in the chiller is directly 
attributable to the thermal degradation of the heat exchange surfaces. This is due in large part to thermal degradation 
creating an insulating barrier to heat transfer through the tube walls. 
After PermaFrost NMR® was installed, the average efficiency in the chiller jumped up to 95.1% of design 
specifications or 233 tons.  This represents a 20% improvement in efficiency over the baseline numbers.
