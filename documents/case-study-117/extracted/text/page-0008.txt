Chiller Eﬃciency Study Results
Cost to Major US Telecom to Operate the Chiller Baseline vs Post
The next chart illustrates the just how much money the efficiency performance loss in the pilot chiller was 
costing Major US Telecom in the way of wasted energy each and every day it was operating prior to the PermaFrost 
NMR®. The average cost to operate the chiller as calculated in kW/ ton was .65 in the Baseline. When new, the 
kW/ton rating for chillers like these usually range from .50 - .52 kW/ton at 49% load. This means Major US Telecom was 
paying up to 20% more than design for the energy to run the chiller as a direct result of the baseline reduced 
level of performance. These kW/ton ratings are very much in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and 
cost to operate numbers.
  
The restored average kW/ton rating for the chiller following the PermaFrost NMR® is now .54. This represents 
a 16.9% reduction in energy costs for the chiller from the baseline for every ton of cooling produced. It also 
brings down the Major US Telecom costs to operate the chiller to nearly what they were when the chiller was new.  
The $15,716 in annual energy savings generated during the pilot have resulted in an initial payback period to 
Major US Telecom of approximately 9.2 months. Over just 10 more years in operation the accumulated net savings will 
reach $145,160, greatly reducing the eventual CapEx costs to replace the chiller when it finally reaches the end 
of its useful life.
