Notes: The pilot chiller provides cooling to the main 
Major US Telecom data center floors. It operates in tandem with 
one of the other three chillers in the plant to share the 
cooling load. In case of a chiller failure one of the chillers 
can assume the entire load while another chiller is 
brought online. Given the facility load, the pilot chiller 
runs approximately 4,380 hours or more annually prior 
to the ECM being implemented.
