Recovered Wasted Energy with PermaFrost NMR®
Chiller
The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration the ECM created in the treated chiller. The 
average cost to operate this chiller before it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, was .65.
The specific cost to operate this chiller after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, is currently .54.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate for a 14 year old chiller. The post results are also in line 
with the average improvement savings shown in more than 120,000 installations globally.
