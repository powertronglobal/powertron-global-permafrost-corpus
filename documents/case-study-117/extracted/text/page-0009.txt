Major US Telecom Return on Initial PermaFrost NMR® Investment
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the Major US Telecom pilot chiller.
Baseline Energy Consumption without PermaFrost NMR®
Baseline Tonnage: 193 tons
kW Baseline (Adjusted): .65 kW/ton * 233 tons = 151.45 kW
Annual kWh Baseline: 151.45 kW * 4,380 Annual Operating Hrs = 663,351 kWh
Annual Cost Baseline: 663,351 kWh * $.14 = $92,869
Post Energy Consumption with PermaFrost NMR®
kW Post: .54 kW/ton * 233 tons = 125.82 kW
Annual kWh Post: 125.82 kW * 4,380 hours = 551,092 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 551,092 kWh * .14 cents = $77,153
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $92,869 - $77,153 = $15,716
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $15,716 / 12 = $1,310
Return On Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot chiller: $12,000
Estimated ROI Period for Chiller: $12,000 / $1,310 = 9.2 months
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period 
for Major US Telecom for implementing the PermaFrost NMR®, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true 
energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended 
in the Post Analysis Period by reducing the load. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller was 
when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and 
then subtracting the revised cost to run the chiller at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® was 
installed. 
This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced load the chiller will now 
operate at due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the chiller to maintain 48 degree leaving chilled 
water with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
