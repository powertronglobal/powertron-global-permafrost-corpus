HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report
Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study
The purpose of this study is to verify the industry wide problem of efficiency loss in HVAC/R systems as 
projected by ASHRAE research and to quantify the amount of money wasted due to this loss. Many industry 
leading organizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R systems degrade in capacity and efficiency 
as they age. Thermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVAC/R equipment that 
operates as a vapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal 
degradation is well documented by the HVAC/R industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). 
Thermal degradation prevents systems from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive 
run-times and additional kWh consumption.
The chiller in this study is representative of a great majority of the portfolio of data center and central office 
equipment operated by Major US Telecom. If thermal degradation is present in this chiller, it is present in the entire 
inventory of equipment. Energy waste can be calculated based on this equipment (portfolio representation) and 
then accurately extrapolated across the entire inventory of equipment.
Similarly, if the lost efficiency of this chiller can 
be restored, it would allow Major US Telecom to keep it in 
service longer without sacrificing performance 
or energy consumption. It will also provide 
Major US Telecom the flexibility of a much wider window 
of time wherein to undertake the costly capital 
expense of replacing this and other HVAC/R 
systems when they do eventually reach the end 
of their useful life.

Process
This report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of one of four main chillers 
that support the Major US Telecom Elmsford Data Center. 
Detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the pilot chiller before and after the 
installation of the ECM to determine the impact on the three key elements that greatly affect Major US Telecom’s HVAC 
power bill as they relate to the original design specifications:
 
 
1.  The cooling capacity the chiller is capable of producing after 14 years in service. 
 
2.  The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the chiller is delivering as 
 
     reflected in the kW/ton measurement. 
 
3.  The thermal dynamic ability of the chiller to still perform at or close to operational design.
Methodology
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the IPMVP 
(International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework using both instantaneous power reading and 
long term power readings with the chiller performing under similar operational and load conditions. 
The M&V team was led by [Client Representative] of [Client Representative] Associates, with support from [Senior Energy Engineer], 
Director of Engineering for Powertron Global®. Major US Telecom personnel overseeing the pilot and supporting the 
M&V team on site included [Special Projects Manager], [Sr. Facility Engineer] and [Facilities Engineer]. The overall project was managed and 
directed by [Facility Manager], Sr. Program Manager for Major US Telecom Corporate Special Projects.  
 
Notes 
Both the baseline and post readings were taken at 49% load with incoming condenser water within a degree of 78 degrees 
and incoming chilled water at 53 degrees, therefore no adjustments were made to the resulting data. Major US Telecom’s 
management of the chiller plant combined with the building load during the trial provided more than an adequate heat load 
on the facility to ensure the chiller would remain running during the actual data collection period.  
The chiller was tested over the span of three weeks while operating at an average of 49% motor load. This is the minimum 
amount of time the PermaFrost NMR® ECM requires in a chiller of this size to produce maximum results, therefore 
Major US Telecom can expect to continue to see continued improvements over the next month. The boundary of the testing was the 
chiller and nothing else therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance calculations is very high.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the pilot chiller to perform prior to the 
PermaFrost NMR® (ECM) being installed, as well as illustrate the amount of thermal degradation due in large 
part to thermal degradation within the heat exchangers (evaporator and condenser barrels).  
The following report lists the results of using the IPMVP as the M&V plan. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following applicable thermodynamic engineering 
formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
 
• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU 
 
• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Water Temp – Suction Temp of Evaporator (CH) 
Notes 
Following a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to determine the operational condition of the systems, it was 
determined that the chiller had a much higher volume of water flowing through it than design so the team adjusted it 
downward to OEM specifications. With all other chiller conditions deemed satisfactory, Baseline M&V data was collected 
and recorded by the M&V team. 
Three weeks after installation of the PermaFrost NMR®, the M&V 
team returned to take Post M&V measurements in the identical 
fashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements and 
associated calculations show the amount of capacity restored.
The data in both the baseline and post periods was collected by 
[Client Representative] Associates via the Pharma Company B system and installed 
HOBO power meter. Powertron Global also collected information 
directly from the chiller panel while the chiller was running under 
identical operational conditions. All readings were witnessed by 
Major US Telecom technicians. Photographic evidence of the measurements 
is included in this report. The measurements are listed below. 
M&V team works to adjust flow 
rates through the chiller’s 
evaporator and condenser barrels, 
restoring them to within 2% of 
HVAC Equipment Manufacturer design specifications before 
recording all the baseline readings.

Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Chiller Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Major US Telecom is experiencing significant thermal degradation in their data center HVAC systems. The lower 
baseline operating tonnage and COP ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance 
and cost to operate numbers. The degraded equipment performance was costing Major US Telecom significant money and 
wasting energy. The pilot chiller was using significantly more kWh to operate than it used when it was new. 
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the chiller in the baseline and post 
testing periods, demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. 
The implementation of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 39 operating tons equating to 
20.1%; an improvement of 21% in Coefficient of Performance (COP) and a reduction in kW/ton of 16.9%, 
significantly reducing the cost to operate the chiller throughout the year.
The Major US Telecom HVAC Equipment Manufacturer chiller treated has a nominal capacity of 500 tons and 1,020 gallons per minute (GPM) flow 
through the evaporator. The chiller used in this pilot was tested at 49% load with a GPM flow right near design 
at 1,034 after adjusting on site prior to starting the baseline readings.

The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration the ECM created in the treated chiller. The 
average cost to operate this chiller before it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, was .65.
The specific cost to operate this chiller after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, is currently .54.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate for a 14 year old chiller. The post results are also in line 
with the average improvement savings shown in more than 120,000 installations globally.

Chiller Eﬃciency Study Results
Calculated Eﬃciency of Major US Telecom Chiller Baseline and Post
The chart below illustrates just how far off design the Major US Telecom pilot chiller had degraded in terms of efficiency 
over an average of 14 years of the heat exchange coils being in use. 
The chiller was performing at an average of 79.2% of the original design efficiency. The nominal design rated 
tonnage of the chiller is 500 tons at 100% load and 245 tons at 49% load. In actuality however, the chiller was 
only producing 194 tons at the start of the pilot. The majority of the 20.8% efficiency loss in the chiller is directly 
attributable to the thermal degradation of the heat exchange surfaces. This is due in large part to thermal degradation 
creating an insulating barrier to heat transfer through the tube walls. 
After PermaFrost NMR® was installed, the average efficiency in the chiller jumped up to 95.1% of design 
specifications or 233 tons.  This represents a 20% improvement in efficiency over the baseline numbers.

Cost to Major US Telecom to Operate the Chiller Baseline vs Post
The next chart illustrates the just how much money the efficiency performance loss in the pilot chiller was 
costing Major US Telecom in the way of wasted energy each and every day it was operating prior to the PermaFrost 
NMR®. The average cost to operate the chiller as calculated in kW/ ton was .65 in the Baseline. When new, the 
kW/ton rating for chillers like these usually range from .50 - .52 kW/ton at 49% load. This means Major US Telecom was 
paying up to 20% more than design for the energy to run the chiller as a direct result of the baseline reduced 
level of performance. These kW/ton ratings are very much in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and 
cost to operate numbers.
  
The restored average kW/ton rating for the chiller following the PermaFrost NMR® is now .54. This represents 
a 16.9% reduction in energy costs for the chiller from the baseline for every ton of cooling produced. It also 
brings down the Major US Telecom costs to operate the chiller to nearly what they were when the chiller was new.  
The $15,716 in annual energy savings generated during the pilot have resulted in an initial payback period to 
Major US Telecom of approximately 9.2 months. Over just 10 more years in operation the accumulated net savings will 
reach $145,160, greatly reducing the eventual CapEx costs to replace the chiller when it finally reaches the end 
of its useful life.

Major US Telecom Return on Initial PermaFrost NMR® Investment
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the Major US Telecom pilot chiller.
Baseline Energy Consumption without PermaFrost NMR®
Baseline Tonnage: 193 tons
kW Baseline (Adjusted): .65 kW/ton * 233 tons = 151.45 kW
Annual kWh Baseline: 151.45 kW * 4,380 Annual Operating Hrs = 663,351 kWh
Annual Cost Baseline: 663,351 kWh * $.14 = $92,869
Post Energy Consumption with PermaFrost NMR®
kW Post: .54 kW/ton * 233 tons = 125.82 kW
Annual kWh Post: 125.82 kW * 4,380 hours = 551,092 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 551,092 kWh * .14 cents = $77,153
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $92,869 - $77,153 = $15,716
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $15,716 / 12 = $1,310
Return On Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot chiller: $12,000
Estimated ROI Period for Chiller: $12,000 / $1,310 = 9.2 months
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period 
for Major US Telecom for implementing the PermaFrost NMR®, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true 
energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended 
in the Post Analysis Period by reducing the load. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller was 
when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and 
then subtracting the revised cost to run the chiller at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® was 
installed. 
This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced load the chiller will now 
operate at due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the chiller to maintain 48 degree leaving chilled 
water with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.

Notes: The pilot chiller provides cooling to the main 
Major US Telecom data center floors. It operates in tandem with 
one of the other three chillers in the plant to share the 
cooling load. In case of a chiller failure one of the chillers 
can assume the entire load while another chiller is 
brought online. Given the facility load, the pilot chiller 
runs approximately 4,380 hours or more annually prior 
to the ECM being implemented.

Estimated Savings to Major US Telecom for Treating Chiller #2 
The chart below illustrates the substantial savings potential Major US Telecom will realize following the treatment of 
Chiller #2 with PermaFrost NMR®. 
Kilowatt Hours (kWh) Loss / Gain With / Without PermaFrost NMR® Treatment
Savings indicated inside red circle equates to a 9.2 Month Initial Project Payback for Major US Telecom after treating 
chiller #2. This is determined by dividing the $12,000 cost of treating the 500-ton chiller with PermaFrost 
NMR® by the anticipated annual savings of $15,716 and then multiplying the result by 12 months. 
Savings indicated inside orange circle equates to an overall ROI for Major US Telecom of 1,440% over the remaining 
10 years of projected useful system life of chiller #2. This is determined by dividing the projected 10 years of 
avoided cost savings of $172,872 by the $12,000 cost of treating the chiller with PermaFrost NMR® and then

Estimated Savings to Major US Telecom for Treating Four Chillers
at Elmsford
The chart below illustrates the substantial savings potential Major US Telecom will realize when treating all four of the 
chillers at Elmsford data center with PermaFrost NMR®. 
Kilowatt Hours (kWh) Loss / Gain With / Without PermaFrost NMR® Treatment
Savings indicated inside red circle equates to a 9.2 Month Project Payback for Major US Telecom when treating all four 
of the chillers at Elmsford. This is determined by dividing the $48,000 cost of treating the four 500-ton chillers 
with PermaFrost NMR by the anticipated annual savings of $62,863 and then multiplying the result by 12 
months. 
Savings indicated inside orange circle equates to an overall ROI for Major US Telecom of 1,140% over the remaining 
10 years of projected useful system life across all of Elmsford. This is determined by dividing the projected 10 
years of avoided cost savings of $691,488 from all four chillers by the $48,000 cost of treating the chillers with 
PermaFrost NMR and then multiplying the result by 100.

Major US Telecom is Saving More than Just Energy across
Elmsford Data Center
By treating their Elmsford data center and its 2,000-tons of cooling with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the 
current manner Major US Telecom operates the chillers, it will save approximately 449,036 kWh per year and all the 
costs associated with those savings. 
From an environmental impact standpoint, Major US Telecom will also benefit the surrounding communities of New 
York.  Imagine how great the environmental impact will be when Major US Telecom moves forward with treating all 
their chillers in all their data centers.
The 449,036 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 310 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from 
being released or any of the following:
Annual greenhouse emissions from:
