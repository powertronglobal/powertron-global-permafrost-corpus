Many industry \nleading organizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R systems degrade in capacity and efficiency \nas they age. Thermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVAC/R equipment that \noperates as a vapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal \ndegradation is well documented by the HVAC/R industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). \nThermal degradation prevents systems from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive \nrun-times and additional kWh consumption.\nThe chiller in this study is representative of a great majority of the portfolio of data center and central office \nequipment operated by Major US Telecom. If thermal degradation is present in this chiller, it is present in the entire \ninventory of equipment. Energy waste can be calculated based on this equipment (portfolio representation) and \nthen accurately extrapolated across the entire inventory of equipment.\nSimilarly, if the lost efficiency of this chiller can \nbe restored, it would allow Major US Telecom to keep it in \nservice longer without sacrificing performance \nor energy consumption. It will also provide \nMajor US Telecom the flexibility of a much wider window \nof time wherein to undertake the costly capital \nexpense of replacing this and other HVAC/R \nsystems when they do eventually reach the end \nof their useful life.   \n1\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 654, "chars": 3126, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_113_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:6e6245688b311ce06aa27f17b733b85aa1826050c2ad82283ed3914761989165"}

The cooling capacity the chiller is capable of producing after 14 years in service. \n \n2.  The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the chiller is delivering as \n \n     reflected in the kW/ton measurement. \n \n3.  The thermal dynamic ability of the chiller to still perform at or close to operational design.\nMethodology\nThe measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the IPMVP \n(International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework using both instantaneous power reading and \nlong term power readings with the chiller performing under similar operational and load conditions. \nThe M&V team was led by [Client Representative] of [Client Representative] Associates, with support from [Senior Energy Engineer], \nDirector of Engineering for Powertron Global®. Major US Telecom personnel overseeing the pilot and supporting the \nM&V team on site included [Special Projects Manager], [Sr. Facility Engineer] and [Facilities Engineer]. The overall project was managed and \ndirected by [Facility Manager], Sr. Program Manager for Major US Telecom Corporate Special Projects.  \n \nNotes \nBoth the baseline and post readings were taken at 49% load with incoming condenser water within a degree of 78 degrees \nand incoming chilled water at 53 degrees, therefore no adjustments were made to the resulting data. Major US Telecom’s \nmanagement of the chiller plant combined with the building load during the trial provided more than an adequate heat load \non the facility to ensure the chiller would remain running during the actual data collection period.  \nThe chiller was tested over the span of three weeks while operating at an average of 49% motor load. This is the minimum \namount of time the PermaFrost NMR® ECM requires in a chiller of this size to produce maximum results, therefore \nMajor US Telecom can expect to continue to see continued improvements over the next month. The boundary of the testing was the \nchiller and nothing else therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance calculations is very high.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 639, "chars": 3204, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_113_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_113_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:9b39a5510f19d63dd50146bcd48623a89b4b05c13741894ce42f6e0122b800f3"}

With all other chiller conditions deemed satisfactory, Baseline M&V data was collected \nand recorded by the M&V team. \nThree weeks after installation of the PermaFrost NMR®, the M&V \nteam returned to take Post M&V measurements in the identical \nfashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements and \nassociated calculations show the amount of capacity restored.\nThe data in both the baseline and post periods was collected by \n[Client Representative] Associates via the Pharma Company B system and installed \nHOBO power meter.

The lower \nbaseline operating tonnage and COP ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance \nand cost to operate numbers. The degraded equipment performance was costing Major US Telecom significant money and \nwasting energy. The pilot chiller was using significantly more kWh to operate than it used when it was new. \nThe performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the chiller in the baseline and post \ntesting periods, demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. \nThe implementation of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 39 operating tons equating to \n20.1%; an improvement of 21% in Coefficient of Performance (COP) and a reduction in kW/ton of 16.9%, \nsignificantly reducing the cost to operate the chiller throughout the year.\nThe Major US Telecom HVAC Equipment Manufacturer chiller treated has a nominal capacity of 500 tons and 1,020 gallons per minute (GPM) flow \nthrough the evaporator. The chiller used in this pilot was tested at 49% load with a GPM flow right near design \nat 1,034 after adjusting on site prior to starting the baseline readings. \n6.57\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 663, "chars": 2685, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_113_chunk_0003", "next_id": "pdf_113_chunk_0005", "content_hash": "sha256:7293b42e3c3cc13a2602c100b6c7ee9c82c736336d5835d908c9f1b386b0fd4e"}

The nominal design rated \ntonnage of the chiller is 500 tons at 100% load and 245 tons at 49% load. In actuality however, the chiller was \nonly producing 194 tons at the start of the pilot. The majority of the 20.8% efficiency loss in the chiller is directly \nattributable to the thermal degradation of the heat exchange surfaces. This is due in large part to thermal degradation \ncreating an insulating barrier to heat transfer through the tube walls. \nAfter PermaFrost NMR® was installed, the average efficiency in the chiller jumped up to 95.1% of design \nspecifications or 233 tons.

The average cost to operate the chiller as calculated in kW/ ton was .65 in the Baseline. When new, the \nkW/ton rating for chillers like these usually range from .50 - .52 kW/ton at 49% load. This means Major US Telecom was \npaying up to 20% more than design for the energy to run the chiller as a direct result of the baseline reduced \nlevel of performance. These kW/ton ratings are very much in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and \ncost to operate numbers.\n  \nThe restored average kW/ton rating for the chiller following the PermaFrost NMR® is now .54. This represents \na 16.9% reduction in energy costs for the chiller from the baseline for every ton of cooling produced. It also \nbrings down the Major US Telecom costs to operate the chiller to nearly what they were when the chiller was new.  \nThe $15,716 in annual energy savings generated during the pilot have resulted in an initial payback period to \nMajor US Telecom of approximately 9.2 months. Over just 10 more years in operation the accumulated net savings will \nreach $145,160, greatly reducing the eventual CapEx costs to replace the chiller when it finally reaches the end \nof its useful life.   \n16.9%\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 718, "chars": 2697, "pages": {"start": 7, "end": 8}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_113_chunk_0005", "next_id": "pdf_113_chunk_0007", "content_hash": "sha256:e20c2f0442f650f89a50063355ac8291ed92f2ec261ebc101feace5a38624012"}

This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended \nin the Post Analysis Period by reducing the load. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller was \nwhen operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and \nthen subtracting the revised cost to run the chiller at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® was \ninstalled. \nThis regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced load the chiller will now \noperate at due to the restored capacity.
