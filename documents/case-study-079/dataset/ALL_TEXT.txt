Energy Performance Report
Company B - North
December 4, 2012
Product Brief
         Our patented surface chemical nanotechnology is a sustainable one-time treatment that lasts for the 
remaining useful life of any type of system in which it’s installed – DX (RTUs, Split Systems, CRAC’s), 
Chillers (including Ammonia Chillers), Heat Pumps, Ice Machines, or Refrigerated Transport. 
PermaFrost NMR® is a Nanotechnology that uses the patented Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) 
technology as its core agent.  When installed into the low side port, the product immediately goes to 
work restoring optimal heat transfer characteristics to the coils by embedding into the microscopic lattice structure of the metal as a thermal transfer agent, forming a passive nano-magnetic film on the surface. This process enhances the conductivity of the metal and creates a permanent thermal coating that maintains optimal heat transfer efficiency for the life of the equipment. 
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity, and 
better refrigerant flow – all of which allows a system to achieve set temperatures quicker and then shut 
off, unload or throttle back. 
The indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment 
include reduced run time, less kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, superior lubrication, 
less metallic wear and longer overall equipment life.

Executive Summary
        This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure 
(ECM) PermaFrost NMR® in Miami, Florida for M.D.C.  Detailed forensic performance testing (outlined 
later in this report) was performed on one 7.5 ton HVAC Equipment Manufacturer DX unit equipped with R-22 refrigerant. 
Immediately following the baseline testing, the unit was treated 
with the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® product 
formulated for R-22 DX systems.  Since there were no other 
ECM’s going on during this pilot project, the improvement in 
efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at the unit is 
solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The unit now 
provides cooler/drier supply air while using less power.  This 
greater operational efficiency is due to the restoration of the heat 
transfer ability of the evaporator and condenser coils.
Following treatment of PermaFrost NMR® the unit showed a 
substantial increase in coil capacity of 17,460 Btuh or 26.9% 
improvement overall system efficiency.  This restored capacity 
equates to 1.5 tons.  The unit also showed a substantial reduction 
in Watts/Ton of 24.4% and a 26.9% improvement in the Enthalpy 
Delta.  Additionally, the unit showed a 32.3% improvement in 
EER.  The Delta T improved by 25.9% which is another 
measurable way to view the thermodynamic enhancement of the 
PermaFrost NMR® ECM. 
The result of the ECM improvements is an ROI to Company B of just 6.5 months.  The tables of data and financial 
calculations are available for review at the end of this report.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) is used to develop this 
report.  The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and 
Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the 
IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and 
products.
There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize.  They 
are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.
Retrofit Isolation (Option B) is defined as: All parameter measurement with the boundary of the ECM 
(PermaFrost NMR®) as the single source of measurement.  Savings are determined by field measurement of 
the energy use of the energy conservation method affected equipment or system and any performance 
enhancements versus the baseline data.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term 
measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained.  The savings are calculated by 
short-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using 
measurements of proxies of energy use.
The final computation follows the formula:
The final computation follows the formula:

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content of the following report will demonstrate the effects of PermaFrost NMR®’s ability to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces. 
It was determined with Company B to treat one 7.5ton DX unit.  A diagnostic examination of the 
pilot equipment is implemented to determine if the unit’s operational conditions are satisfactory.  Baseline 
measurements will be recorded and then the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® will be injected.  
The product will be allowed 4 weeks to seat itself into the metal surfaces before post measurements were 
taken to establish the efficiency gains. 
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP International Performance Measurement and 
Verification Protocol as the M&V plan.  The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global’s Senior 
Energy Engineer [Senior Energy Engineer] ME/CEM/CMC/CMVP.
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
kW = Volts X Amps * .9 Single Phase or 1.47 Three Phase / 1000
 
Delta T = Return Air DB – Supply Air DB
 
Refrigerant Approach = Supply Air DB – Saturated Evaporator Temp
 
Enthalpy =  Return Air WB Deg. F and Supply Air WB Deg. F Converted to Enthalpy
 
Actual Btuh Capacity = Measured CFM X 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta 
 
System Eﬃciency % = Actual Coil Capacity Btuh / Nominal Coil Capacity Btuh

Energy Reporting Period
The identical IPMVP data recordings from the baseline were recorded on date using the same recently NIST 
calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy.  The measurements are as follows:  
The DB temperature (68 deg. F) entering the coil was matched exactly to the baseline period.  After 
matching this temperature the post readings were taken to ensure that the work the coil had to do was as 
similar as possible in the baseline.

The following are the final calculated performance measurements after performing the Regression Analysis to account 
to the restored capacity brought about by PermaFrost NMR®.
Baseline kWh = (8,836.3 CTW/1,000) * 6750 Annual Operating Hours = 59,645 kWh
Baseline Cost To Run = 59,645kWh * $.10 = $5,964 USD
Regression Analysis 
Adjusted Base Tonnage = 6.9 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted Total Watts = 1,636 WPT * 6.86 tons = 11,223 Watts
Adjusted Base kWh = (11,223 TW/1,000) * 6750 Annual Operating hrs = 75,755 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM = 75,755 kWh * $.10 = $7,575 
Post ECM kWh = (8,476 NTW / 1,000) * 6750 Annual Operating hrs = 57,213 kWh
Cost to Run After ECM = 57,213 kWh * $.10 = $5,721
Cost Savings per Month = ($7,575 - $5,721) / 12 months = $154
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® @ $1000 / $154 = 6.5 months
 
ROI = 6.5 months

Post 2 - 2/5/2013
A return trip was made out to the unit to further demonstrate PermaFrost NMR®'s ability to maintain or 
even further improve a treated system.  This system has shown further improvement due to its age and 
annual runtime demands.
       System Eﬃciency or BTUH:
4000 CFM x 4.5 (constant) X 5.93 (enthalpy Delta Post 2)= 106,740 BTU
106,740 BTUH / 92,000 (Nominal Capacity BTUH) = 116% 
The reason for the 116% total system efficiency improvement is due to the fact that the condensing unit is a 
7.7 (92,000 BTUH) ton and the air handler is a 10 (120,000 BTUH) ton unit.  This unit has improved in 
overall system efficiency from Post 1 to Post 2 by additional 24,480 BTUH or additional 29.8%.  This is due 
to allowing more "seating" time for PermaFrost NMR® to further penetrate all heat exchange surfaces.
