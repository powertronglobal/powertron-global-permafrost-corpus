When installed into the low side port, the product immediately goes to \nwork restoring optimal heat transfer characteristics to the coils by embedding into the microscopic lattice structure of the metal as a thermal transfer agent, forming a passive nano-magnetic film on the surface. This process enhances the conductivity of the metal and creates a permanent thermal coating that maintains optimal heat transfer efficiency for the life of the equipment. \nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity, and \nbetter refrigerant flow – all of which allows a system to achieve set temperatures quicker and then shut \noff, unload or throttle back. \nThe indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment \ninclude reduced run time, less kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, superior lubrication, \nless metallic wear and longer overall equipment life.\nEnergy Science Division\nOIL BUILD-UP\nOIL REMOVED\nBEFORE TREATMENT\nAFTER TREATMENT\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 500, "chars": 2366, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_073_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:c91281f81ae349ace90b66e54ef60fc3ad3d002dd52439bcb0f2b5d2995aaf58"}

Detailed forensic performance testing (outlined \nlater in this report) was performed on one 7.5 ton HVAC Equipment Manufacturer DX unit equipped with R-22 refrigerant. \nImmediately following the baseline testing, the unit was treated \nwith the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® product \nformulated for R-22 DX systems.  Since there were no other \nECM’s going on during this pilot project, the improvement in \nefficiency and restored capacity gained directly at the unit is \nsolely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The unit now \nprovides cooler/drier supply air while using less power.  This \ngreater operational efficiency is due to the restoration of the heat \ntransfer ability of the evaporator and condenser coils.\nFollowing treatment of PermaFrost NMR® the unit showed a \nsubstantial increase in coil capacity of 17,460 Btuh or 26.9% \nimprovement overall system efficiency.  This restored capacity \nequates to 1.5 tons.  The unit also showed a substantial reduction \nin Watts/Ton of 24.4% and a 26.9% improvement in the Enthalpy \nDelta.  Additionally, the unit showed a 32.3% improvement in \nEER.  The Delta T improved by 25.9% which is another \nmeasurable way to view the thermodynamic enhancement of the \nPermaFrost NMR® ECM. \nThe result of the ECM improvements is an ROI to Company B of just 6.5 months.  The tables of data and financial \ncalculations are available for review at the end of this report.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 514, "chars": 2211, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_073_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_073_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:43b53b465e5b82d0a6ec69a98b5eb24fd2745db791ae76f732ca7f6ef7dbffcc"}

Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.\nRetrofit Isolation (Option B) is defined as: All parameter measurement with the boundary of the ECM \n(PermaFrost NMR®) as the single source of measurement.  Savings are determined by field measurement of \nthe energy use of the energy conservation method affected equipment or system and any performance \nenhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained.  The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using \nmeasurements of proxies of energy use.\nThe final computation follows the formula:\nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+ - Routine adjustments + - Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 449, "chars": 2224, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_073_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_073_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:7f9ca7219e1c3f23acb0aa783afa097a529fbbfff7785bf0c6acef8bf61f177b"}
