Executive Summary
        This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure 
(ECM) PermaFrost NMR® in Miami, Florida for M.D.C.  Detailed forensic performance testing (outlined 
later in this report) was performed on one 7.5 ton HVAC Equipment Manufacturer DX unit equipped with R-22 refrigerant. 
Immediately following the baseline testing, the unit was treated 
with the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® product 
formulated for R-22 DX systems.  Since there were no other 
ECM’s going on during this pilot project, the improvement in 
efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at the unit is 
solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The unit now 
provides cooler/drier supply air while using less power.  This 
greater operational efficiency is due to the restoration of the heat 
transfer ability of the evaporator and condenser coils.
Following treatment of PermaFrost NMR® the unit showed a 
substantial increase in coil capacity of 17,460 Btuh or 26.9% 
improvement overall system efficiency.  This restored capacity 
equates to 1.5 tons.  The unit also showed a substantial reduction 
in Watts/Ton of 24.4% and a 26.9% improvement in the Enthalpy 
Delta.  Additionally, the unit showed a 32.3% improvement in 
EER.  The Delta T improved by 25.9% which is another 
measurable way to view the thermodynamic enhancement of the 
PermaFrost NMR® ECM. 
The result of the ECM improvements is an ROI to Company B of just 6.5 months.  The tables of data and financial 
calculations are available for review at the end of this report.
