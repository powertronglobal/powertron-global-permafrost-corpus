Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content of the following report will demonstrate the effects of PermaFrost NMR®’s ability to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces. 
It was determined with Company B to treat one 7.5ton DX unit.  A diagnostic examination of the 
pilot equipment is implemented to determine if the unit’s operational conditions are satisfactory.  Baseline 
measurements will be recorded and then the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® will be injected.  
The product will be allowed 4 weeks to seat itself into the metal surfaces before post measurements were 
taken to establish the efficiency gains. 
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP International Performance Measurement and 
Verification Protocol as the M&V plan.  The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global’s Senior 
Energy Engineer [Senior Energy Engineer] ME/CEM/CMC/CMVP.
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
kW = Volts X Amps * .9 Single Phase or 1.47 Three Phase / 1000
 
Delta T = Return Air DB – Supply Air DB
 
Refrigerant Approach = Supply Air DB – Saturated Evaporator Temp
 
Enthalpy =  Return Air WB Deg. F and Supply Air WB Deg. F Converted to Enthalpy
 
Actual Btuh Capacity = Measured CFM X 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta 
 
System Eﬃciency % = Actual Coil Capacity Btuh / Nominal Coil Capacity Btuh
