A return trip was made out to the unit to further demonstrate PermaFrost NMR®'s ability to maintain or 
even further improve a treated system.  This system has shown further improvement due to its age and 
annual runtime demands.
       System Eﬃciency or BTUH:
4000 CFM x 4.5 (constant) X 5.93 (enthalpy Delta Post 2)= 106,740 BTU
106,740 BTUH / 92,000 (Nominal Capacity BTUH) = 116% 
The reason for the 116% total system efficiency improvement is due to the fact that the condensing unit is a 
7.7 (92,000 BTUH) ton and the air handler is a 10 (120,000 BTUH) ton unit.  This unit has improved in 
overall system efficiency from Post 1 to Post 2 by additional 24,480 BTUH or additional 29.8%.  This is due 
to allowing more "seating" time for PermaFrost NMR® to further penetrate all heat exchange surfaces.
