Detailed forensic performance testing\n(outlined later in this report) was performed on the two 10-ton air cooled Liebert units using R-22\nrefrigerant. [Government Services Director], Deputy Director of Government Services for [Energy Services Company], personally witnessed\nall phases of the testing and data collection.\n \nThe pilot units were both installed in June of 2007. Unit #2 has 19,500 hours of runtime and Unit #3,\nwhich also helps cool a small power room adjacent to the Data Control Center, has 29,500 hours of runtime.\nImmediately following the baseline testing, both units were treated with the proper amount and type of\nPermaFrost NMR® product formulated for R-22 DX systems.\n  \nSince there were no other ECM’s going on during this pilot project, the improvement in efficiency and \nrestored capacity gained directly at the units is solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.   The \nCRAC units now provide colder and drier supply air while using less power. This greater operational \nefficiency is due to the restoration of the heat transfer ability of the evaporator and condenser coils.  \nFollowing treatment with PermaFrost NMR® and properly adjusting for the slightly cooler outside post \ntreatment temperatures, the two CRAC units showed an average 17.9% reduction in kW and a 4% reduction \nin Amps while at the same time producing an increase in coil capacity of 27,540 Btuh or 13.9% more \ntonnage.  The units also showed a substantial reduction in Watts/Ton of 17.9% and a 15.9% improvement in \nthe Enthalpy Delta.  Additionally, the two CRAC units showed an average of 22.3% improvement in EER, \nwhich is another measurable way to view the thermodynamic enhancement of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  \nThe result of the average ECM improvements is an ROI to Military Base A of just 14.2 months based on the runtime \ninformation taken directly off the runtime hours log of both units.  The tables of data and financial \ncalculations are available for review at the end of this report.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 717, "chars": 3195, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_013_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:60ef2f50e4840c2ac00d1b7996b7a4daa8c87cf195e3534489484b536a6e8669"}

A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any \ntype of system in which it is installed – DX (direct expansion air and chilled water systems), Chillers \n(screw, reciprocating, scroll and centrifugal), heat pumps, ice making equipment.  Specialized \napplications include computer room cooling and dehumidification systems, chiller plants (water and ice \nproduction applications), domestic and industrial refrigeration (ammonia low and ultra low \ntemperature), air-cooled single application water chillers and split and package rooftop HVAC \nequipment.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and \nimproved refrigerant velocity – all of which allows a system to achieve set point temperatures in a more \nrapid fashion which reduces system loading and operating periods.  The indirect benefits resulting from \nthe enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW \nhours used, less amp draw at the compressor, less metallic wear, longer overall equipment life and a \nreduced carbon footprint for the Air Force.\nEnergy Science Division\nOIL BUILD-UP\nOIL REMOVED\nBEFORE TREATMENT\nAFTER TREATMENT\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 442, "chars": 2106, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_013_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_013_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:8996c91eb8b98f9b0c18a82898e9614dcf33a61f466c428b23da53c9fd7ac9f2"}

The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and \nAir-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the \nIPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and \nproducts.\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize.  They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.  Option B is \ndefined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single \nsource of measurement.  Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM \naffected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained.  The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using \nmeasurements of proxies of energy use. \nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+ - Routine adjustments + - Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 434, "chars": 2131, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_013_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_013_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:f39f83cb13cb42a7e5b1c61229c6a9b19a18dafb25e8ff6423795213f00e6b13"}
