Energy Reporting Period (Post)
The identical IPMVP data recordings from the baseline were recorded on 9/20/2012 using the same 
recently NIST calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy.  Given the 9% cooler outside air 
temperature in the Post, the compressors Amps (70% of the total Amps) were adjusted upward by the same 
percentage.  This adjustment permeates through to the Post Total Watts as well as the Watts per Ton. The 
measurements are as follows:

The following are the final calculated performance measurements (detailed below the chart) after 
performing the regression analysis to account to the restored capacity brought about by PermaFrost NMR®.
