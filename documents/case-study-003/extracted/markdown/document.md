PermaFrost NMR® Performance Report
Data Center Computer Room Air Conditioners (CRAC)

September 22, 2012

Executive Summary

TThis report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure

(ECM) PermaFrost NMR® in the two primary CRAC units supporting the Defense Information Systems

Agency Data Control Center at Military Base A in MD.  Detailed forensic performance testing

(outlined later in this report) was performed on the two 10-ton air cooled Liebert units using R-22

refrigerant. [Government Services Director], Deputy Director of Government Services for [Energy Services Company], personally witnessed

all phases of the testing and data collection.

The pilot units were both installed in June of 2007. Unit #2 has 19,500 hours of runtime and Unit #3,

which also helps cool a small power room adjacent to the Data Control Center, has 29,500 hours of runtime.

Immediately following the baseline testing, both units were treated with the proper amount and type of

PermaFrost NMR® product formulated for R-22 DX systems.

Since there were no other ECM’s going on during this pilot project, the improvement in efficiency and

restored capacity gained directly at the units is solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.   The

CRAC units now provide colder and drier supply air while using less power. This greater operational

efficiency is due to the restoration of the heat transfer ability of the evaporator and condenser coils.

Following treatment with PermaFrost NMR® and properly adjusting for the slightly cooler outside post

treatment temperatures, the two CRAC units showed an average 17.9% reduction in kW and a 4% reduction

in Amps while at the same time producing an increase in coil capacity of 27,540 Btuh or 13.9% more

tonnage.  The units also showed a substantial reduction in Watts/Ton of 17.9% and a 15.9% improvement in

the Enthalpy Delta.  Additionally, the two CRAC units showed an average of 22.3% improvement in EER,

which is another measurable way to view the thermodynamic enhancement of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.

The result of the average ECM improvements is an ROI to Military Base A of just 14.2 months based on the runtime

information taken directly off the runtime hours log of both units.  The tables of data and financial

calculations are available for review at the end of this report.

Product Brief

PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure

(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) technology as its core agent.  A sustainable,

one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any

type of system in which it is installed – DX (direct expansion air and chilled water systems), Chillers

(screw, reciprocating, scroll and centrifugal), heat pumps, ice making equipment.  Specialized

applications include computer room cooling and dehumidification systems, chiller plants (water and ice

production applications), domestic and industrial refrigeration (ammonia low and ultra low

temperature), air-cooled single application water chillers and split and package rooftop HVAC

equipment.

The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and

improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allows a system to achieve set point temperatures in a more

rapid fashion which reduces system loading and operating periods.  The indirect benefits resulting from

the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW

hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, less metallic wear, longer overall equipment life and a

reduced carbon footprint for the Air Force.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol

The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocols (IPMVP) are used to develop this

report.  The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and

Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the

IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and

products.

There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize.  They

are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.  Option B is

defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single

source of measurement.  Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM

affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.

Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the

savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term

measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained.  The savings are calculated by

short-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using

measurements of proxies of energy use.

The final computation follows the formula:

Energy Science Division

Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy

+ - Routine adjustments + - Non-Routine Adjustments

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content

The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the

effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces.

A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the unit’s operational

conditions were satisfactory.  Baseline measurements were recorded and then the proper amount and type

of PermaFrost NMR® was injected.  The product was then allowed four (4) weeks to seat itself into the

metal surfaces before post measurements were taken again to establish the efficiency gains.

The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP International Performance Measurement and

Verification Protocol as the M&V plan.  The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global’s Senior

Energy Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer], ME/CEM/CMC/CMVP and witnessed by [Senior Mechanical Technician], Senior

Mechanical Technician for the Military Air Wing based at Military Base A.

The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:

kW = Volts * Amps * 1.47 (Power Factor .85 *1.732) - for 3-Phase

Delta T = Return Air DB – Supply Air DB

Enthalpy = Return Air WB Deg. F and Supply Air WB Deg. F converted to Enthalpy

Actual Btuh Capacity = Measured CFM * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta (Baseline – Post)

System Eﬃciency % = Actual Coil Capacity Btuh / Nominal Coil Capacity Btuh

EER = Btuh / Adjusted Watts

Energy Reporting Period (Post)

The identical IPMVP data recordings from the baseline were recorded on 9/20/2012 using the same

recently NIST calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy.  Given the 9% cooler outside air

temperature in the Post, the compressors Amps (70% of the total Amps) were adjusted upward by the same

percentage.  This adjustment permeates through to the Post Total Watts as well as the Watts per Ton. The

measurements are as follows:

Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to determine a very accurate ROI for

the Air Force for implementing this ECM:

Baseline kWh = (13,292 CTW / 1,000) * 3,920 Annual Operating Hrs = 52,105 kWh

Baseline Cost To Run = 52,105 kWh * $.11 = $5,732

Regression Analysis is then used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Pilot Unit

Adjusted Base Tonnage = 9.51 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)

Adjusted Total Watts = 1,499 WPT * 9.51 tons = 14,255 TW

Adjusted Base kWh = (14,255 TW/1,000) * 3,920 Annual Operating Hrs = 55,880 kWh

Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM = 55,880 kWh * $.11 = $6,147

Post ECM kWh = (12,468 NTW / 1,000) * 3,920 Annual Operating Hrs = 48,875 kWh

Cost to Run After ECM = 48,875 kWh * $.11 = $5,376

Cost Savings per Month = ($6,147 - $5,376) / 12 = $64.25

Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed @ $1,250 / $64.25 = 19.5

ROI = 19.5 months
