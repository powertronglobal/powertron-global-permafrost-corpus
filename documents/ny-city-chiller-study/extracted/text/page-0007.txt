Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the chiller.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 1119.3 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: .69 kW/ton * 1,254.4 tons = 865.5kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 865.5 kW * 1,000 Annual Operating Hrs = 865,500 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 865,500 kWh * $.13 = $112,515
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: .55 kW/ton * 1,254.4 tons = 689.9 kW
Annual kWh Post: 689.9 kW * 1,000 hours = 689,900 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 689,900 kWh * .13 cents = $89,687
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $112,515 - $89,687 = $22,828
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $22,828 / 12 = $1,902
Initial Payback Period
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot chiller: $6,153
Estimated ROI Period for the chiller: $6,153 / $1,902= 3.2 months
Annual Rate of Return = 371%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 1855%
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for  
implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy savings 
resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post 
Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller was when operating at the original energy 
profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run 
the chiller at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the 
most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours or load the chiller will now operate due to the 
restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the chiller to reach the internal building set points with increased 
efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
