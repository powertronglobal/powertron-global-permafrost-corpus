Recovered Unit Cost with ECM – Chiller#4
The “Unit Cost” in the HVAC industry is the kw/ton 
ratio. kW/ton is commonly used for larger commercial 
and industrial air-conditioning, heat pump and 
refrigeration systems. It is the HVAC industry’s 
standard of determining how much energy is required to 
create 1 ton of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you 
reduce your unit cost of cooling you are saving energy 
regardless of how much overall cooling you require.
The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration the ECM created in the treated chiller. The 
average cost to operate this chiller before it was treated 
with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in kW/ton, was 
.69 kW/Ton.
The specific cost to operate this chiller after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, is currently .55 kW/Ton.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate for a 27-year-old chiller utilizing R-22 refrigerant. The 
post results are also in line with the average improvement savings shown over more than 130,000 
installations globally.
