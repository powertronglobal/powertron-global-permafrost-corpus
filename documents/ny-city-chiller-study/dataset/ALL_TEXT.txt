HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report
Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study
The purpose of this study is to verify the industry wide problem of efficiency loss in HVAC/R as projected by 
ASHRAE research and to quantify the amount of money wasted due to this loss. Many industry leading 
organizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age. 
Thermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVAC/R equipment that operates as a 
vapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and oil for lubrication. This thermal degradation is well 
documented by the HVAC/R industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal 
degradation prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times 
and additional kWh consumption.
The chiller in this study is representative of a great majority of the portfolio of equipment operated by the 
customer. If thermal degradation is present in this chiller it is present in the entire inventory of equipment. 
Energy waste can be calculated based on this equipment (portfolio representation) and then accurately 
extrapolated across the entire inventory of equipment.
Process
This report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of one chiller that 
support the location in New York City. 
Detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the chiller before and after the 
installation of the ECM to determine the impact on the three key elements that greatly affect the HVAC power 
bill as they relate to the original design specifications:
1. The cooling capacity the chiller produces after 27 years in service, before and after the
administration of the ECM.
2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the chiller can deliver as
reflected in the kW/ton measurement, before and after the administration of the ECM.
3. The thermal dynamic ability of the chiller to perform in relation to operational design, before and
after the administration of the ECM.

Methodology
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the 
IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted [Chief Engineer] 
Chief Engineer with customer, [Energy Consultant] P.E. with Energy Consulting Partner and Powertron Global’s 
Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer].  
Notes
The equipment tested 1350 water-cooled chiller manufactured by Trane.  Both the baseline and post measurement s were 
taken with outside air temperatures of 81-82 degrees F.  
The flow rate through the evaporator was set close to design specifications in the baseline and post and the return chilled 
water entering the chiller in the baseline and post were identical so no adjustments were made.
The boundary of the testing was the chiller and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance 
calculations is very high.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the chiller to perform prior to the 
PermaFrost NMR® (ECM) being installed, as well as illustrate the amount of thermal degradation due in large 
part to oil migration within the heat exchangers.
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase)
• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU
• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Water Temp – Saturated Evaporator Temp (CH)
Notes
Following a diagnostic examination to determine the operational condition of the chiller was satisfactory, Baseline M&V 
data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. 350+ runtime hours after installation of the ECM, the M&V team 
returned on a very similar weather day to the Baseline to take Post M&V measurements in the identical fashion as in the 
Baseline. The delta of these measurements and associated calculations show the amount of capacity restored.
The following IPMVP data points were recorded on 30 July 2015 using the flow meter shown below, recently calibrated 
by NIST (National Institutes of Standards and Technology) to insure GPM measurement accuracy. The chiller was then 
treated with PermaFrost NMR® on the same day and allowed to run normally until 4 September 2015 to ensure the 
patented surface science nanotechnology had ample time to seat into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All 
measurements were taken at identical incoming water temperatures as well as very similar outdoor air temperatures. 
The collection of the data, in both the baseline and post periods, was witnessed by customer, E.R.S. and Powertron 
Global.

Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results 
Chiller Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Customer has the problem of thermal degradation in its Chillers. The lower operating tonnage and COP 
ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. 
The degraded equipment performance is costing significant money and wasting energy. The chiller is using 
significantly more energy to operate than when it was new. 
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the chiller in the baseline and post 
testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. 
The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 135 operating tons and an 
improvement of 25.3% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the chiller 
throughout the year.

Recovered Unit Cost with ECM – Chiller#4
The “Unit Cost” in the HVAC industry is the kw/ton 
ratio. kW/ton is commonly used for larger commercial 
and industrial air-conditioning, heat pump and 
refrigeration systems. It is the HVAC industry’s 
standard of determining how much energy is required to 
create 1 ton of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you 
reduce your unit cost of cooling you are saving energy 
regardless of how much overall cooling you require.
The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration the ECM created in the treated chiller. The 
average cost to operate this chiller before it was treated 
with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in kW/ton, was 
.69 kW/Ton.
The specific cost to operate this chiller after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, is currently .55 kW/Ton.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate for a 27-year-old chiller utilizing R-22 refrigerant. The 
post results are also in line with the average improvement savings shown over more than 130,000 
installations globally.

Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the chiller.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 1119.3 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: .69 kW/ton * 1,254.4 tons = 865.5kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 865.5 kW * 1,000 Annual Operating Hrs = 865,500 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 865,500 kWh * $.13 = $112,515
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: .55 kW/ton * 1,254.4 tons = 689.9 kW
Annual kWh Post: 689.9 kW * 1,000 hours = 689,900 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 689,900 kWh * .13 cents = $89,687
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $112,515 - $89,687 = $22,828
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $22,828 / 12 = $1,902
Initial Payback Period
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot chiller: $6,153
Estimated ROI Period for the chiller: $6,153 / $1,902= 3.2 months
Annual Rate of Return = 371%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 1855%
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for  
implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy savings 
resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post 
Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller was when operating at the original energy 
profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run 
the chiller at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the 
most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours or load the chiller will now operate due to the 
restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the chiller to reach the internal building set points with increased 
efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.

Customer is Saving More than Just Energy
By treating the pilot chiller with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the current manner in which the customer 
operates the chiller, it will save approximately 175,600 kWh per year and all the costs associated with those 
savings. From an environmental impact standpoint, customer is also benefitting the surrounding 
community of [NYC Location]. Imagine how great the environmental impact will be when customer moves 
forward with treating all their HVAC/R equipment in all their properties across their portfolio.
The 175,600 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 121 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from 
being released or any of the following:
Annual greenhouse emissions from:
