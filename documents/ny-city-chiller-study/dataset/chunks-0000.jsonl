Many industry leading \norganizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age. \nThermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVAC/R equipment that operates as a \nvapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and oil for lubrication. This thermal degradation is well \ndocumented by the HVAC/R industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal \ndegradation prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times \nand additional kWh consumption.\nThe chiller in this study is representative of a great majority of the portfolio of equipment operated by the \ncustomer. If thermal degradation is present in this chiller it is present in the entire inventory of equipment. \nEnergy waste can be calculated based on this equipment (portfolio representation) and then accurately \nextrapolated across the entire inventory of equipment.\nProcess\nThis report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of one chiller that \nsupport the location in New York City. \nDetailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the chiller before and after the \ninstallation of the ECM to determine the impact on the three key elements that greatly affect the HVAC power \nbill as they relate to the original design specifications:\n1. The cooling capacity the chiller produces after 27 years in service, before and after the\nadministration of the ECM.\n2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the chiller can deliver as\nreflected in the kW/ton measurement, before and after the administration of the ECM.\n3. The thermal dynamic ability of the chiller to perform in relation to operational design, before and\nafter the administration of the ECM.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 666, "chars": 3187, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "dataroom_002_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:8c99cec034dee0276132832de45b224e8617d42ae3d3c5ebe7c45dfd6c762c61"}

Both the baseline and post measurement s were \ntaken with outside air temperatures of 81-82 degrees F.  \nThe flow rate through the evaporator was set close to design specifications in the baseline and post and the return chilled \nwater entering the chiller in the baseline and post were identical so no adjustments were made.\nThe boundary of the testing was the chiller and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance \ncalculations is very high.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\n3\nEnergy Conservation Method (ECM)\nThe content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the chiller to perform prior to the \nPermaFrost NMR® (ECM) being installed, as well as illustrate the amount of thermal degradation due in large \npart to oil migration within the heat exchangers.\nThe following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. \nThe results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:\n• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase)\n• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage\n• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)\n• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU\n• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Water Temp – Saturated Evaporator Temp (CH)\nNotes\nFollowing a diagnostic examination to determine the operational condition of the chiller was satisfactory, Baseline M&V \ndata was collected and recorded by the M&V team. 350+ runtime hours after installation of the ECM, the M&V team \nreturned on a very similar weather day to the Baseline to take Post M&V measurements in the identical fashion as in the \nBaseline. The delta of these measurements and associated calculations show the amount of capacity restored.\nThe following IPMVP data points were recorded on 30 July 2015 using the flow meter shown below, recently calibrated \nby NIST (National Institutes of Standards and Technology) to insure GPM measurement accuracy. The chiller was then \ntreated with PermaFrost NMR® on the same day and allowed to run normally until 4 September 2015 to ensure the \npatented surface science nanotechnology had ample time to seat into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All \nmeasurements were taken at identical incoming water temperatures as well as very similar outdoor air temperatures. \nThe collection of the data, in both the baseline and post periods, was witnessed by customer, E.R.S. and Powertron \nGlobal.", "tokens": 782, "chars": 3559, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_002_chunk_0001", "next_id": "dataroom_002_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:1c2dc3cf2486a773dad216fd7e76ba2898de9607e0746c13019e63d020227047"}

It is the HVAC industry’s \nstandard of determining how much energy is required to \ncreate 1 ton of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you \nreduce your unit cost of cooling you are saving energy \nregardless of how much overall cooling you require.\nThe chart to the right illustrates the performance \nrestoration the ECM created in the treated chiller. The \naverage cost to operate this chiller before it was treated \nwith PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in kW/ton, was \n.69 kW/Ton.\nThe specific cost to operate this chiller after it was \ntreated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in \nkW/ton, is currently .55 kW/Ton.\nThe higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of \nperformance efficiency and cost to operate estimate for a 27-year-old chiller utilizing R-22 refrigerant.

This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post \nAnalysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller was when operating at the original energy \nprofile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run \nthe chiller at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the \nmost widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours or load the chiller will now operate due to the \nrestored capacity. This restored capacity allows the chiller to reach the internal building set points with increased \nefficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.\n6\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 623, "chars": 2518, "pages": {"start": 6, "end": 7}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_002_chunk_0004", "next_id": "dataroom_002_chunk_0006", "content_hash": "sha256:7e2351c8d58409417287e27d4acc49e35ddc1ef8e2b8bfede25dd02de3a656db"}
