Detailed \nforensic performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on a nominal 50-ton water cooled \npackage unit using R22 refrigerant serving the 4th floor of the facility.  Following testing, the unit was \ntreated with the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® product formulated for DX systems.\n  \nThe substantial improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at the unit was solely \nattributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The unit now provides cooler supply air with greater efficiency \ndue to the restoration of the heat transfer ability of the evaporator and condenser coils, both of which have a \ndirect correlation to an increase in the number of Btuh the machine is now capable of producing. \n \nTotal system efficiency across the pilot unit improved by 32.3%, while the EER rating of the unit rose by \n39.9%.  There was an overall increase in coil capacity of 166,500 Btuh, equating to the restoration of 13.9 tons \nof capacity or 32.2%.  There is also a reduction of 28.6% in both total power and watts per ton, which is \nanother measurable way to view the thermodynamic enhancement of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The \nresult of the average ECM improvements is an ROI to Major Spice Manufacturer & Company of just 10.1 months based on \nthe runtime information provided by the on-site senior mechanical technician.  The tables of data and \nfinancial calculations are available for review at the end of this report.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 574, "chars": 2632, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_079_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:e2ac6dc119bc251d4facbe6fca0288a4dd5b57e849565daf68171f0173237ff7"}

A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any \ntype of system in which it is installed – DX (direct expansion air and chilled water systems), Chillers \n(screw, reciprocating, scroll and centrifugal), heat pumps, ice making equipment.  Specialized \napplications include computer room cooling and dehumidification systems, chiller plants (water and ice \nproduction applications), domestic and industrial refrigeration (ammonia low and ultra low \ntemperature), air-cooled single application water chillers and split and package rooftop HVAC \nequipment.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and \nimproved refrigerant velocity – all of which allows a system to achieve set point temperatures in a more \nrapid fashion which reduces system loading and operating periods.  The indirect benefits resulting from \nthe enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW \nhours used, less amp draw at the compressor, less metallic wear, longer overall equipment life and a \nreduced carbon footprint.\nEnergy Science Division\nOIL BUILD-UP\nOIL REMOVED\nBEFORE TREATMENT\nAFTER TREATMENT\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 427, "chars": 2031, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_079_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_079_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:e67e8023476aa67bf5338f2be7e796e4d56f4f0fb7f2dafafaaebf7bac808e9e"}

The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and \nAir-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the \nIPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and \nproducts.\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize.  They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.  Option B is \ndefined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single \nsource of measurement.  Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM \naffected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained.  The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using \nmeasurements of proxies of energy use. \nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+ - Routine adjustments + - Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 433, "chars": 2123, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_079_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_079_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:b3832a2f86447e5878f1c76d1e8de3c099971ff3e43bf593be89dc2970b350fa"}
