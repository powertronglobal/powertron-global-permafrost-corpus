PermaFrost NMR® Performance Report

Major Spice Manufacturer & Company

September 22, 2012

Executive Summary

This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure

(ECM) PermaFrost NMR® at the Major Spice Manufacturer & Company facility located in Hunt Valley, MD.  Detailed

forensic performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on a nominal 50-ton water cooled

package unit using R22 refrigerant serving the 4th floor of the facility.  Following testing, the unit was

treated with the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® product formulated for DX systems.

The substantial improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at the unit was solely

attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The unit now provides cooler supply air with greater efficiency

due to the restoration of the heat transfer ability of the evaporator and condenser coils, both of which have a

direct correlation to an increase in the number of Btuh the machine is now capable of producing.

Total system efficiency across the pilot unit improved by 32.3%, while the EER rating of the unit rose by

39.9%.  There was an overall increase in coil capacity of 166,500 Btuh, equating to the restoration of 13.9 tons

of capacity or 32.2%.  There is also a reduction of 28.6% in both total power and watts per ton, which is

another measurable way to view the thermodynamic enhancement of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The

result of the average ECM improvements is an ROI to Major Spice Manufacturer & Company of just 10.1 months based on

the runtime information provided by the on-site senior mechanical technician.  The tables of data and

financial calculations are available for review at the end of this report.

Product Brief

PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure

(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) technology as its core agent. A sustainable,

one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any

type of system in which it is installed – DX (direct expansion air and chilled water systems), Chillers

(screw, reciprocating, scroll and centrifugal), heat pumps, ice making equipment.  Specialized

applications include computer room cooling and dehumidification systems, chiller plants (water and ice

production applications), domestic and industrial refrigeration (ammonia low and ultra low

temperature), air-cooled single application water chillers and split and package rooftop HVAC

equipment.

The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and

improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allows a system to achieve set point temperatures in a more

rapid fashion which reduces system loading and operating periods.  The indirect benefits resulting from

the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW

hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, less metallic wear, longer overall equipment life and a

reduced carbon footprint.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol

The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocols (IPMVP) are used to develop this

report.  The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and

Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the

IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and

products.

There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize.  They

are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.  Option B is

defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single

source of measurement.  Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM

affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.

Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the

savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term

measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained.  The savings are calculated by

short-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using

measurements of proxies of energy use.

The final computation follows the formula:

Energy Science Division

Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy

+ - Routine adjustments + - Non-Routine Adjustments

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content

The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the

effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces.

A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the unit’s operational

conditions were satisfactory.  Baseline measurements were recorded and then the proper amount and type

of PermaFrost NMR™ was injected. The product was then allowed four (4) weeks to seat itself into the

metal surfaces before post measurements were taken again to establish the efficiency gains.

The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP International Performance Measurement and

Verification Protocol as the M&V plan.  The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global’s Senior

Energy Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer], ME/CEM/CMC/CMVP and witnessed by [Client Representative], Senior

Mechanical Technician for Major Spice Manufacturer & Company.

The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:

kW = Volts * Amps * 1.47 (Power Factor .85 *1.732) - for 3-Phase

Delta T = Return Air DB – Supply Air DB

Enthalpy = Return Air WB Deg. F and Supply Air WB Deg. F Converted to Enthalpy

Actual Btuh Capacity = Measured CFM * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta (Baseline – Post)

System Eﬃciency % =  Actual Coil Capacity Btuh / Nominal Coil Capacity Btuh

EER = Btuh / Adjusted Watts

Energy Reporting Period (Post)

The identical IPMVP data recordings from the baseline (including insertion depths with probes) were

recorded on 9/20/2012 using the same recently NIST calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy.

Since both the Return Air Temp and Incoming Condenser Water Temps were the same in Baseline and

Energy Reporting Periods, no adjustments to AMPS were necessary.  The measurements are as follows:

Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to determine a very accurate ROI for

Major Spice Manufacturer & Company for implementing this ECM:

Baseline kWh = (62,900 CTW / 1,000) * 2,400 Annual Operating Hrs = 150,960 kWh

Baseline Cost To Run = 150,960 kWh * $.11 = $16,606

Regression Analysis is then used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Pilot Unit

Adjusted Base Tonnage = 56.85 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)

Adjusted Total Watts = 1,464 WPT * 56.85 tons = 83,228 TW

Adjusted Base kWh = (83,228 TW/1,000) * 2,400 Annual Operating Hrs = 199,699 kWh

Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM = 199,699 kWh * $.11 = $21,967

Post ECM kWh = (59,465 CTW / 1,000) * 2,400 Annual Operating Hrs = 142,716 kWh

Cost to Run After ECM = 142,716 kWh * $.11 = $15,699

Cost Savings per Month = ($21,967 - $15,699) / 12 = $522.33

Cost of PermaFrost NMR™ installed @ $5,250 / $522.33 = 10.1

ROI = 10.1 months
