Energy Reporting Period (Post)
The identical IPMVP data recordings from the baseline (including insertion depths with probes) were 
recorded on 9/20/2012 using the same recently NIST calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. 
Since both the Return Air Temp and Incoming Condenser Water Temps were the same in Baseline and 
Energy Reporting Periods, no adjustments to AMPS were necessary.  The measurements are as follows:

The following are the final calculated performance measurements (detailed below the chart) after performing 
the regression analysis to account to the restored capacity brought about by PermaFrost NMR®.
