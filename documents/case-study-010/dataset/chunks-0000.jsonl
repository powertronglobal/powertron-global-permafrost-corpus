The detailed performance testing (outlined \nlater in this report) was performed on the PU before (baseline) and after (post) the installation of PermaFrost \nNMR®. \nThis testing determined the impact on three key elements relating to the original design specifications that \ngreatly affect the HVAC portion of the Beverage Company B Factory power bill.

The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling the PU is delivering as  \n \nreflected in the kWEnergy / kWRefrigeration measurement. \n \n3.

This same pilot PU was determined to be performing at an average of \n42% of the original design efficiency in the baseline. The actual design rated tonnage of the PU is 70.34 kWR. In \nactuality, the PU was only producing a total of 29.69 kWR of cooling at the start of the pilot. Approximately half \nof this 58% efficiency loss is directly attributable to the thermal degradation of the heat exchange surfaces over \na short period of time. This is due in large part to thermal degradation which creates an insulating barrier to heat \ntransfer on the tube walls (inside the tube on a Direct Expansion system and outside the tube on a flooded \nevaporator chiller). The remaining efficiency loss is a result of the reduced inlet and outlet air ducting \nconfiguration used in conjunction with this and all the other PU’s in the factory. The actual airflow across the \ncoil in the PU is only about 50% of design so the focus of this in-situ pilot will be on the improvement delta \nover the baseline rather than against design.\nAfter the ECM was installed, the average efficiency in the PU increased to 52% of design specifications, \nequating to 36.87 kWR. The restoration of 8.44 kWR represents a 28.4% increase in capacity.   \n \nCost to Beverage Company to Operate the Tea Factory HVAC PU Baseline vs Post\nThe degraded capacity described above prior to PermaFrost NMR® being implemented was costing the Tea \nFactory a similar amount in the way of wasted energy each hour the PU was operating. The average cost to \noperate the pilot PU as calculated in kWE/kWR was 0.64 in the Baseline. When new, the kWE/kWR rating for \nunits like these usually ranges from 0.25 – 0.35 kWE/kWR when the proper sized ducting is used.\n \nThe restored average kWE/kWR rating following the ECM is now 0.51. This represents a 20.3% reduction in \nenergy costs from the baseline for every kWR of cooling produced. This will result in an initial payback period \n(IPP) to the Tea Factory of 23.64 months and an internal rate of Return (IRR) of 54.3%. Extrapolated out over \njust the next five (5) years, this ECM project will net the Tea Factory a substantial ROI of 272% on their \ninvestment. These accumulated savings will greatly reduce the eventual CapEx costs to replace the PU’s when \nthey finally reach the end of their useful life.", "tokens": 755, "chars": 3143, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_018_chunk_0003", "next_id": "pdf_018_chunk_0005", "content_hash": "sha256:364ebfa645179950efb897bc1db61b980cc7b581430a0d434eeb7906e4c1c5de"}
