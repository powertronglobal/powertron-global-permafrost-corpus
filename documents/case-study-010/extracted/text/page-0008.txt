Return On Investment
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the Tea Factory PU.
 
Baseline Energy Consumption
Adjusted Baseline Capacity: 38.09 kWR
Adjusted kW Baseline: 0.64 kWE/kWR * 38.09 kWR = 24.38 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 24.38  kW * 4,080 Annual Operating Hrs = 99,470 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 99,470 kWh * R1.10 = R109,417
 
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: 0.51 kWE/kWR * 38.09 kWR = 19.43 kW
Annual kWh Post: 19.43 kW * 4,080 hours = 79,274 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 79,274 kWh * R1.10 = R87,201
 
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: R109,417 - R87,201 = R22,216
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: R22,216/ 12 = R1,851
 
Initial Payback Period
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot PU: R42,000
Estimated Initial Payback Period on the PU: R42,000 / R1,851= 22.69 months
Total kWh saved by treating this PU = 20,196
 
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period 
for the Tea Factory for implementing the PermaFrost NMR®, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the 
true energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh 
expended in the Avoided Energy Reporting (Post) Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run 
the systems was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available 
tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the 
PermaFrost NMR® was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the 
reduced number of hours the systems will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the 
systems to reach the internal building set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand 
loading.
