Recovered Wasted Energy with PermaFrost NMR®
The chart to the right illustrates the performance
restoration PermaFrost NMR® created in the treated 
PU. The average cost to operate this PU before 
it was treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as 
calculated in kWE/kWR, was 0.64.
The specific cost to operate this PU after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated 
in kkWE/kWR, is currently 0.51.
After factoring in the amount of loss in this system due to improperly sized ducting, the baseline 
kWE/kWR ratings measured in-situ were expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of performance 
efficiency and cost to operate estimations for seven (7) year old equipment. The post results are also in line 
with the average improvement savings shown over more than 125,000 installations globally.
