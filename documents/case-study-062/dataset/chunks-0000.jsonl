Detailed forensic performance testing (outlined later \nin this report) was performed on the nominal 500-ton Carrier Evergreen Chiller using R22 refrigerant. \nFollowing testing, the unit was treated with the proper amount and type of the PermaFrost NMR® \ntechnology specially formulated for these types of systems.  Measurement and Verification (M&V) was \nconducted in identical fashion prior to installation and post-gestation, and was witnessed throughout by \n[Vice President Arena Operations], Vice President - Arena Operations, Regional Sports Authority, Sports Arena B \nCenter. \nThe improvement in efficiency and restored capacity \ngained directly at the chiller was solely attributable to the \nPermaFrost NMR® ECM. This is a result of the reversal of \nthermal inefficiency on heat exchange surfaces.  \nFollowing treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® \ntechnology and operating at full load amps, the chiller \nshowed an effective net average 24.4% reduction in \nkW/ton and an increase in capacity of 32.5%. Though total \nkW only dropped from 317.8 kW to 316.7 kW, the operating tonnage grew substantially from 388 tons to 514 \ntons. This means the chiller is producing 126 more tons of cooling for slightly less energy. The restored \ncapacity was also confirmed by the Carrier technicians who routinely service the chiller. [VP Arena Operations] called \nthem in to validate the results. This capacity increase from the baseline performance level resulted in an \neffective average increase in COP of 33.1%. All of these factors directly correlate to what the Sports Arena B Center \nwill realize in energy savings as they operate this chiller in the future under the same parameters.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 619, "chars": 2819, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_062_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:46c0d76acae68f1c08ab46fa42b2b8bfe32a8f24f3a7bb84f9965300d3ecd7a5"}

This represents a 57.1% improvement in approach, which is another measureable way to \ndetermine the thermodynamic enhancement brought about by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. \nThe resulting ECM performance improvements have created an ROI for the Sports Arena B Center that is measured \nin a few short months. The tables of data are available for review at the end of this report. Financial \ncalculations determining the true ROI are proprietary to Sports Arena B Center under separate cover.  \nProduct Brief\n         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure \n(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative® (NMR) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type \nof system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and equipment that \nPermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); chilled water systems \n(both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia refrigeration plants (single \ncompressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The equipment utilized in these \nsystems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single and multi-stage), scroll, \nreciprocating and screw configurations.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and\nimproved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point temperatures in a more rapid \nfashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced \nthermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW hours used, less amp \ndraw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced carbon footprint for the Sports Arena B Center.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 554, "chars": 2634, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_062_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_062_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:9dc8c1117968321cdebf1e2df42aba57d51bd3303f9d600b6335a7adffb5f661"}

The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating, \nRefrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization \n(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation \nmethods and products.\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is \ndefined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single \nsource of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM \naffected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations \nusing measurements of proxies of energy use. \nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+/ - Routine adjustments  + /- Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 445, "chars": 2207, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_062_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_062_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:102768330bd72fb58516755214a22ed1a94964241f609e3a5da6c9a63bfd79ff"}

Baseline M&V were recorded and then the proper amount and type of \nPermaFrost NMR® was injected. The gestation period for the Sports Arena B Center pilot was four weeks on this \nparticular chiller to allow it to achieve the required ~300+ hours of runtime to ensure adequate performance \nimprovement time. At the end of this gestation period, Post M&V results were taken in the identical manner \nas in the baseline. \nThe post measurements were taken on a warmer day than the baseline thereby creating slightly warmer \ncondenser water returning from the cooling tower. Though this warmer condenser water acts to hold down \nthe amount of improvement generated by the ECM, when analyzing the data no downward adjustments \nwere made to the Post amp readings.  \nThe following report produces the utilization of the International Performance Measurement and \nVerification Protocol (IPMVP) as the M&V plan.

Additionally, no fans were used \non the tower in an effort to keep the returning condenser water as warm as possible. Since the warmer \nweather in the Post would only serve to hold down the amount of improvements measured, it was decided \nthat no weather adjustments needed to be made to the calculations since the results were already very \nsubstantial.
