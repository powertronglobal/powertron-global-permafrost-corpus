PermaFrost NMR® Performance Report

Sports Arena B Center

July, 2013

Executive Summary

This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure

(ECM) PermaFrost NMR® in one of the two main chiller units supporting the Sports Arena B Center located at the

Sports Complex B in East [Northeast Location], NJ. Detailed forensic performance testing (outlined later

in this report) was performed on the nominal 500-ton Carrier Evergreen Chiller using R22 refrigerant.

Following testing, the unit was treated with the proper amount and type of the PermaFrost NMR®

technology specially formulated for these types of systems.  Measurement and Verification (M&V) was

conducted in identical fashion prior to installation and post-gestation, and was witnessed throughout by

[Vice President Arena Operations], Vice President - Arena Operations, Regional Sports Authority, Sports Arena B

Center.

The improvement in efficiency and restored capacity

gained directly at the chiller was solely attributable to the

PermaFrost NMR® ECM. This is a result of the reversal of

thermal inefficiency on heat exchange surfaces.

Following treatment with the PermaFrost NMR®

technology and operating at full load amps, the chiller

showed an effective net average 24.4% reduction in

kW/ton and an increase in capacity of 32.5%. Though total

kW only dropped from 317.8 kW to 316.7 kW, the operating tonnage grew substantially from 388 tons to 514

tons. This means the chiller is producing 126 more tons of cooling for slightly less energy. The restored

capacity was also confirmed by the Carrier technicians who routinely service the chiller. [VP Arena Operations] called

them in to validate the results. This capacity increase from the baseline performance level resulted in an

effective average increase in COP of 33.1%. All of these factors directly correlate to what the Sports Arena B Center

will realize in energy savings as they operate this chiller in the future under the same parameters.

Following treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, the refrigerant approach was also lowered

from 5.6°F to 2.4°F. This represents a 57.1% improvement in approach, which is another measureable way to

determine the thermodynamic enhancement brought about by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.

The resulting ECM performance improvements have created an ROI for the Sports Arena B Center that is measured

in a few short months. The tables of data are available for review at the end of this report. Financial

calculations determining the true ROI are proprietary to Sports Arena B Center under separate cover.

Product Brief

PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure

(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative® (NMR) technology as its core agent. A sustainable,

one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type

of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and equipment that

PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); chilled water systems

(both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia refrigeration plants (single

compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The equipment utilized in these

systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single and multi-stage), scroll,

reciprocating and screw configurations.

The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and

improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point temperatures in a more rapid

fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced

thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW hours used, less amp

draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced carbon footprint for the Sports Arena B Center.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol

The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) was utilized in the

development of this report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating,

Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization

(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation

methods and products.

There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They

are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is

defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single

source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM

affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.

Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the

savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term

measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by

short-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations

using measurements of proxies of energy use.

The final computation follows the formula:

Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content

The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the

effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces.

A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the unit’s operational

conditions were satisfactory. Baseline M&V were recorded and then the proper amount and type of

PermaFrost NMR® was injected. The gestation period for the Sports Arena B Center pilot was four weeks on this

particular chiller to allow it to achieve the required ~300+ hours of runtime to ensure adequate performance

improvement time. At the end of this gestation period, Post M&V results were taken in the identical manner

as in the baseline.

The post measurements were taken on a warmer day than the baseline thereby creating slightly warmer

condenser water returning from the cooling tower. Though this warmer condenser water acts to hold down

the amount of improvement generated by the ECM, when analyzing the data no downward adjustments

were made to the Post amp readings.

The following report produces the utilization of the International Performance Measurement and

Verification Protocol (IPMVP) as the M&V plan. [Vice President Arena Operations], Vice President - Arena Operations,

Regional Sports Authority, Sports Arena B Center witnessed the collection of all the data used in this

report. The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global®’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer,

[Senior Energy Engineer].

The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:

kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase)

kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage

Percentage Eﬃciency = Measured BTUH / Manufacturers Design BTUH

Coeﬃcient of Performance (COP) = 12 / kW per Ton / 3.412

Detailed Results for Sports Arena B Center Chiller

System Description / Design Characteristics

This unit provides comfort cooling for approximately one-third of the Sports Arena B Center located in the

Sports Complex B, east [Northeast Location], NJ. The unit runs ~3,000 hours per year according to records

kept by the on-site engineering office.

Baseline & Energy Reporting (Post) Periods

The identical IPMVP following data points were recorded for Baseline and Post on 6/10/13 and 7/15/13

respectively using recently NIST calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. Motor amps were at

103% during both data collection periods. Anticipating the weather would be warmer in the Post; during

the baseline, heaters were used inside the facility to drive the building load. Additionally, no fans were used

on the tower in an effort to keep the returning condenser water as warm as possible. Since the warmer

weather in the Post would only serve to hold down the amount of improvements measured, it was decided

that no weather adjustments needed to be made to the calculations since the results were already very

substantial. The pilot measurements are as follows:

PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for Sports Arena B Center

Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for the Sports Arena B

Center for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to account for amount

of tonnage restored to chiller. Once the percentage of improvement in capacity is determined, the kWh associated with

the chiller in the Post are then reduced by the same percentage to account for the reduced number of hours the chiller

will be required to run in the future to maintain the same set points. The cost to operate the chiller prior to introduction

of the ECM is then compared to the newly obtained cost to operate the chiller following the installation of the ECM to

determine the true Payback Period for the Sports Arena B Center.

Baseline kWh         317.8 kW * 3000 Annual Operating Hrs = 953,548 kWh

Cost to Run Baseline         953,548 kWh * $.123 = $117,286

ECM kWh         316.7 kW * 3000 Annual Operating Hrs = 949,969 kWh

Revised kWh (based on 32.5% restored capacity)         949,969 kWh * (1 - .325) = 641,180 kWh

Revised Cost to Run Post         641,180 kWh * $.123 = $78,865

Avoided Energy Costs (Savings) Per Month         ($117,286 - $78,865) / 12 = $3,201.75

Cost of ECM         $12,875

Payback Period to Sports Arena B Center         $12,875 / $ 3,201.75 = 4.02 months

ROI = 4 - 5 months
