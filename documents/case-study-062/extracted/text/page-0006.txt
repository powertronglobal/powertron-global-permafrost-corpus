       Detailed Results for Sports Arena B Center Chiller  
System Description / Design Characteristics
This unit provides comfort cooling for approximately one-third of the Sports Arena B Center located in the 
Sports Complex B, east [Northeast Location], NJ. The unit runs ~3,000 hours per year according to records 
kept by the on-site engineering office. 
Baseline & Energy Reporting (Post) Periods
The identical IPMVP following data points were recorded for Baseline and Post on 6/10/13 and 7/15/13 
respectively using recently NIST calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. Motor amps were at 
103% during both data collection periods. Anticipating the weather would be warmer in the Post; during 
the baseline, heaters were used inside the facility to drive the building load. Additionally, no fans were used 
on the tower in an effort to keep the returning condenser water as warm as possible. Since the warmer 
weather in the Post would only serve to hold down the amount of improvements measured, it was decided 
that no weather adjustments needed to be made to the calculations since the results were already very 
substantial. The pilot measurements are as follows:
