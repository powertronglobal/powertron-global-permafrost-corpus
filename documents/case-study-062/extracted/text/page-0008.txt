PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for Sports Arena B Center 
Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for the Sports Arena B 
Center for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to account for amount 
of tonnage restored to chiller. Once the percentage of improvement in capacity is determined, the kWh associated with 
the chiller in the Post are then reduced by the same percentage to account for the reduced number of hours the chiller 
will be required to run in the future to maintain the same set points. The cost to operate the chiller prior to introduction 
of the ECM is then compared to the newly obtained cost to operate the chiller following the installation of the ECM to 
determine the true Payback Period for the Sports Arena B Center.  
Baseline kWh         317.8 kW * 3000 Annual Operating Hrs = 953,548 kWh
Cost to Run Baseline         953,548 kWh * $.123 = $117,286
ECM kWh         316.7 kW * 3000 Annual Operating Hrs = 949,969 kWh
Revised kWh (based on 32.5% restored capacity)         949,969 kWh * (1 - .325) = 641,180 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Post         641,180 kWh * $.123 = $78,865
Avoided Energy Costs (Savings) Per Month         ($117,286 - $78,865) / 12 = $3,201.75
Cost of ECM         $12,875
Payback Period to Sports Arena B Center         $12,875 / $ 3,201.75 = 4.02 months
 
ROI = 4 - 5 months
