Improved Unit Cost with Both ECM’s
The “Unit Cost” in the HVAC industry is the kW/ton ratio. KW/ton is commonly used for larger commercial and 
industrial air conditioning, heat pump and refrigeration systems. It is the HVAC industry’s standard of determining 
how much energy is required to create a single ton of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you reduce the unit 
cost of cooling you are saving energy regardless of how much overall cooling is required.
The chart to the right clearly illustrates the amount of 
efﬁciency restoration the ECMs created in the pilot 
systems after treatment. The four treated pilot CRAC 
systems are now performing 28.5% more efﬁciently than 
before being treated. This degradation in operational 
efﬁciency was costing Data Center Provider/Data Center REIT a substantial amount of 
money in wasted energy.
