Highlights of the Study
Below are some of the highlights of the study comparing the four pilot CRAC systems before and after PermaFrost 
NMR® and Circuit Masters® were installed:
 
• With PermaFrost NMR® all the beneﬁts produced are directly linked to increasing capacity. When  
 
   initially tested, the pilot CRAC systems together were producing 91.6 tons of cooling. Following 
 
   installation, the cooling capacity jumped by 19.6 tons or 21.4% to 111.2 tons.
 
 
• The overall cost to produce each ton of cooling on the pilot systems dropped 28.5% from 1.58 kW/ton 
 
   in the baseline to 1.13 kW/ton after installation of the two ECMs. This means for every ton of cooling 
 
   the four pilot CRAC systems are asked to produce, Data Center Provider/Data Center REIT is spending 28.5% less to do so.
 
• The projected annual kWh’s were reduced by 370,000 or 28.5%, from 1,300,180 to 930,180.
 
• The environmental conditions inside the data center dropped 3.8 degrees from ~84 degrees to 80.2 
 
   degrees. With improved air movement in the hot aisles, this increase in capacity now has the potential 
 
   to enable the CRAC systems to better handle the growing heat load in the suite (and cycle occasionally). 
 
• The average kW dropped 13.9% from an average of 143.02 in the baseline to 123.11 in the post when 
 
   comparing ﬁve separate 24-hour blocks of time under similar outdoor air temperatures affecting the 
 
   condensing units. The true effect of these savings over time are further explained in the regression analysis.
 
• The power factor was increased in the four pilot CRAC systems by 15.9% from .728 to .844. 
The four similar CRAC cooling systems involved in the study are recorded as follows:
 
Liebert, Mfg date: 2001, R22, Nominal 30-tons, 480 volt-3 Phase, Model VH380AUAAEI
