The next graph illustrates how the Circuit Master® devices improved the Demand kVA directly at the CRAC 
systems. As stated above, if another Circuit Master® device is installed on the secondary compressor of each 
CRAC system and at each of the respective condensing units, the Demand kVA would be further reduced without 
a noticeable increase in the ROI period.
