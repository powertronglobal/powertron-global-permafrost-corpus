Environmental Changes Resulting from Increased Capacity 
The graph below illustrates the impact the 19.6 tons of additional cooling capacity produced by the PermaFrost 
NMR® ECM has had on the pilot data center suite. Although the 71 and 72 degree set points of the CRAC systems 
are still usually well below the warmest areas within the suite, the 3.8 degree reduction in average temperature 
now makes cycling of the CRAC systems more attainable.  
Energy Readings Directly from Utility Grade Meter Monitoring All Systems 
The graph below illustrates how the Circuit Master® devices installed directly to the load side contactors of the 
lead compressor on each CRAC system immediately improved the Power Factor directly at the systems and 
reduced the current draw supplied by the Utility. Savings above and beyond those achieved in this pilot are 
available at all equipment by installing additional Circuit Master® devices on the secondary compressor of each 
CRAC system and at each of the respective condensing units. Overall Power Factor of .95 or higher and these 
savings are  absolutely attainable without a noticeable increase in the Return on Investment (ROI) period.
