Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the ﬁnal calculated average performance measurements and ﬁnancial projections before and 
after the two ECM’s were installed on the four pilot CRAC systems. These results will vary slightly from the tables 
listed earlier in this report due to rounding only to the ﬁrst decimal position for cooling ton and kW values.
Average Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Capacity:  91.6 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline:  1.58 kW/ton * 111.2 tons = 175.7 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh:  175.7 kW * 7,400 Annual Operating Hours = 1,300,180 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 1,300,180 kWh * $.09 = $117,016
Average Post Energy Consumption
kW Post:  1.13 kW/ton * 111.2 tons = 125.7 kW
Annual kWh Post:  125.7 kW * 7,400 hours = 930,180 kWh
Annual Cost Post:  930,180 kWh * $.09 cents = $83,716
Average Savings Per Year Per Unit
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year:  $117,016 - $83,716 = $33,300
Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $33,300 / 12 = $2,775
Return on Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® and Circuit Master® devices installed in the pilot cooling systems: $29,428
Estimated ROI for Data Center Provider/Data Center REIT when treating the pilot cooling systems: $29,428 / $2,775 = ~10.6 mos
Additional Savings
In addition to the above savings, demand was also reduced potentially providing additional cost savings.  In order 
to identify these savings, a copy of the electric bills is required to identify the cost of demand and the additional 
cost impact these energy conservation measures provided.
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 113%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 566%
Explanation of Regression Analysis
To obtain a realistic avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Data Center Provider/Data Center REIT for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® and Circuit Master® 
ECMs, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy savings resulting from the improvement in both capacity and efficiency 
utilizing data collected during the pilot study. Working together, these improvements reduce the annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis 
Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the cooling systems was when operating at the original energy profile to produce 
the newly restored amount of available capacity before then subtracting the revised cost to run the cooling systems at the same restored capacity 
after the ECMs were installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or 
load % at which the systems will now operate due to the restored performance profile. This restored performance profile allows will normally allow 
the cooling systems to satisfy the internal area set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
