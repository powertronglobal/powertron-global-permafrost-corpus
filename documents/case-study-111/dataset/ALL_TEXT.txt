Purpose of the Study
This report is the third and ﬁnal in a series of stringent triplicate pilot testing methodologies employed by 
Data Center Provider/Data Center REIT as a requirement prior to general adoption of PermaFrost NMR®.  For this test, Circuit Master® ECM was 
added to the testing to measure the beneﬁt and ROI of using the two technologies together.  The beneﬁts are 
complementary but also mutually exclusive.  
Summaries of Previous Studies
Listed below are the summary details of the past PermaFrost NMR® pilots conducted at the Data Center Provider/Data Center REIT 
Trust (Data Center REIT) data center facilities in other cities. 
 
1. Conducted by Data Center Provider and Powertron Global in 2014 on a single 1998 Computer Room Air Conditioning 
 
(CRAC) system in a facility in New Jersey using the IPMVP (International Measurement and Veriﬁcation 
 
Protocol). The IPMVP is endorsed by the US Department of Energy as the best method to test HVAC 
 
systems in the ﬁeld for capacity and efﬁciency. This ﬁrst pilot produced an increase in capacity of 35%, an 
 
increase in COP (Coefﬁcient of Performance) of 32.5%, and an increase in efﬁciency (calculated as  
 
kW/ton) of 24.7%.
 
2. Conducted by Data Center Provider and Powertron Global in the summer of 2015, but on a much larger scale in a 
 
mission critical location in downtown [NYC Location]. The pilot involved testing and treating 35 CRAC 
 
units averaging 10-years of age using the same IPMVP methodologies as in the ﬁrst pilot. The second 
 
pilot produced an average increase in capacity across all 35 units of 24.7%, and increase in COP of 27.2%, 
 
and an increase in efﬁciency of 21.5%.
Summary of this Study
As detailed below in this report, the third pilot involved testing and treating four CRAC units and produced an 
increase of 21.4% in capacity and other very similar increases in COP and efﬁciency directly attributable to the 
PermaFrost NMR® ECM as in the previous two pilots. 
At the request of Data Center Provider/Data Center REIT, the third pilot included the Circuit Master ECM that works to save energy by better 
utilizing the incoming power to the CRAC systems. When combined with the PermaFrost NMR ECM, Circuit 
Master can create additional power savings. The combined beneﬁts of the two ECM's produced an initial payback 
of less than 12 months.
The engineering ﬁrm EET was included as an additional member of the measurement and veriﬁcation team. EET’s role 
was to provide a secondary method (detailed in this report) for documenting the energy savings produced by 
PermaFrost NMR®a nd Circuit Masters®. EET certiﬁed the accuracy of the data and the methodologies used to collect it.

 Study Overview
As demonstrated in this ﬁeld trial, PermaFrost NMR® restores the capacity on the CRAC systems lost over time 
due to fouling of the heat exchange surfaces. The Circuit Master® devices treat the power supplying these same 
CRAC systems. Working together, the ECMs beneﬁt Data Center Provider/Data Center REIT in any or all of the following ways:
 
• Restoring capacity of the CRAC systems to satisfy ﬂuctuating building loads or lower room temps
 
• Producing additional CRAC system redundancy at no extra cost or interruption to operations 
 
• Improving CRAC system efﬁciency, lowering cost to produce each ton of cooling required 
 
• Restoring thermal efﬁciency, allowing CRAC systems to achieve thermostat set points faster, reducing 
 
   runtime and extending equipment life by 15%+ 
 
• Reducing amp draw and demand charges (KVA) while increasing Power Factor utilization
 
• Producing cooler operating temperatures of compressors, reducing service calls 
The improvements demonstrated in this or any ﬁeld test resulting from PermaFrost NMR® and Circuit Master® are 
dependent on factors such as age, condition, service history, runtime of one or both compressors, and the design 
and operational application of each system. The results in this pilot were very consistent with 14+ year historical 
performance averages as well as recently successful pilots conducted at multiple Data Center Provider locations and independent 
laboratory study completed in May, 2015 on DX equipment by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) in their testing 
chambers in [Texas Location], TX.
Site Selection
The location chosen for this pilot was a separate data center suite supported by four pilot CRAC systems put into 
service in 2001.  The conﬁguration of this suite puts the major load on CRAC systems 1, 2 and 3.  CRAC system 4 
supports the least densely populated area of the main ﬂoor furthest from the entrance. At the start of the pilot, 
CRAC system 4 was the only system where the second compressor was occasionally cycling on and off. A 
temperature logger placed on top of the cable racks in the center aisle of the suite on November 11, just prior to 
the ECM’s being installed, measured temperatures averaging 84 degrees.

Highlights of the Study
Below are some of the highlights of the study comparing the four pilot CRAC systems before and after PermaFrost 
NMR® and Circuit Masters® were installed:
 
• With PermaFrost NMR® all the beneﬁts produced are directly linked to increasing capacity. When  
 
   initially tested, the pilot CRAC systems together were producing 91.6 tons of cooling. Following 
 
   installation, the cooling capacity jumped by 19.6 tons or 21.4% to 111.2 tons.
 
 
• The overall cost to produce each ton of cooling on the pilot systems dropped 28.5% from 1.58 kW/ton 
 
   in the baseline to 1.13 kW/ton after installation of the two ECMs. This means for every ton of cooling 
 
   the four pilot CRAC systems are asked to produce, Data Center Provider/Data Center REIT is spending 28.5% less to do so.
 
• The projected annual kWh’s were reduced by 370,000 or 28.5%, from 1,300,180 to 930,180.
 
• The environmental conditions inside the data center dropped 3.8 degrees from ~84 degrees to 80.2 
 
   degrees. With improved air movement in the hot aisles, this increase in capacity now has the potential 
 
   to enable the CRAC systems to better handle the growing heat load in the suite (and cycle occasionally). 
 
• The average kW dropped 13.9% from an average of 143.02 in the baseline to 123.11 in the post when 
 
   comparing ﬁve separate 24-hour blocks of time under similar outdoor air temperatures affecting the 
 
   condensing units. The true effect of these savings over time are further explained in the regression analysis.
 
• The power factor was increased in the four pilot CRAC systems by 15.9% from .728 to .844. 
The four similar CRAC cooling systems involved in the study are recorded as follows:
 
Liebert, Mfg date: 2001, R22, Nominal 30-tons, 480 volt-3 Phase, Model VH380AUAAEI

Objectives
The four key objectives for this jointly-conducted PermaFrost NMR® pilot study between EET, Powertron Global 
and Data Center Provider/Data Center REIT were all achieved.  They included: 
 
1. Determine that the “as-is” capacity and efﬁciency of the pilot CRAC systems supporting the Data Center Provider/Data Center REIT 
 
    suite had degraded by at least 10% after 14 years in operation.  
 
2. Demonstrate at least 12% performance improvement in tonnage and/or corresponding kW/ton and 
 
    energy reduction in the pilot CRAC cooling systems 250 hours or more after PermaFrost NMR® and the 
 
    Circuit Master devices were installed. 
 
3. Demonstrate the ability of the CRAC pilot systems to produce cooler, drier air as measured in both Dry 
 
    Bulb and Wet Bulb deltas after being treated.  
 
4. To support an effective business case for further deployments of the ECMs within the Data Center Provider/Data Center REIT  
    
 
    portfolio of properties, demonstrate ﬁnancial beneﬁts associated with efﬁciency improvements 
 
    realized over the duration of the study. These beneﬁts must be equivalent to a 24-month or less 
 
    payback to Data Center Provider/Data Center REIT on their initial project costs.  
ECM Product Briefs
PermaFrost NMR®
PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented surface science nanotechnology that uses 
Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR®) technology as its core agent. A 
sustainable, one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® 
lasts for the remaining life of any type of climate control system in which it is 
installed. The direct beneﬁts of PermaFrost NMR® are increased capacity 
resulting in improved system efﬁciency.  
 
Circuit Master®
Circuit Master® is a product that blocks distortions in electrical power above 
and below the normal signal range and contains line ﬁlter capacitors to improve 
power factor. This allows induction power equipment such as HVAC, 
refrigeration, motors and pumps to use less energy.  Equipment lifespan is also 
increased and maintenance costs are reduced. This equipment is installed at the 
electrical disconnect for each machine or at each compressor in a dual-circuit 
HVAC unit where both compressors run an extensive amount of time annually.

Testing Methodologies
The team used two methods to capture the performance and energy use of the four CRAC systems. First, after 
verifying the amount of air ﬂowing across the evaporator coils before beginning each pilot, the subsequent 
measurements used in the efﬁciency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with Option B of 
the IPMVP (International Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol). This Protocol was developed by experts in the 
international community and endorsed by the US Department of Energy to provide a consistent method for 
analyzing HVAC system performance. Baseline measurements were taken on November 11 with outside air 
temperatures averaging between 68-70 degrees. Post measurements were then taken in the same fashion on a 
similar weather day on December 16. 
The results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic 
engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor * Sq Rt 3 /1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• kW/ton = Actual Measured Energy / Actual Measured Capacity 
 
• Coefﬁcient of Performance (COP) = 12 / (kW/ton) /3.412
 
• Actual Cooling Capacity per Hour = (Measured CFM * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta T) / 12,000 BTU
The second method used to capture data involved installing a utility-grade power meter directly at the electrical 
panel housing only the breakers for the four pilot CRAC systems and the corresponding condensing units. The 
meter was installed on November 4 to capture one week of baseline prior to the ECM’s being installed on 
November 11. This data was then compared to data in the post (after PermaFrost NMR® had been in the systems 
for at least 250 runtime hours) in blocks of time when the weather was the same.

Improved Unit Cost with Both ECM’s
The “Unit Cost” in the HVAC industry is the kW/ton ratio. KW/ton is commonly used for larger commercial and 
industrial air conditioning, heat pump and refrigeration systems. It is the HVAC industry’s standard of determining 
how much energy is required to create a single ton of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you reduce the unit 
cost of cooling you are saving energy regardless of how much overall cooling is required.
The chart to the right clearly illustrates the amount of 
efﬁciency restoration the ECMs created in the pilot 
systems after treatment. The four treated pilot CRAC 
systems are now performing 28.5% more efﬁciently than 
before being treated. This degradation in operational 
efﬁciency was costing Data Center Provider/Data Center REIT a substantial amount of 
money in wasted energy.

Environmental Changes Resulting from Increased Capacity 
The graph below illustrates the impact the 19.6 tons of additional cooling capacity produced by the PermaFrost 
NMR® ECM has had on the pilot data center suite. Although the 71 and 72 degree set points of the CRAC systems 
are still usually well below the warmest areas within the suite, the 3.8 degree reduction in average temperature 
now makes cycling of the CRAC systems more attainable.  
Energy Readings Directly from Utility Grade Meter Monitoring All Systems 
The graph below illustrates how the Circuit Master® devices installed directly to the load side contactors of the 
lead compressor on each CRAC system immediately improved the Power Factor directly at the systems and 
reduced the current draw supplied by the Utility. Savings above and beyond those achieved in this pilot are 
available at all equipment by installing additional Circuit Master® devices on the secondary compressor of each 
CRAC system and at each of the respective condensing units. Overall Power Factor of .95 or higher and these 
savings are  absolutely attainable without a noticeable increase in the Return on Investment (ROI) period.

Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the ﬁnal calculated average performance measurements and ﬁnancial projections before and 
after the two ECM’s were installed on the four pilot CRAC systems. These results will vary slightly from the tables 
listed earlier in this report due to rounding only to the ﬁrst decimal position for cooling ton and kW values.
Average Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Capacity:  91.6 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline:  1.58 kW/ton * 111.2 tons = 175.7 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh:  175.7 kW * 7,400 Annual Operating Hours = 1,300,180 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 1,300,180 kWh * $.09 = $117,016
Average Post Energy Consumption
kW Post:  1.13 kW/ton * 111.2 tons = 125.7 kW
Annual kWh Post:  125.7 kW * 7,400 hours = 930,180 kWh
Annual Cost Post:  930,180 kWh * $.09 cents = $83,716
Average Savings Per Year Per Unit
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year:  $117,016 - $83,716 = $33,300
Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $33,300 / 12 = $2,775
Return on Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® and Circuit Master® devices installed in the pilot cooling systems: $29,428
Estimated ROI for Data Center Provider/Data Center REIT when treating the pilot cooling systems: $29,428 / $2,775 = ~10.6 mos
Additional Savings
In addition to the above savings, demand was also reduced potentially providing additional cost savings.  In order 
to identify these savings, a copy of the electric bills is required to identify the cost of demand and the additional 
cost impact these energy conservation measures provided.
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 113%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 566%
Explanation of Regression Analysis
To obtain a realistic avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Data Center Provider/Data Center REIT for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® and Circuit Master® 
ECMs, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy savings resulting from the improvement in both capacity and efficiency 
utilizing data collected during the pilot study. Working together, these improvements reduce the annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis 
Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the cooling systems was when operating at the original energy profile to produce 
the newly restored amount of available capacity before then subtracting the revised cost to run the cooling systems at the same restored capacity 
after the ECMs were installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or 
load % at which the systems will now operate due to the restored performance profile. This restored performance profile allows will normally allow 
the cooling systems to satisfy the internal area set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.

Impact on the DOE Better Business Challenge
By treating just the pilot cooling systems in [Southeast Location] with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the manner in which the 
systems are currently being operated, Data Center Provider/Data Center REIT will save approximately 370,000 kWh per year and all the costs 
associated with those savings. From an environmental impact standpoint, Data Center Provider/Data Center REIT will also beneﬁt the 
surrounding downtown [Southeast Location] area in which they operate.  Imagine the positive environmental impacts of 
treating the rest of Data Center Provider/Data Center REIT portfolio of buildings in the US and around the world.  
The 370,000 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 255 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions 
from being released or any of the following:
Annual greenhouse emissions from:
CO2 emissions from:
