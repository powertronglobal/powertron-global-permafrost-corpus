For this test, Circuit Master® ECM was \nadded to the testing to measure the beneﬁt and ROI of using the two technologies together.  The beneﬁts are \ncomplementary but also mutually exclusive.  \nSummaries of Previous Studies\nListed below are the summary details of the past PermaFrost NMR® pilots conducted at the Data Center Provider/Data Center REIT \nTrust (Data Center REIT) data center facilities in other cities. \n \n1. Conducted by Data Center Provider and Powertron Global in 2014 on a single 1998 Computer Room Air Conditioning \n \n(CRAC) system in a facility in New Jersey using the IPMVP (International Measurement and Veriﬁcation \n \nProtocol). The IPMVP is endorsed by the US Department of Energy as the best method to test HVAC \n \nsystems in the ﬁeld for capacity and efﬁciency. This ﬁrst pilot produced an increase in capacity of 35%, an \n \nincrease in COP (Coefﬁcient of Performance) of 32.5%, and an increase in efﬁciency (calculated as  \n \nkW/ton) of 24.7%.\n \n2. Conducted by Data Center Provider and Powertron Global in the summer of 2015, but on a much larger scale in a \n \nmission critical location in downtown [NYC Location]. The pilot involved testing and treating 35 CRAC \n \nunits averaging 10-years of age using the same IPMVP methodologies as in the ﬁrst pilot.

The Circuit Master® devices treat the power supplying these same \nCRAC systems. Working together, the ECMs beneﬁt Data Center Provider/Data Center REIT in any or all of the following ways:\n \n• Restoring capacity of the CRAC systems to satisfy ﬂuctuating building loads or lower room temps\n \n• Producing additional CRAC system redundancy at no extra cost or interruption to operations \n \n• Improving CRAC system efﬁciency, lowering cost to produce each ton of cooling required \n \n• Restoring thermal efﬁciency, allowing CRAC systems to achieve thermostat set points faster, reducing \n \n   runtime and extending equipment life by 15%+ \n \n• Reducing amp draw and demand charges (KVA) while increasing Power Factor utilization\n \n• Producing cooler operating temperatures of compressors, reducing service calls \nThe improvements demonstrated in this or any ﬁeld test resulting from PermaFrost NMR® and Circuit Master® are \ndependent on factors such as age, condition, service history, runtime of one or both compressors, and the design \nand operational application of each system. The results in this pilot were very consistent with 14+ year historical \nperformance averages as well as recently successful pilots conducted at multiple Data Center Provider locations and independent \nlaboratory study completed in May, 2015 on DX equipment by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) in their testing \nchambers in [Texas Location], TX.\nSite Selection\nThe location chosen for this pilot was a separate data center suite supported by four pilot CRAC systems put into \nservice in 2001.  The conﬁguration of this suite puts the major load on CRAC systems 1, 2 and 3.  CRAC system 4 \nsupports the least densely populated area of the main ﬂoor furthest from the entrance. At the start of the pilot, \nCRAC system 4 was the only system where the second compressor was occasionally cycling on and off. A \ntemperature logger placed on top of the cable racks in the center aisle of the suite on November 11, just prior to \nthe ECM’s being installed, measured temperatures averaging 84 degrees.  \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n3", "tokens": 811, "chars": 3649, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_108_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_108_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:3ac5fe678de3dd430c061fcaf66aa991452ee61f416ef72345d4e0d01768c4f6"}

When  \n \n   initially tested, the pilot CRAC systems together were producing 91.6 tons of cooling. Following \n \n   installation, the cooling capacity jumped by 19.6 tons or 21.4% to 111.2 tons.\n \n \n• The overall cost to produce each ton of cooling on the pilot systems dropped 28.5% from 1.58 kW/ton \n \n   in the baseline to 1.13 kW/ton after installation of the two ECMs. This means for every ton of cooling \n \n   the four pilot CRAC systems are asked to produce, Data Center Provider/Data Center REIT is spending 28.5% less to do so.\n \n• The projected annual kWh’s were reduced by 370,000 or 28.5%, from 1,300,180 to 930,180.\n \n• The environmental conditions inside the data center dropped 3.8 degrees from ~84 degrees to 80.2 \n \n   degrees. With improved air movement in the hot aisles, this increase in capacity now has the potential \n \n   to enable the CRAC systems to better handle the growing heat load in the suite (and cycle occasionally). \n \n• The average kW dropped 13.9% from an average of 143.02 in the baseline to 123.11 in the post when \n \n   comparing ﬁve separate 24-hour blocks of time under similar outdoor air temperatures affecting the \n \n   condensing units. The true effect of these savings over time are further explained in the regression analysis.\n \n• The power factor was increased in the four pilot CRAC systems by 15.9% from .728 to .844. \nThe four similar CRAC cooling systems involved in the study are recorded as follows:\n \nLiebert, Mfg date: 2001, R22, Nominal 30-tons, 480 volt-3 Phase, Model VH380AUAAEI\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n4", "tokens": 794, "chars": 3267, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_108_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_108_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:9b47bd8f331b52d7efd6346fcbd4aac80f40f4e463ab8581c955c303ca5d4078"}

They included: \n \n1. Determine that the “as-is” capacity and efﬁciency of the pilot CRAC systems supporting the Data Center Provider/Data Center REIT \n \n    suite had degraded by at least 10% after 14 years in operation.  \n \n2. Demonstrate at least 12% performance improvement in tonnage and/or corresponding kW/ton and \n \n    energy reduction in the pilot CRAC cooling systems 250 hours or more after PermaFrost NMR® and the \n \n    Circuit Master devices were installed. \n \n3. Demonstrate the ability of the CRAC pilot systems to produce cooler, drier air as measured in both Dry \n \n    Bulb and Wet Bulb deltas after being treated.  \n \n4. To support an effective business case for further deployments of the ECMs within the Data Center Provider/Data Center REIT  \n    \n \n    portfolio of properties, demonstrate ﬁnancial beneﬁts associated with efﬁciency improvements \n \n    realized over the duration of the study. These beneﬁts must be equivalent to a 24-month or less \n \n    payback to Data Center Provider/Data Center REIT on their initial project costs.  \nECM Product Briefs\nPermaFrost NMR®\nPermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented surface science nanotechnology that uses \nNucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR®) technology as its core agent. A \nsustainable, one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® \nlasts for the remaining life of any type of climate control system in which it is \ninstalled. The direct beneﬁts of PermaFrost NMR® are increased capacity \nresulting in improved system efﬁciency.  \n \nCircuit Master®\nCircuit Master® is a product that blocks distortions in electrical power above \nand below the normal signal range and contains line ﬁlter capacitors to improve \npower factor. This allows induction power equipment such as HVAC, \nrefrigeration, motors and pumps to use less energy.  Equipment lifespan is also \nincreased and maintenance costs are reduced. This equipment is installed at the \nelectrical disconnect for each machine or at each compressor in a dual-circuit \nHVAC unit where both compressors run an extensive amount of time annually.\n  \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n5", "tokens": 656, "chars": 2880, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_108_chunk_0003", "next_id": "pdf_108_chunk_0005", "content_hash": "sha256:45ebc1965ced74195a174d26a83c67827bfcd4fa617383da86ed09ebe68873ce"}

First, after \nverifying the amount of air ﬂowing across the evaporator coils before beginning each pilot, the subsequent \nmeasurements used in the efﬁciency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with Option B of \nthe IPMVP (International Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol). This Protocol was developed by experts in the \ninternational community and endorsed by the US Department of Energy to provide a consistent method for \nanalyzing HVAC system performance. Baseline measurements were taken on November 11 with outside air \ntemperatures averaging between 68-70 degrees. Post measurements were then taken in the same fashion on a \nsimilar weather day on December 16. \nThe results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic \nengineering formulas:\n \n• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor * Sq Rt 3 /1000 (for 3-Phase) \n \n• kW/ton = Actual Measured Energy / Actual Measured Capacity \n \n• Coefﬁcient of Performance (COP) = 12 / (kW/ton) /3.412\n \n• Actual Cooling Capacity per Hour = (Measured CFM * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta T) / 12,000 BTU\nThe second method used to capture data involved installing a utility-grade power meter directly at the electrical \npanel housing only the breakers for the four pilot CRAC systems and the corresponding condensing units. The \nmeter was installed on November 4 to capture one week of baseline prior to the ECM’s being installed on \nNovember 11. This data was then compared to data in the post (after PermaFrost NMR® had been in the systems \nfor at least 250 runtime hours) in blocks of time when the weather was the same.  \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n6", "tokens": 527, "chars": 2353, "pages": {"start": 5, "end": 6}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_108_chunk_0004", "next_id": "pdf_108_chunk_0006", "content_hash": "sha256:85644d75bd6b5d59acd7d6a17c0b4fd41e64790ef605ce77de36d86e969addf1"}

KW/ton is commonly used for larger commercial and \nindustrial air conditioning, heat pump and refrigeration systems. It is the HVAC industry’s standard of determining \nhow much energy is required to create a single ton of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you reduce the unit \ncost of cooling you are saving energy regardless of how much overall cooling is required.\nThe chart to the right clearly illustrates the amount of \nefﬁciency restoration the ECMs created in the pilot \nsystems after treatment. The four treated pilot CRAC \nsystems are now performing 28.5% more efﬁciently than \nbefore being treated.

These results will vary slightly from the tables \nlisted earlier in this report due to rounding only to the ﬁrst decimal position for cooling ton and kW values.\nAverage Baseline Energy Consumption\nBaseline Capacity:  91.6 tons\nAdjusted kW Baseline:  1.58 kW/ton * 111.2 tons = 175.7 kW\nAdjusted Baseline kWh:  175.7 kW * 7,400 Annual Operating Hours = 1,300,180 kWh\nRevised Cost to Run Baseline: 1,300,180 kWh * $.09 = $117,016\nAverage Post Energy Consumption\nkW Post:  1.13 kW/ton * 111.2 tons = 125.7 kW\nAnnual kWh Post:  125.7 kW * 7,400 hours = 930,180 kWh\nAnnual Cost Post:  930,180 kWh * $.09 cents = $83,716\nAverage Savings Per Year Per Unit\nAvoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year:  $117,016 - $83,716 = $33,300\nEstimated Energy Savings per Month: $33,300 / 12 = $2,775\nReturn on Investment\nCost of PermaFrost NMR® and Circuit Master® devices installed in the pilot cooling systems: $29,428\nEstimated ROI for Data Center Provider/Data Center REIT when treating the pilot cooling systems: $29,428 / $2,775 = ~10.6 mos\nAdditional Savings\nIn addition to the above savings, demand was also reduced potentially providing additional cost savings.  In order \nto identify these savings, a copy of the electric bills is required to identify the cost of demand and the additional \ncost impact these energy conservation measures provided.\nAnnual Internal Rate of Return = 113%\nReturn on Investment Over 5 Years = 566%\nExplanation of Regression Analysis\nTo obtain a realistic avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Data Center Provider/Data Center REIT for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® and Circuit Master® \nECMs, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy savings resulting from the improvement in both capacity and efficiency \nutilizing data collected during the pilot study. Working together, these improvements reduce the annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis \nPeriod. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the cooling systems was when operating at the original energy profile to produce \nthe newly restored amount of available capacity before then subtracting the revised cost to run the cooling systems at the same restored capacity \nafter the ECMs were installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or \nload % at which the systems will now operate due to the restored performance profile. This restored performance profile allows will normally allow \nthe cooling systems to satisfy the internal area set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.\n14\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 755, "chars": 3349, "pages": {"start": 13, "end": 14}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_108_chunk_0009", "next_id": "pdf_108_chunk_0011", "content_hash": "sha256:5ccc9d2e2766f4dbc39e6f71c3c38a44708076100b3654c616ac5dc5c114fb34"}
