The study ran from July 14 to September 4, 2015.\n \nThe pilot was designed to illustrate the positive impact the PermaFrost NMR® energy control measure (ECM) \nwould have on the overall cooling performance of two common types of cooling units supporting the facilities. \nThe improvements for this or any ﬁeld test resulting from PermaFrost NMR® are dependent on factors such as \nage, condition, service history, design and application of each unit. In this particular pilot, the results were very \nconsistent with 13 year historical performance averages as well as the recent laboratory study completed in May \nof 2015 by Underwriters Laboratories in their testing chambers in [Texas Location], TX. \nA package rooftop unit was tested and treated at the MCVET facility. At the Non-Profit Organization, a small split system \nserving the 2nd ﬂoor common area was tested and treated. In this facility, the team also tested but did not treat an \nidentical small split system serving the 3rd ﬂoor common area. Though no two pieces of cooling equipment are \nidentical nor do they get the same amount of runtime, in this case the 3rd ﬂoor split system acted as a control unit \nof sorts.  All the units involved in the pilot were put into full service in 2000. \nHighlights of the study when comparing the pilot unit to itself before and six weeks after treatment include the \nfollowing:\n \n• When initially tested after 15 years in service, the MCVET pilot unit was producing 11.14 tons of cooling. \n \n   Six weeks after treatment, the cooling capacity jumped 30.1% to 14.6 tons. \n \n \n• The cost to produce each ton of cooling on the MCVET pilot unit dropped 19.6% from 1.07 kW/ton in \n \n   the baseline to .86 kW/ton six weeks after treatment. \n \n \n• When initially tested after 15 years in service, the Non-Profit Organization pilot unit was producing 2.59 tons of \n \n   cooling. Six weeks after treatment, the cooling capacity jumped 27.6% to 3.31 tons. \n \n \n• The cost to produce each ton of cooling on the Non-Profit Organization pilot unit dropped 35% from 1.17 kW/ton \n \n   in the baseline to .76 kW/ton six weeks after treatment.", "tokens": 769, "chars": 3327, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_074_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:1e6ded5cd10892bcd7e302bb16b34badf45bfc8f98db5f7f8f8814856525e029"}

It is the HVAC industry’s standard of determining \nhow much energy is required to create 1 ton of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you reduce your unit cost of \ncooling you are saving energy regardless of how much overall cooling you require.\nLike everyone in the world, Baltimore City has the \nproblem of thermal degradation in their HVAC units. The \ndegraded equipment performance is costing the \nBaltimore City and their tenants’ signiﬁcant operational \ndollars through wasted energy. When initially tested \nbefore being treated, the pilot cooling units were found \nto already be using signiﬁcantly more energy to operate \nafter 15 years in service than when they were new.

Working \ntogether, these improvements reduce the annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from \ndetermining what the cost to run the cooling unit was when operating at the original energy proﬁle to produce \nthe newly restored amount of available capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the cooling unit at \nthe same restored capacity after the PermaFrostNMR® ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the most \nwidely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or load % at which the unit will now \noperate due to the restored performance proﬁle. This restored performance proﬁle allows the cooling unit to \nsatisfy the internal area set point with increased efﬁciency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.\n10\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 745, "chars": 3017, "pages": {"start": 9, "end": 10}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_074_chunk_0006", "next_id": "pdf_074_chunk_0008", "content_hash": "sha256:8887f78e2072acdfba4f084cec207741ddeaf0e39cc15b044047601426f2eca9"}

Working \ntogether, these improvements reduce the annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from \ndetermining what the cost to run the cooling unit was when operating at the original energy proﬁle to produce \nthe newly restored amount of available capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the cooling unit at \nthe same restored capacity after the PermaFrostNMR® ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the most \nwidely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or load % at which the unit will now \noperate due to the restored performance proﬁle. This restored performance proﬁle allows the cooling unit to \nsatisfy the internal area set point with increased efﬁciency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.\n11\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\n!\n12\nPassenger vehicles\nGarbage trucks of waste recycled\ninstead of landﬁlled\nGallons of gasoline\nconsumed\nPounds of coal burned\nannually\nBarrels of oil\nconsumed\nHomes’ electricity use for\none year\nBaltimore City is Saving More than Just Energy\nBy treating just the pilot cooling units with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the manner in which they are currently \nbeing operated, Baltimore City will save approximately 14,465 kWh per year and all the costs associated with \nthose savings. From an environmental impact standpoint, Baltimore City will also beneﬁt all the surrounding \ncommunities in which they operate.  Imagine the positive environmental impacts of treating the rest of Baltimore \nCity facilities.\nThe 14,465 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 10 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from being \nreleased or any of the following:  \nAnnual greenhouse emissions from:\nCO2 emissions from:\n2.1\n.511\n1,122\n10,714\n23.2\n1.4\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\n!\n13\nCertiﬁcation\n[Engineering Consultant], P.E., for EET reviewed the testing and data collection methodology used in this pilot and \nattests to the integrity and accuracy of the data pre and post PermaFrost NMR® treatment.\nPlace P.E.
