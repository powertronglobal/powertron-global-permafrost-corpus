Baltimore City is Saving More than Just Energy
By treating just the pilot cooling units with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the manner in which they are currently 
being operated, Baltimore City will save approximately 14,465 kWh per year and all the costs associated with 
those savings. From an environmental impact standpoint, Baltimore City will also beneﬁt all the surrounding 
communities in which they operate.  Imagine the positive environmental impacts of treating the rest of Baltimore 
City facilities.
The 14,465 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 10 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from being 
released or any of the following:
