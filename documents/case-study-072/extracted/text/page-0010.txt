Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following is the ﬁnal calculated performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® Post 
measurement period for each of the two treated pilot units.  
MCVET Pilot Unit
Baseline Energy Consumption
Avg. Baseline Capacity:  11.14 tons
Avg. Adjusted kW Baseline:  1.07 kw/ton * 14.60 tons = 15.62 kW
Avg. Adjusted Baseline kWh:  15.62 kW * 3,280 Annual Operating Hrs = 51,234 kWh
Avg. Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 51,234 kWh * $.105 = $5,380
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post:  0.86 kW/ton * 14.60 tons = 12.56 kW
Annual kWh Post:  12.56 kW * 3,280 hours = 41,197 kWh
Annual Cost Post:  41,197 kWh * $.105 cents = $4,326
Savings per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year:  $5,380 - $4,326 = $1,054
Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $1,054 / 12 = $88
Return on Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the MCVET pilot cooling unit: $1,250
Estimated ROI Period for Baltimore City on MCVET pilot cooling unit: $1,250 / $88 = ~14.2 Months
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 84%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 422%
Regression Analysis Notes
Utilizing data collected during the pilot study, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback 
period for Baltimore City for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to 
calculate the true energy savings resulting from the improvement in both capacity and efﬁciency. Working 
together, these improvements reduce the annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from 
determining what the cost to run the cooling unit was when operating at the original energy proﬁle to produce 
the newly restored amount of available capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the cooling unit at 
the same restored capacity after the PermaFrostNMR® ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the most 
widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or load % at which the unit will now 
operate due to the restored performance proﬁle. This restored performance proﬁle allows the cooling unit to 
satisfy the internal area set point with increased efﬁciency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
