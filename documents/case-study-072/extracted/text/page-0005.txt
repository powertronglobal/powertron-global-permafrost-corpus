The chart to the left illustrates the efﬁciency restoration the ECM created in the Non-Profit Organization pilot unit six weeks 
after treatment. And ﬁnally, the chart to the right illustrates the efﬁciency restoration the ECM has produced in the 
15-year old Non-Profit Organization treated pilot unit versus a very similar control unit that has yet to be treated. The 
obvious degradation in operational efﬁciency is costing Baltimore City and their tenants a substantial amount of 
money in wasted energy.  As the last chart clearly illustrates, the treated pilot unit is currently performing 26.9% 
more efﬁciently than the untreated control unit. This gap will only continue to widen until it levels off at 30-35% 
loss of efﬁciency.
