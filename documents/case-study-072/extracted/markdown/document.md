Purpose of the Study

This report details the results of the recently completed comprehensive energy performance study conducted at

two Baltimore City sponsored locations: The Maryland Center for Veterans Education & Training (MCVET) and The

Non-Profit Organization.  The study ran from July 14 to September 4, 2015.

The pilot was designed to illustrate the positive impact the PermaFrost NMR® energy control measure (ECM)

would have on the overall cooling performance of two common types of cooling units supporting the facilities.

The improvements for this or any ﬁeld test resulting from PermaFrost NMR® are dependent on factors such as

age, condition, service history, design and application of each unit. In this particular pilot, the results were very

consistent with 13 year historical performance averages as well as the recent laboratory study completed in May

of 2015 by Underwriters Laboratories in their testing chambers in [Texas Location], TX.

A package rooftop unit was tested and treated at the MCVET facility. At the Non-Profit Organization, a small split system

serving the 2nd ﬂoor common area was tested and treated. In this facility, the team also tested but did not treat an

identical small split system serving the 3rd ﬂoor common area. Though no two pieces of cooling equipment are

identical nor do they get the same amount of runtime, in this case the 3rd ﬂoor split system acted as a control unit

of sorts.  All the units involved in the pilot were put into full service in 2000.

Highlights of the study when comparing the pilot unit to itself before and six weeks after treatment include the

following:

• When initially tested after 15 years in service, the MCVET pilot unit was producing 11.14 tons of cooling.

Six weeks after treatment, the cooling capacity jumped 30.1% to 14.6 tons.

• The cost to produce each ton of cooling on the MCVET pilot unit dropped 19.6% from 1.07 kW/ton in

the baseline to .86 kW/ton six weeks after treatment.

• When initially tested after 15 years in service, the Non-Profit Organization pilot unit was producing 2.59 tons of

cooling. Six weeks after treatment, the cooling capacity jumped 27.6% to 3.31 tons.

• The cost to produce each ton of cooling on the Non-Profit Organization pilot unit dropped 35% from 1.17 kW/ton

in the baseline to .76 kW/ton six weeks after treatment.

• When comparing the Non-Profit Organization treated pilot unit to the identical untreated control unit, the pilot

unit is now producing 3.31 tons of cooling at just .76 kW per ton. By comparison, the control unit is

producing 2.84 tons at 1.04 kW/ton. These numbers represent an increase in tonnage of .47 tons or

16.5% while the cost to produce each ton of cooling is 26.9% less expensive in the pilot unit.

• The initial payback period for treating the MCVET pilot unit equates to 14.2 months while the initial

payback period for treating the Non-Profit Organization pilot unit is just 9.6 months.

• The annual combined cost to operate the two pilot units prior to treatment with PermaFrost NMR® was

estimated to be $6,713. Six weeks following treatment the cost to operate the units fell to $5,194.

Objectives

The four key objectives for this jointly-conducted ECM pilot study between Baltimore City, Powertron Global

Engineering team and EnergyEfﬁcient Technologies were all achieved.  They included:

1. Determine that the “as-is” capacity and efﬁciency of the pilot units unit supporting the MCVET and

Non-Profit Organization facilities had degraded by at least 10% after 15 years in operation.

2. Demonstrate that a minimum of 10% performance improvement occurred in each of the pilot cooling

units six weeks after being treated with the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.

3. After 15 years in service, demonstrate the effectiveness and sustainability of the ECM by increasing the

“as-is” efﬁciency and capacity of the treated pilot units by more than 10% when compared to an

identical untreated control unit performing the same function on another ﬂoor.

4. To support an effective business case for further deployments of the ECM within the Baltimore City

portfolio of properties, demonstrate ﬁnancial beneﬁts associated with efﬁciency improvements

realized over the duration of the study. These beneﬁts must be equivalent to a 24-month or less

payback to Baltimore City on their initial project costs.

ECM Product Brief

PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented surface science nanotechnology that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative

(NMR®) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost

NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type of climate control system in which it is installed.  The direct beneﬁts

of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling efﬁciency and increased capacity, both of which result in lower overall

costs to operate a system and extended equipment life.

Methodology

After verifying the amount of air ﬂowing across the evaporator coil before beginning the pilot, the subsequent

measurements used in the efﬁciency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with Option B of

the IPMVP (International Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol) framework.

The results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic

engineering formulas:

• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase)

• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of .85/1000 (for 1-Phase)

• kW/ton = Actual Measured Energy / Actual Measured Capacity

• Coefﬁcient of Performance (COP) = 12 / (kW/ton) /3.412

• Actual Cooling Capacity per Hour = (Measured CFM * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta T) / 12,000 BTU

Recovered Unit Cost with PermaFrost NMR® ECM

The “Unit Cost” in the HVAC industry is the kw/ton ratio. kW/ton is commonly used for larger commercial and

industrial air-conditioning, heat pump and refrigeration systems. It is the HVAC industry’s standard of determining

how much energy is required to create 1 ton of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you reduce your unit cost of

cooling you are saving energy regardless of how much overall cooling you require.

Like everyone in the world, Baltimore City has the

problem of thermal degradation in their HVAC units. The

degraded equipment performance is costing the

Baltimore City and their tenants’ signiﬁcant operational

dollars through wasted energy. When initially tested

before being treated, the pilot cooling units were found

to already be using signiﬁcantly more energy to operate

after 15 years in service than when they were new. The

same thing is true for the untreated control cooling unit

after 15 years in service.

The chart to the right illustrates the amount of efﬁciency

restoration the ECM created in the MCVET pilot unit six

weeks after treatment.

The chart to the left illustrates the efﬁciency restoration the ECM created in the Non-Profit Organization pilot unit six weeks

after treatment. And ﬁnally, the chart to the right illustrates the efﬁciency restoration the ECM has produced in the

15-year old Non-Profit Organization treated pilot unit versus a very similar control unit that has yet to be treated. The

obvious degradation in operational efﬁciency is costing Baltimore City and their tenants a substantial amount of

money in wasted energy.  As the last chart clearly illustrates, the treated pilot unit is currently performing 26.9%

more efﬁciently than the untreated control unit. This gap will only continue to widen until it levels off at 30-35%

loss of efﬁciency.

Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics

The following is the ﬁnal calculated performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® Post

measurement period for each of the two treated pilot units.

MCVET Pilot Unit

Baseline Energy Consumption

Avg. Baseline Capacity:  11.14 tons

Avg. Adjusted kW Baseline:  1.07 kw/ton * 14.60 tons = 15.62 kW

Avg. Adjusted Baseline kWh:  15.62 kW * 3,280 Annual Operating Hrs = 51,234 kWh

Avg. Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 51,234 kWh * $.105 = $5,380

Post Energy Consumption

kW Post:  0.86 kW/ton * 14.60 tons = 12.56 kW

Annual kWh Post:  12.56 kW * 3,280 hours = 41,197 kWh

Annual Cost Post:  41,197 kWh * $.105 cents = $4,326

Savings per Year

Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year:  $5,380 - $4,326 = $1,054

Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $1,054 / 12 = $88

Return on Investment

Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the MCVET pilot cooling unit: $1,250

Estimated ROI Period for Baltimore City on MCVET pilot cooling unit: $1,250 / $88 = ~14.2 Months

Annual Internal Rate of Return = 84%

Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 422%

Regression Analysis Notes

Utilizing data collected during the pilot study, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback

period for Baltimore City for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to

calculate the true energy savings resulting from the improvement in both capacity and efﬁciency. Working

together, these improvements reduce the annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from

determining what the cost to run the cooling unit was when operating at the original energy proﬁle to produce

the newly restored amount of available capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the cooling unit at

the same restored capacity after the PermaFrostNMR® ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the most

widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or load % at which the unit will now

operate due to the restored performance proﬁle. This restored performance proﬁle allows the cooling unit to

satisfy the internal area set point with increased efﬁciency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.

Avg. Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 12,694 kWh * $.105 = $1,333

Post Energy Consumption

kW Post:  0.76 kW * 3.31 tons = 2.52 kW

Annual kWh Post:  2.52 kW * 3,280 hours = 8,266 kWh

Baltimore City is Saving More than Just Energy

By treating just the pilot cooling units with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the manner in which they are currently

being operated, Baltimore City will save approximately 14,465 kWh per year and all the costs associated with

those savings. From an environmental impact standpoint, Baltimore City will also beneﬁt all the surrounding

communities in which they operate.  Imagine the positive environmental impacts of treating the rest of Baltimore

City facilities.

The 14,465 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 10 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from being

released or any of the following:
