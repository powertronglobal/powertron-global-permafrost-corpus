The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for all five of the Major Restaurant Chain Systems tested.
Baseline Energy Consumption without PermaFrost NMR®
Baseline Tonnage: 18.52 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: 2.61 kW/ton * 23.34 tons = 60.92 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 60.92 kW * 2,578 Annual Operating Hrs = 157,052 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 157,052 kWh * $.11 = $17,276
Post Energy Consumption with PermaFrost NMR®
kW Post: 2.06 kW/ton * 23.34 tons = 48.08 kW
Annual kWh Post: 48.08 kW * 2,578 hours = 123,950 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 123,950 kWh * .11 cents = $13,635
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $17,276 - $13,635 = $3,641
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $3,641 / 12 = $303
Return On Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in all five of the pilot systems: $3,025
Estimated ROI Period for all five Pilot units: $3,025 / $303 = 10 months
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period 
for Major Restaurant Chain for implementing the PermaFrost NMR®, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true 
energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended 
in the Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems was when operating at the 
original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the 
revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® was installed. This regression 
analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the systems will now operate 
due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the internal building set points with 
increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
