HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Calculated Eﬃciency of Major Restaurant Chain Cooling Systems Baseline and Post
The chart below illustrates how far off design the Major Restaurant Chain pilot systems had degraded in terms of efficiency 
over an average of 11 years of the coils being in use. 
The two RTU’s were performing at an average of 78.3% of the original design efficiency when they were first 
installed and the Refrigeration systems at 73.2%. The nominal design rated tonnage of each of RTU’s is 10 tons 
and the Refrigeration systems average 1.3 tons. In actuality however, each of the RTU’s was only producing an 
average of 7.82 tons at the start of the pilot and the Refrigeration systems just .953 tons. The majority of the 
21.7% efficiency loss in the RTU’s and the 26.8% efficiency loss in the Refrigeration systems is directly 
attributable to the thermal degradation of the heat exchange surfaces. This is due in large part to thermal degradation 
creating an insulating barrier to heat transfer through the tube walls. 
After the ECM was installed, the average efficiency in the RTU’s unit jumped up to 98% of design specifications 
or 9.8 tons each and the Refrigeration systems jumped up to 95.7% or 1.25 tons. This represents a 25.3% 
improvement in efficiency over the baseline RTU numbers and a 31.2% improvement in efficiency over the 
baseline Refrigeration numbers.
