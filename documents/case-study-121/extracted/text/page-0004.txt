Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the pilot systems to perform prior to and 
following the PermaFrost NMR® (ECM) being installed. The report also illustrates the amount of thermal 
degradation that had already occurred within the heat exchangers, due in large part to thermal degradation and how 
much of that has been restored.
 
The following report lists the results of using the IPMVP as the M&V plan. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• Tons (RTU) = (Airflow * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta) / 12,000 
 
• Tons (Refrigeration) = (Airflow * 1.08 * Temp Δ) / 12,000
 
• KW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
 
• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Air Temp – Saturated Suction Temp 
 
• Temperature Delta = DB Entering Air Temp – DB Supply Air Temp
Notes 
Following a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to determine the operational condition of the systems was still 
satisfactory; ECM data was collected and recorded by the M&V team in both the baseline and post reporting periods. All 
data collected was witnessed by Wen-North technicians. The deltas of these measurements demonstrate the amount of 
capacity restored and amount of money saved.
The following IPMVP data points were recorded on 7 March 2014 and 8 May 2014 using recently purchased devices 
calibrated in accordance with NIST (National Institutes of Standards and Technology) standards to insure measurement 
accuracy. 
All measurements were taken at 100% load and at similar return air and outdoor air temperatures. 
The collection of the data in both periods was collected by Powertron Global® and visual evidence of all measurements 
used in the calculations in this report are available upon request. The detailed measurements are listed further below.
