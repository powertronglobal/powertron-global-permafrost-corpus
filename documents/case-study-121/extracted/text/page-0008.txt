Cost to Major Restaurant Chain to Operate the RTU’s, WIC’s & WIF Baseline vs Post
The next chart illustrates how much money the efficiency performance loss in the pilot systems was costing 
Major Restaurant Chain in the way of wasted energy each and every day they were operating prior to the ECM. The average 
cost to operate the RTU’s as calculated in kW/ ton was 1.44 in the Baseline and the Refrigeration systems 
averaged 3.4. When new, the kW/ton rating for RTU’s like these usually ranges from 1.0 to 1.2 kW/ton and the 
Refrigeration systems range from 2.3 to 2.5. This means the Major Restaurant Chain franchisee was paying up to 30.9% more 
than design for the energy to run the RTU’s, and up to 29.4% more to run the Refrigeration systems as a direct 
result of the baseline reduced level of performance. These kW/ton ratings are very much in line with the 
ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers.
  
The restored average kW/ton rating for the RTU’s following the ECM is now 1.12 and 2.68 kW/ton in the 
Refrigeration systems. This represents a 22.2% reduction in energy costs for the RTU’s and a 21.2% reduction 
for the Refrigeration systems from the baseline for every ton of cooling produced. An added benefit to Major Restaurant Chain 
is the reduced cost to operate all of the systems combined to near original design specifications.
The $3,641 in annual energy savings generated during the pilot have resulted in a payback period to Major Restaurant Chain 
of approximately 10 months. Over just a few years these accumulated savings will greatly reduce the eventual 
CapEx costs to replace the systems when they finally reach the end of their useful life.
