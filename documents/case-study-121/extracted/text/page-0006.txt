Recovered Wasted Energy with PermaFrost NMR®
RTU’s, WIC’s & WIF
The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration the ECM created in the treated systems. 
The average cost to operate these systems before they 
were treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, totaled 2.61.
The total cost to operate these systems after they were 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, is currently 2.06.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate for these 11 year old systems. The post results are also 
in line with the average improvement savings shown in more than 120,000 installations globally.
