Power Bill Validation of Eﬃciency Study Results
Of primary importance to every business owner who implements an ECM is the ultimate impact it has on 
lowering the power bills, given all things being equal. Unfortunately power bills are not nearly as scientific a 
methodology to determine energy savings as business owners would like to think. It is why the power 
companies don’t issue rebates based on power bills. The variables are many and controlling them is hard. One 
commonly accepted way to view year-over-year savings resulting from an ECM (if in fact nothing inside the 
store has changed) is to look at kWh usage in like periods and then normalize for weather through the use of 
cooling degree days (CDD’s). 
In the Major Restaurant Chain pilot, this is a bit more complicated because not all of the cooling system equipment in each 
store was treated. Given that nothing else in the store has changed, confidence is high that any and all kWh 
savings achieved in the first month after the ECM is directly attributable to PermaFrost NMR®. 
The total cooling system load at the time of the pilot is estimated to be 55% of the total power bill. The cooling 
system load averaged throughout the year however is estimated to be 40%. The cooling systems treated 
represent approximately 50-60% of the total cooling systems supporting the store.
KWh Savings Attributable to PermaFrost NMR® 
*Orlando: Given 2014 was 18.5% warmer than the corresponding period in 2013 and the cooling systems represent 40% of the overall power bill throughout 
the year, the kWh for 2014 was reduced by 7.4%.
*Tamarac: Given 2014 was 25.9% warmer than the corresponding period in 2013 and the cooling systems represent 40% of the overall power bill throughout 
the year, the kWh for 2014 was reduced by 10.4%.
