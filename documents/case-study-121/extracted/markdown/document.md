HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report

Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study

The purpose of this study is to verify how effective the PermaFrost NMR® Energy Conservation Measure

(ECM) is in real world situations on average-aged cooling systems common to Major Restaurant Chain Restaurants across the

country. Two locations were chosen in Florida for the study, but the ECM works the same way in all cooling

systems common to the food service industry, producing energy savings by reversing the efficiency robbing

effects of thermal degradation. This same efficiency improvement is then quantified into dollars saved by

Major Restaurant Chain in the treated systems.

The roof top units (RTU’s), Walk-in Coolers (WIC’s) and Walk-in Freezer (WIF) involved in this study are

representative of a great majority of the portfolio of equipment operated by Major Restaurant Chain franchisees across the U.S.

and overseas. To better illustrate the substantial impact of the savings, the same information gathered in the

study is then extrapolated out across large numbers of Major Restaurant Chain restaurants to closely estimate what has already

been lost in term of energy costs. This same extrapolation methodology is also used to estimate what the potential

future avoided wasted energy costs are expected to be when treating all RTU’s, refrigeration and ice machines.

Many industry leading organizations including the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air

Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), project that all heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration

(HVACR) units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they operate and age. Thermal degradation is caused by a

phenomenon that is present in all HVACR equipment that operates as a vapor compression cycle associated

with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well documented by the HVACR industry

and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal degradation prevents units from operating at the

original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times and additional kWh consumption.

Process

This report contains specific information regarding the baseline and post ECM performance profile of two similar

RTU’s, two similar WIC’s and one WIF.

Detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the pilot systems to determine the

impact on the three key elements as they relate to the original design specifications. These same three elements

will ultimately have a positive effect on the Major Restaurant Chain franchisee’s power bill. They include:

1. The cooling capacity the systems are capable of producing after an average of 11 years in service.

2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the systems are delivering as

reflected in the kW/ton measurement.

3. The thermal dynamic ability of the systems to continue to perform at or close to operational design.

Methodology

The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the

IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted of [CEO],

CEO of Energy Consulting Partner; Wen-North VP of Operations, [VP Operations]; [Maintenance Tech], Service technician;

[Franchise Operator], Franchise Operator, and Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer].

Notes

Even though only some of the cooling systems at each location were treated

with PermaFrost NMR®, the first full monthly power bills from each

restaurant work to support the much more scientific findings. This helps to

closely estimate the amount of savings already achieved by Major Restaurant Chain and helps

determine the impact of future savings.

All RTU’s, WIC’s and the WIF were tested in sunny conditions with outside

air temperatures between 84 - 86 degrees.

The boundary of the testing was the RTU’s, WIC’s and the WIF and nothing

else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance calculations is very

high.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)

The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the pilot systems to perform prior to and

following the PermaFrost NMR® (ECM) being installed. The report also illustrates the amount of thermal

degradation that had already occurred within the heat exchangers, due in large part to thermal degradation and how

much of that has been restored.

The following report lists the results of using the IPMVP as the M&V plan.

The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:

• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase)

• Tons (RTU) = (Airflow * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta) / 12,000

• Tons (Refrigeration) = (Airflow * 1.08 * Temp Δ) / 12,000

• KW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage

• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)

• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Air Temp – Saturated Suction Temp

• Temperature Delta = DB Entering Air Temp – DB Supply Air Temp

Notes

Following a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to determine the operational condition of the systems was still

satisfactory; ECM data was collected and recorded by the M&V team in both the baseline and post reporting periods. All

data collected was witnessed by Wen-North technicians. The deltas of these measurements demonstrate the amount of

capacity restored and amount of money saved.

The following IPMVP data points were recorded on 7 March 2014 and 8 May 2014 using recently purchased devices

calibrated in accordance with NIST (National Institutes of Standards and Technology) standards to insure measurement

accuracy.

All measurements were taken at 100% load and at similar return air and outdoor air temperatures.

The collection of the data in both periods was collected by Powertron Global® and visual evidence of all measurements

used in the calculations in this report are available upon request. The detailed measurements are listed further below.

Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results

Combined Cooling System Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM

Major Restaurant Chain is experiencing significant thermal degradation in their HVAC/R systems. The lower baseline

operating tonnage and COP ratings are calculated based on historical data and are in line with the ASHRAE

loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. The degraded performance in the five pilot systems was

costing the Major Restaurant Chain franchisee, Wen-North, significant money in wasted energy. On average, the systems were

using significantly more kWh to operate than they were when they were new.

The performance summary includes the average measured efficiency and tonnage across all the systems in the

baseline and post testing periods, demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. Each individual system is

also broken out.

The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM in the five systems averaging 11 years of age resulted in a

restoration of 4.82 operating tons, equating to an increase of 26% over the baseline. The systems also showed

and an average improvement of 30.2% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to

operate the systems throughout the year and resulting in an initial ECM project payback period conservatively

estimated at 10 months.

The chart to the right illustrates the performance

restoration the ECM created in the treated systems.

The average cost to operate these systems before they

were treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in

kW/ton, totaled 2.61.

The total cost to operate these systems after they were

treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in

kW/ton, is currently 2.06.

The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of

performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate for these 11 year old systems. The post results are also

in line with the average improvement savings shown in more than 120,000 installations globally.

HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Calculated Eﬃciency of Major Restaurant Chain Cooling Systems Baseline and Post

The chart below illustrates how far off design the Major Restaurant Chain pilot systems had degraded in terms of efficiency

over an average of 11 years of the coils being in use.

The two RTU’s were performing at an average of 78.3% of the original design efficiency when they were first

installed and the Refrigeration systems at 73.2%. The nominal design rated tonnage of each of RTU’s is 10 tons

and the Refrigeration systems average 1.3 tons. In actuality however, each of the RTU’s was only producing an

average of 7.82 tons at the start of the pilot and the Refrigeration systems just .953 tons. The majority of the

21.7% efficiency loss in the RTU’s and the 26.8% efficiency loss in the Refrigeration systems is directly

attributable to the thermal degradation of the heat exchange surfaces. This is due in large part to thermal degradation

creating an insulating barrier to heat transfer through the tube walls.

After the ECM was installed, the average efficiency in the RTU’s unit jumped up to 98% of design specifications

or 9.8 tons each and the Refrigeration systems jumped up to 95.7% or 1.25 tons. This represents a 25.3%

improvement in efficiency over the baseline RTU numbers and a 31.2% improvement in efficiency over the

baseline Refrigeration numbers.

HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Cost to Major Restaurant Chain to Operate the RTU’s, WIC’s & WIF Baseline vs Post

The next chart illustrates how much money the efficiency performance loss in the pilot systems was costing

Major Restaurant Chain in the way of wasted energy each and every day they were operating prior to the ECM. The average

cost to operate the RTU’s as calculated in kW/ ton was 1.44 in the Baseline and the Refrigeration systems

averaged 3.4. When new, the kW/ton rating for RTU’s like these usually ranges from 1.0 to 1.2 kW/ton and the

Refrigeration systems range from 2.3 to 2.5. This means the Major Restaurant Chain franchisee was paying up to 30.9% more

than design for the energy to run the RTU’s, and up to 29.4% more to run the Refrigeration systems as a direct

result of the baseline reduced level of performance. These kW/ton ratings are very much in line with the

ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers.

The restored average kW/ton rating for the RTU’s following the ECM is now 1.12 and 2.68 kW/ton in the

Refrigeration systems. This represents a 22.2% reduction in energy costs for the RTU’s and a 21.2% reduction

for the Refrigeration systems from the baseline for every ton of cooling produced. An added benefit to Major Restaurant Chain

is the reduced cost to operate all of the systems combined to near original design specifications.

The $3,641 in annual energy savings generated during the pilot have resulted in a payback period to Major Restaurant Chain

of approximately 10 months. Over just a few years these accumulated savings will greatly reduce the eventual

CapEx costs to replace the systems when they finally reach the end of their useful life.

Return On Investment

The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR®

Post measurement period for all five of the Major Restaurant Chain Systems tested.

Baseline Energy Consumption without PermaFrost NMR®

Baseline Tonnage: 18.52 tons

Adjusted kW Baseline: 2.61 kW/ton * 23.34 tons = 60.92 kW

Adjusted Baseline kWh: 60.92 kW * 2,578 Annual Operating Hrs = 157,052 kWh

Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 157,052 kWh * $.11 = $17,276

Post Energy Consumption with PermaFrost NMR®

kW Post: 2.06 kW/ton * 23.34 tons = 48.08 kW

Annual kWh Post: 48.08 kW * 2,578 hours = 123,950 kWh

Annual Cost Post: 123,950 kWh * .11 cents = $13,635

Savings Per Year

Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $17,276 - $13,635 = $3,641

Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $3,641 / 12 = $303

Return On Investment

Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in all five of the pilot systems: $3,025

Estimated ROI Period for all five Pilot units: $3,025 / $303 = 10 months

Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period

for Major Restaurant Chain for implementing the PermaFrost NMR®, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true

energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended

in the Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems was when operating at the

original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the

revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® was installed. This regression

analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the systems will now operate

due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the internal building set points with

increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.

Estimated Savings to Major Restaurant Chain Franchisee for
Treating 50-Store Portfolio

The 10-month ROI achieved during the pilot is slightly FASTER than the average 12-month ROI PermaFrost 
NMR® clients normally realize in similar aged systems. The chart below illustrates the substantial savings 
potential a Major Restaurant Chain franchisee will realize by moving forward this summer with treating their portfolio of 
HVACR equipment. The following assumptions were used in the calculations:
 
• 10 year average age of HVACR equipment; 
 
• 20 tons of RTU’s and 5 tons of Refrigeration per location; 
 
• Combined cooling system annual runtime of 3500 hours each; 
 
• Average cost of $.11 per kWh delivered across all 50 restaurants

Kilowatt Hours (kWh) Loss / Gain With / Without PermaFrost NMR® Treatment

Savings indicated inside red circle equates to a 12 Month Project Payback for Major Restaurant Chain when treating all 50

locations across the US. This is determined by dividing the $151,250 cost of treating the HVACR systems

with PermaFrost NMR® by the anticipated annual savings of $152,807 and then multiplying the result by 12

months.

Savings indicated inside orange circle equates to an overall ROI for Major Restaurant Chain of 1,095% over the remaining

10 years of projected useful system life across the 50-store portfolio. This is determined by dividing the

projected 10 years of avoided cost savings of $1,656,617 by the $151,250 cost of treating the portfolio with

PermaFrost NMR® and then multiplying the result by 100.

Power Bill Validation of Eﬃciency Study Results

Of primary importance to every business owner who implements an ECM is the ultimate impact it has on

lowering the power bills, given all things being equal. Unfortunately power bills are not nearly as scientific a

methodology to determine energy savings as business owners would like to think. It is why the power

companies don’t issue rebates based on power bills. The variables are many and controlling them is hard. One

commonly accepted way to view year-over-year savings resulting from an ECM (if in fact nothing inside the

store has changed) is to look at kWh usage in like periods and then normalize for weather through the use of

cooling degree days (CDD’s).

In the Major Restaurant Chain pilot, this is a bit more complicated because not all of the cooling system equipment in each

store was treated. Given that nothing else in the store has changed, confidence is high that any and all kWh

savings achieved in the first month after the ECM is directly attributable to PermaFrost NMR®.

The total cooling system load at the time of the pilot is estimated to be 55% of the total power bill. The cooling

system load averaged throughout the year however is estimated to be 40%. The cooling systems treated

represent approximately 50-60% of the total cooling systems supporting the store.

KWh Savings Attributable to PermaFrost NMR®

*Orlando: Given 2014 was 18.5% warmer than the corresponding period in 2013 and the cooling systems represent 40% of the overall power bill throughout 
the year, the kWh for 2014 was reduced by 7.4%.

*Tamarac: Given 2014 was 25.9% warmer than the corresponding period in 2013 and the cooling systems represent 40% of the overall power bill throughout 
the year, the kWh for 2014 was reduced by 10.4%.

Major Restaurant Chain is Saving More than Just Energy

By treating a 50-store portfolio with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the manner in which the pilot systems are

currently being operated, Major Restaurant Chain will save approximately 1,389,155 kWh per year across and all the costs

associated with those savings. From an environmental impact standpoint, Major Restaurant Chain is also benefitting the

surrounding communities in which they operate.  Imagine how great the environmental impact will be when

Major Restaurant Chain franchisee’s move forward with treating all their climate control systems across the USA.

The 1,655,100 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 1,141 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from

being released or any of the following:
