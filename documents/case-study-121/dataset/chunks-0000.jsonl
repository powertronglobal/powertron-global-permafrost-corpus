Two locations were chosen in Florida for the study, but the ECM works the same way in all cooling \nsystems common to the food service industry, producing energy savings by reversing the efficiency robbing \neffects of thermal degradation. This same efficiency improvement is then quantified into dollars saved by \nMajor Restaurant Chain in the treated systems. \nThe roof top units (RTU’s), Walk-in Coolers (WIC’s) and Walk-in Freezer (WIF) involved in this study are \nrepresentative of a great majority of the portfolio of equipment operated by Major Restaurant Chain franchisees across the U.S. \nand overseas. To better illustrate the substantial impact of the savings, the same information gathered in the \nstudy is then extrapolated out across large numbers of Major Restaurant Chain restaurants to closely estimate what has already \nbeen lost in term of energy costs. This same extrapolation methodology is also used to estimate what the potential \nfuture avoided wasted energy costs are expected to be when treating all RTU’s, refrigeration and ice machines.  \nMany industry leading organizations including the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air \nConditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), project that all heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration \n(HVACR) units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they operate and age. Thermal degradation is caused by a \nphenomenon that is present in all HVACR equipment that operates as a vapor compression cycle associated \nwith refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well documented by the HVACR industry \nand the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal degradation prevents units from operating at the \noriginal design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times and additional kWh consumption.\n    1\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 716, "chars": 3430, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_117_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:3aefdb2370369af9524692e24018487e10c9ea4b32ad2b449bf1f517bf429fd5"}

These same three elements \nwill ultimately have a positive effect on the Major Restaurant Chain franchisee’s power bill. They include:\n \n \n1. The cooling capacity the systems are capable of producing after an average of 11 years in service.\n \n2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the systems are delivering as \n \n    reflected in the kW/ton measurement. \n \n3. The thermal dynamic ability of the systems to continue to perform at or close to operational design.\nMethodology\nThe measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the \nIPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted of [CEO], \nCEO of Energy Consulting Partner; Wen-North VP of Operations, [VP Operations]; [Maintenance Tech], Service technician; \n[Franchise Operator], Franchise Operator, and Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer]. \nNotes \nEven though only some of the cooling systems at each location were treated \nwith PermaFrost NMR®, the first full monthly power bills from each \nrestaurant work to support the much more scientific findings. This helps to \nclosely estimate the amount of savings already achieved by Major Restaurant Chain and helps \ndetermine the impact of future savings.  \nAll RTU’s, WIC’s and the WIF were tested in sunny conditions with outside \nair temperatures between 84 - 86 degrees.\nThe boundary of the testing was the RTU’s, WIC’s and the WIF and nothing \nelse; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance calculations is very \nhigh.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 543, "chars": 2633, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_117_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_117_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:3fd256b24ca17196ba1e13050f894b9029b2e5b38740746caf35b7844b18da70"}

The lower baseline \noperating tonnage and COP ratings are calculated based on historical data and are in line with the ASHRAE \nloss of performance and cost to operate numbers. The degraded performance in the five pilot systems was \ncosting the Major Restaurant Chain franchisee, Wen-North, significant money in wasted energy. On average, the systems were \nusing significantly more kWh to operate than they were when they were new. \nThe performance summary includes the average measured efficiency and tonnage across all the systems in the \nbaseline and post testing periods, demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. Each individual system is \nalso broken out.\nThe implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM in the five systems averaging 11 years of age resulted in a \nrestoration of 4.82 operating tons, equating to an increase of 26% over the baseline. The systems also showed \nand an average improvement of 30.2% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to \noperate the systems throughout the year and resulting in an initial ECM project payback period conservatively \nestimated at 10 months.\n2.2\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 656, "chars": 2685, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_117_chunk_0003", "next_id": "pdf_117_chunk_0005", "content_hash": "sha256:dae4b4adb5a034c10f56496465ff516f10e6e13063457d318ed6fafa4cbeebef"}

The nominal design rated tonnage of each of RTU’s is 10 tons \nand the Refrigeration systems average 1.3 tons. In actuality however, each of the RTU’s was only producing an \naverage of 7.82 tons at the start of the pilot and the Refrigeration systems just .953 tons. The majority of the \n21.7% efficiency loss in the RTU’s and the 26.8% efficiency loss in the Refrigeration systems is directly \nattributable to the thermal degradation of the heat exchange surfaces. This is due in large part to thermal degradation \ncreating an insulating barrier to heat transfer through the tube walls. \nAfter the ECM was installed, the average efficiency in the RTU’s unit jumped up to 98% of design specifications \nor 9.8 tons each and the Refrigeration systems jumped up to 95.7% or 1.25 tons. This represents a 25.3% \nimprovement in efficiency over the baseline RTU numbers and a 31.2% improvement in efficiency over the \nbaseline Refrigeration numbers.\nOriginal Design\nEﬃciency\nASHRAE Projected\nEﬃciency Loss\nOver Time\nActual Major Restaurant Chain\nDesign Eﬃciency as\nMeasured In-Situ\nActual Major Restaurant Chain HVAC/R Operating Eﬃciency\nvs.", "tokens": 772, "chars": 3052, "pages": {"start": 5, "end": 7}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_117_chunk_0004", "next_id": "pdf_117_chunk_0006", "content_hash": "sha256:32dc8dd7df8d27d426be91a4bed116098dce52614e91056b8372823c022c0bb3"}

The average \ncost to operate the RTU’s as calculated in kW/ ton was 1.44 in the Baseline and the Refrigeration systems \naveraged 3.4. When new, the kW/ton rating for RTU’s like these usually ranges from 1.0 to 1.2 kW/ton and the \nRefrigeration systems range from 2.3 to 2.5. This means the Major Restaurant Chain franchisee was paying up to 30.9% more \nthan design for the energy to run the RTU’s, and up to 29.4% more to run the Refrigeration systems as a direct \nresult of the baseline reduced level of performance. These kW/ton ratings are very much in line with the \nASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers.\n  \nThe restored average kW/ton rating for the RTU’s following the ECM is now 1.12 and 2.68 kW/ton in the \nRefrigeration systems. This represents a 22.2% reduction in energy costs for the RTU’s and a 21.2% reduction \nfor the Refrigeration systems from the baseline for every ton of cooling produced. An added benefit to Major Restaurant Chain \nis the reduced cost to operate all of the systems combined to near original design specifications.\nThe $3,641 in annual energy savings generated during the pilot have resulted in a payback period to Major Restaurant Chain \nof approximately 10 months. Over just a few years these accumulated savings will greatly reduce the eventual \nCapEx costs to replace the systems when they finally reach the end of their useful life.   \n21.5%\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website.", "tokens": 869, "chars": 3183, "pages": {"start": 7, "end": 8}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_117_chunk_0005", "next_id": "pdf_117_chunk_0007", "content_hash": "sha256:f282c72f479367602a2f3a71cbeb365d3e1661b283b45366583b126a671b9dfa"}

Unfortunately power bills are not nearly as scientific a \nmethodology to determine energy savings as business owners would like to think. It is why the power \ncompanies don’t issue rebates based on power bills. The variables are many and controlling them is hard. One \ncommonly accepted way to view year-over-year savings resulting from an ECM (if in fact nothing inside the \nstore has changed) is to look at kWh usage in like periods and then normalize for weather through the use of \ncooling degree days (CDD’s). \nIn the Major Restaurant Chain pilot, this is a bit more complicated because not all of the cooling system equipment in each \nstore was treated. Given that nothing else in the store has changed, confidence is high that any and all kWh \nsavings achieved in the first month after the ECM is directly attributable to PermaFrost NMR®. \nThe total cooling system load at the time of the pilot is estimated to be 55% of the total power bill. The cooling \nsystem load averaged throughout the year however is estimated to be 40%. The cooling systems treated \nrepresent approximately 50-60% of the total cooling systems supporting the store.\nKWh Savings Attributable to PermaFrost NMR® \n*Orlando: Given 2014 was 18.5% warmer than the corresponding period in 2013 and the cooling systems represent 40% of the overall power bill throughout \nthe year, the kWh for 2014 was reduced by 7.4%.\n*Tamarac: Given 2014 was 25.9% warmer than the corresponding period in 2013 and the cooling systems represent 40% of the overall power bill throughout \nthe year, the kWh for 2014 was reduced by 10.4%.\nTamarac Location\n5/14/13 - 6/13/13\n(30 Days)\n5/13/14 - 6/12/14\n(30 Days)\nOrlando Location\nTotal kWh Used in Period\nAvg kWh Per Day \nNumber of CDD's\nTotal Adjusted kWh Used* in Period\nAvg Adjusted kWh Per Day\nNumber of kWh Saved Per Day\nPercentage kWh Savings per Day\nCost Per kWh Delivered\nEquivalent Monthly Cost Savings \nCost to Treat Store with 25-tons\nEstimated Project Payback Period\n51,840\n1,728\n395\n51,840\n1,728\n$0.1012\n50,920\n1,697\n468\n47,152\n1,572\n156\n9.0%\n$0.1012\n$473.62\n$3,125.00\n6.6 Months\n4/30/13 - 5/29/13  \n(30 Days)\n4/30/14 - 5/29/14\n(30 Days)\n42,039\n1,401\n347\n42,039\n1,401\n$0.1000\n40,320\n1,344\n437\n36,127\n1,204\n197\n14.0%\n$0.1000\n$591.00\n$3,125.00\n5.3 Months\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 822, "chars": 3016, "pages": {"start": 16, "end": 17}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_117_chunk_0014", "next_id": "pdf_117_chunk_0016", "content_hash": "sha256:e4c55981f6928b722dd8492bcc61611237540c763527188780fe947f01848104"}
