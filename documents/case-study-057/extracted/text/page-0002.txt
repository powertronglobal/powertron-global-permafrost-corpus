PermaFrost NMR® Performance Report
Healthcare IT Company A
June 20, 2013 
Executive Summary
         This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure 
(ECM) PermaFrost NMR® for Healthcare IT Company A located in [Florida Location]. Detailed 
forensic performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on a HVAC Equipment Manufacturer 60 ton SWVA DX unit. 
Immediately following the baseline testing, the unit was treated with the proper amount and type of 
PermaFrost NMR® product formulated for R-22 DX systems. Since there were no other ECM’s going on 
during this pilot project, the improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at the units is 
solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. The unit(s) now provides cooler/drier supply air while 
using less power. This greater operational efficiency is due to the restoration of the heat transfer ability of 
the evaporator and condenser coils.
Following treatment of PermaFrost NMR® the unit showed a substantial increase in coil capacity of 107,662 
Btuh or 14.3% improvement overall system efficiency. This restored capacity equates to 9 tons. The unit also 
showed a substantial reduction in Watts/Ton of 10.7% and a 14.3% improvement in the Enthalpy Delta. 
Additionally, the unit showed an 12.1% improvement in COP, which is another measurable way to view the 
thermodynamic enhancement of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. 
The result of the ECM improvements is a ROI to the customer of just 24.5 months. The tables of data and 
financial calculations are available for review at the end of this report.
