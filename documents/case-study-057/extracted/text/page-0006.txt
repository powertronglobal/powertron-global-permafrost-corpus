The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
 
kW= Volts X Amps * 1.47 / 1000 (3-phase)
 
 
Btuh Capacity = Measured CFM X 4.5 * Calculated Enthalpy Delta 
 
 
System Eﬃciency % = Actual Coil Capacity Btuh / Nominal Coil Capacity Btuh
 
 
kW per Ton = Measured kW / Measured Tons
 
 
COP = 12 / kW per ton / 3.412
