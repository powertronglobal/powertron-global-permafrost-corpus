Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken in accordance with IPMVP protocols to determine 
the avoided energy usage and the annualized Return on Investment (ROI) Healthcare IT Company A will realize by implementing this ECM:
Regression Analysis (accounts for the restored capacity brought about by PermaFrost NMR®) 
Adjusted Base Tonnage         71.87 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted Total Watts         762 Watts per Ton * 71.87 tons = 54,765 Total Watts
Adjusted Base kWh         (54,765 Total Watts / 1,000) * 4,212 Annual Operating hrs = 230,670 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM         230,670 kWh * $.11 = $25,374 USD
Post ECM kWh         (48,908 Total Watts / 1,000) * 4,212 Annual Operating hrs = 206,001kWh
Cost to Run After ECM         206,001 kWh * $.11 = $22,660 USD
Cost Savings per Month         ($25,374  - $22,660) / 12 = $226
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® @ $5,530 / $226 = 24.5 months
 
ROI = 24.5 months
