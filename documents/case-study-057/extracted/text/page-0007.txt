Baseline & Energy Reporting (Post) Periods
The baseline data was recorded on 4/22/13 using recently calibrated devices to insure measurement 
accuracy. The following results were recorded as a result of the implementation of the IPMVP Protocol. The 
identical IPMVP data recordings from the baseline were recorded on 6/19/13 using the same recently NIST 
calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. The Energy Reporting Period measurements are as 
follows:
 
The post DB temperature (75.6 deg. F) entering the coil was matched as close as possible to the baseline 
period (75 deg. F). After matching this temperature the post readings were taken to ensure that the work the 
coil had to do was as close as possible in the baseline. Normalizing the post amperage was not required in 
this case due to the OAT and incoming tower water being the same during both measurement periods.
