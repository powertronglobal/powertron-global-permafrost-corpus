PermaFrost NMR® Performance Report
Healthcare IT Company A
June 20, 2013 
Executive Summary
         This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure 
(ECM) PermaFrost NMR® for Healthcare IT Company A located in [Florida Location]. Detailed 
forensic performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on a HVAC Equipment Manufacturer 60 ton SWVA DX unit. 
Immediately following the baseline testing, the unit was treated with the proper amount and type of 
PermaFrost NMR® product formulated for R-22 DX systems. Since there were no other ECM’s going on 
during this pilot project, the improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at the units is 
solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. The unit(s) now provides cooler/drier supply air while 
using less power. This greater operational efficiency is due to the restoration of the heat transfer ability of 
the evaporator and condenser coils.
Following treatment of PermaFrost NMR® the unit showed a substantial increase in coil capacity of 107,662 
Btuh or 14.3% improvement overall system efficiency. This restored capacity equates to 9 tons. The unit also 
showed a substantial reduction in Watts/Ton of 10.7% and a 14.3% improvement in the Enthalpy Delta. 
Additionally, the unit showed an 12.1% improvement in COP, which is another measurable way to view the 
thermodynamic enhancement of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. 
The result of the ECM improvements is a ROI to the customer of just 24.5 months. The tables of data and 
financial calculations are available for review at the end of this report.

Product Brief
         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure 
(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative® (NMR) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, 
one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any 
type of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVAC/R systems and 
equipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); 
chilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia 
refrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The 
equipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single 
and multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and 
improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point temperatures in a more 
rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from the 
enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW hours 
used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced carbon footprint 
for Healthcare IT Company A.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) is utilized in the 
development of this report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, 
Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization 
(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation 
methods and products.
There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They 
are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Retrofit Isolation 
(Option B) is defined as: All parameter measurement with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as 
the single source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the 
energy conservation method affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the 
baseline data.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term 
measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by 
short-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using 
measurements of proxies of energy use.
The final computation follows the formula:
Energy Science Division
Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy
+ - Routine adjustments / + - Non-Routine Adjustments

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content of the following report will demonstrate the effects of PermaFrost NMR®’s ability to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces. 
It was determined with Healthcare IT Company A to treat one 60-ton DX unit. A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment is 
implemented to determine if the unit’s operational conditions are satisfactory. Baseline measurements will 
be recorded and then the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® will be injected. The product will 
be allowed 4 weeks to seat itself into the metal surfaces. At the end of this gestation period, Post M&V 
results were taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same or very 
similar entering air temperatures and compressor discharge pressures. These are the two most critical 
measurements affected by the weather. Some units in this report required normalization due to weather.
During the avoided energy reporting period it was determined that the refrigerant pressure and 
temperature was not as per design. Management engaged the services of a mechanical contractor and this 
condition was resolved by adding seven (7) pounds of R-22 refrigerant. Powertron Global® has no 
knowledge as to why the refrigerant level was low or what if any repairs were required.  However after 
refrigerant was added, the refrigerant pressures and temperature meets the industry standards for this type 
of equipment. Post analysis was completed after the refrigerant issue was resolved. 
It was determined with Healthcare IT Company A that the units run approximately 4212 hours annually at a kWh cost of .11 cents 
per kW. 
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP International Performance Measurement and 
Verification Protocol as the M&V plan. Powertron Global®’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer, Edward R. 
[Senior Energy Engineer], performed the final calculations and measurements.

Baseline & Energy Reporting (Post) Periods
The baseline data was recorded on 4/22/13 using recently calibrated devices to insure measurement 
accuracy. The following results were recorded as a result of the implementation of the IPMVP Protocol. The 
identical IPMVP data recordings from the baseline were recorded on 6/19/13 using the same recently NIST 
calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. The Energy Reporting Period measurements are as 
follows:
 
The post DB temperature (75.6 deg. F) entering the coil was matched as close as possible to the baseline 
period (75 deg. F). After matching this temperature the post readings were taken to ensure that the work the 
coil had to do was as close as possible in the baseline. Normalizing the post amperage was not required in 
this case due to the OAT and incoming tower water being the same during both measurement periods.

Results
Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken in accordance with IPMVP protocols to determine 
the avoided energy usage and the annualized Return on Investment (ROI) Healthcare IT Company A will realize by implementing this ECM:
Regression Analysis (accounts for the restored capacity brought about by PermaFrost NMR®) 
Adjusted Base Tonnage         71.87 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted Total Watts         762 Watts per Ton * 71.87 tons = 54,765 Total Watts
Adjusted Base kWh         (54,765 Total Watts / 1,000) * 4,212 Annual Operating hrs = 230,670 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM         230,670 kWh * $.11 = $25,374 USD
Post ECM kWh         (48,908 Total Watts / 1,000) * 4,212 Annual Operating hrs = 206,001kWh
Cost to Run After ECM         206,001 kWh * $.11 = $22,660 USD
Cost Savings per Month         ($25,374  - $22,660) / 12 = $226
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® @ $5,530 / $226 = 24.5 months
 
ROI = 24.5 months
