Detailed \nforensic performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on a HVAC Equipment Manufacturer 60 ton SWVA DX unit. \nImmediately following the baseline testing, the unit was treated with the proper amount and type of \nPermaFrost NMR® product formulated for R-22 DX systems. Since there were no other ECM’s going on \nduring this pilot project, the improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at the units is \nsolely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. The unit(s) now provides cooler/drier supply air while \nusing less power. This greater operational efficiency is due to the restoration of the heat transfer ability of \nthe evaporator and condenser coils.\nFollowing treatment of PermaFrost NMR® the unit showed a substantial increase in coil capacity of 107,662 \nBtuh or 14.3% improvement overall system efficiency. This restored capacity equates to 9 tons. The unit also \nshowed a substantial reduction in Watts/Ton of 10.7% and a 14.3% improvement in the Enthalpy Delta. \nAdditionally, the unit showed an 12.1% improvement in COP, which is another measurable way to view the \nthermodynamic enhancement of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. \nThe result of the ECM improvements is a ROI to the customer of just 24.5 months. The tables of data and \nfinancial calculations are available for review at the end of this report.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 556, "chars": 2490, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_058_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:183ab696cfce2b5b4812acfba6f53401fcd352b82342de4bd3d9684742f441b4"}

A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any \ntype of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVAC/R systems and \nequipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); \nchilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia \nrefrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The \nequipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single \nand multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and \nimproved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point temperatures in a more \nrapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from the \nenhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW hours \nused, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced carbon footprint \nfor Healthcare IT Company A.\nEnergy Science Division\nBOUNDARY LAYER\nOIL REMOVED\nBEFORE TREATMENT\nAFTER TREATMENT\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 433, "chars": 2062, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_058_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_058_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:5014a1b27f3a91b54e0e2fcc30f18ca796c36c2229b038adf3d3f8d699ef00e1"}

The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, \nRefrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization \n(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation \nmethods and products.\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Retrofit Isolation \n(Option B) is defined as: All parameter measurement with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as \nthe single source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the \nenergy conservation method affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the \nbaseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using \nmeasurements of proxies of energy use.\nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+ - Routine adjustments / + - Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 439, "chars": 2181, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_058_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_058_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:2734a799bf1ce5fe1e00946b1913e1b02cfc3547e4e02aa86f52aff9add11212"}

A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment is \nimplemented to determine if the unit’s operational conditions are satisfactory. Baseline measurements will \nbe recorded and then the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® will be injected. The product will \nbe allowed 4 weeks to seat itself into the metal surfaces. At the end of this gestation period, Post M&V \nresults were taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same or very \nsimilar entering air temperatures and compressor discharge pressures. These are the two most critical \nmeasurements affected by the weather. Some units in this report required normalization due to weather.\nDuring the avoided energy reporting period it was determined that the refrigerant pressure and \ntemperature was not as per design. Management engaged the services of a mechanical contractor and this \ncondition was resolved by adding seven (7) pounds of R-22 refrigerant. Powertron Global® has no \nknowledge as to why the refrigerant level was low or what if any repairs were required.  However after \nrefrigerant was added, the refrigerant pressures and temperature meets the industry standards for this type \nof equipment. Post analysis was completed after the refrigerant issue was resolved. \nIt was determined with Healthcare IT Company A that the units run approximately 4212 hours annually at a kWh cost of .11 cents \nper kW. \nThe following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP International Performance Measurement and \nVerification Protocol as the M&V plan. Powertron Global®’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer, Edward R. \n[Senior Energy Engineer], performed the final calculations and measurements.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\nMake\nModel \nSerial\nRefrigerant Type\nAge\nNominal Cooling Capacity Btuh \nTonnage\n HVAC Equipment Manufacturer\nSWVA-6004-RAV\nL84G21061\n R-22\n 1984\n 720,000 Btuh\n 60\nThe results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:\n \n \nkW= Volts X Amps * 1.47 / 1000 (3-phase)\n \n \nBtuh Capacity = Measured CFM X 4.5 * Calculated Enthalpy Delta \n \n \nSystem Eﬃciency % = Actual Coil Capacity Btuh / Nominal Coil Capacity Btuh\n \n \nkW per Ton = Measured kW / Measured Tons\n \n \nCOP = 12 / kW per ton / 3.412\nSystem Description / Design Characteristics\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 771, "chars": 3471, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 6}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_058_chunk_0003", "next_id": "pdf_058_chunk_0005", "content_hash": "sha256:47bb2e013ac56aeb687f0c5c93d9686aeee054826929f1a5dbe5620c6c27d96f"}

The following results were recorded as a result of the implementation of the IPMVP Protocol. The \nidentical IPMVP data recordings from the baseline were recorded on 6/19/13 using the same recently NIST \ncalibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. The Energy Reporting Period measurements are as \nfollows:\n \nThe post DB temperature (75.6 deg. F) entering the coil was matched as close as possible to the baseline \nperiod (75 deg. F). After matching this temperature the post readings were taken to ensure that the work the \ncoil had to do was as close as possible in the baseline. Normalizing the post amperage was not required in \nthis case due to the OAT and incoming tower water being the same during both measurement periods. \nEnergy Science Division\nPOST\nBASELINE\nVoltage\nAmperage\nSuction Refrigerant Temp\nDischarge Refrigerant Temp\nEntering Air Temp DB\nLeaving Air Temp DB\nEntering Air Temp WB\nLeaving Air Temp WB\nActual CFM\nActual Coil Capacity Btuh / Tons\nEnthalpy Delta\nCalculated Watts\nCalculated Watts per Ton\nOutdoor Air Temp (OAT)\nIncoming Tower Water\n476.56 V\n68.43 A\n34.2 deg F\n104.2 deg F\n75 deg F\n55.5 deg F\n62.7 deg F\n48.3 deg F\n18,678.4 CFM\n754,794.14 Btuh / 62.9 Tons\n8.98\n47,938\n762\n76 deg F \n85 deg F \n485.50 V\n68.53 A \n36.5 deg F\n100.8 deg F\n75.6 deg F\n49.9 deg F\n60.3 deg F\n42.5 deg F\n18,680 CFM\n862,455.6 Btuh / 71.87 Tons\n10.26\n48,909\n681\n76 deg F \n85.5 deg F \nMEASUREMENT\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\nResults\nUtilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken in accordance with IPMVP protocols to determine \nthe avoided energy usage and the annualized Return on Investment (ROI) Healthcare IT Company A will realize by implementing this ECM:\nRegression Analysis (accounts for the restored capacity brought about by PermaFrost NMR®) \nAdjusted Base Tonnage         71.87 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)\nAdjusted Total Watts         762 Watts per Ton * 71.87 tons = 54,765 Total Watts\nAdjusted Base kWh         (54,765 Total Watts / 1,000) * 4,212 Annual Operating hrs = 230,670 kWh\nRevised Cost to Run Prior to ECM         230,670 kWh * $.11 = $25,374 USD\nPost ECM kWh         (48,908 Total Watts / 1,000) * 4,212 Annual Operating hrs = 206,001kWh\nCost to Run After ECM         206,001 kWh * $.11 = $22,660 USD\nCost Savings per Month         ($25,374  - $22,660) / 12 = $226\nCost of PermaFrost NMR® @ $5,530 / $226 = 24.5 months\n \nROI = 24.5 months\nEnergy Science Division\nEﬃciency Improvements\nTotal Watts\nWatts per Ton\nBtuh Capacity\nSystem Eﬃciency %\nEnthalpy Delta\nCOP\n-10.7%\n-10.7%\n+14.3%\n+14.3%\n+14.3%\n+12.1%\nEnergy Reporting Period\n48,909\n681\n862,456\n120%\n10.26\n5.17\nBaseline\n54,772\n762\n754,794\n105%\n8.98\n4.61\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 1058, "chars": 3787, "pages": {"start": 6, "end": 8}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_058_chunk_0004", "next_id": "", "content_hash": "sha256:22a6a287c044cf77e77085b10a749c90895674e65a36e769e0a88e9144255629"}
