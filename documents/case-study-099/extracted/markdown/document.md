Study Overview

This report details the results of the recently completed energy performance study conducted at the Commercial Real Estate Developer

Residential Complex A overlooking the Hudson River in midtown [NYC Location].

Running from 3 – 17 September 2015, the pilot was designed to illustrate the positive impact the PermaFrost

NMR® energy control measure (ECM) would have on the overall cooling performance of a 15 year old system

supporting one of the main elevator motor rooms.

As demonstrated in this field trial, PermaFrost NMR® restores the capacity lost over time due to fouling of the

heat exchange surfaces. This improvement in thermal performance will manifest itself in any or all of the

following ways:

• Restored additional capacity to better satisfy fluctuating building or operational loads

• Additional critical HVAC redundancy at no extra cost or interruption to facility operations

• Improved system efficiency, lowering cost to produce each ton of cooling required (i.e., kW/ton)

• Restored thermal efficiency allowing system to achieve thermostat set points faster, reducing

runtime (i.e., kWh) and extending useful equipment life an average of 15%

The improvements demonstrated in this or any field test resulting from PermaFrost NMR® are dependent on

factors such as age, condition, service history, runtime of one or both compressors and the design and

application of each system. The results in this pilot were very consistent with 15-year historical performance

averages as well as the recent laboratory study completed in May, 2015 by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) in

their testing chambers in [Texas Location], TX.

Objectives

The four key objectives for this jointly-conducted PermaFrost NMR® pilot study between Commercial Real Estate Developer, HVAC Contractor A

Enterprises and the Powertron Global Engineering team were all achieved.  They included:

1. Determine that the “as-is” capacity and efficiency of the pilot system supporting the Residential Complex A

complex had degraded by at least 10% after 15 years in operation.

2. Demonstrate that at least 10% performance improvement in both tonnage and kW/ton occurred in

the pilot cooling system after being treated with the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.

3. Demonstrate the ability of the system to produce cooler, drier air as measured in both Dry Bulb and

Wet Bulb deltas after being installed.

4. To support an effective business case for further deployments of the ECM within the Commercial Real Estate Developer

portfolio of properties, demonstrate financial benefits associated with efficiency improvements

realized over the duration of the study. These benefits must be equivalent to a 24-month or less

payback to Commercial Real Estate Developer on their initial project costs.

The cooling system involved in the study is recorded as follows:

York, Mfg date: 2000, R22, 480 volt-3 Phase, Model D2SK120A46

Methodology

After verifying the amount of air flowing across the evaporator coils before beginning each pilot, the

subsequent measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected using AHRI Standard 340/360 and

compiled in accordance with Option B of the IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol)

framework.

The results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic

engineering formulas:

• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase)

• kW/ton = Actual Measured Energy / Actual Measured Capacity

• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = 12 / (kW/ton) /3.412

• Actual Cooling Capacity per Hour = (Measured CFM * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta T) / 12,000 BTU

Recovered Unit Cost with PermaFrost NMR® ECM

The kW/ton is the standard Unit Cost in the HVAC

industry. It is the HVAC industry’s standard of

determining how much energy is required to create 1 ton

of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you reduce your

unit cost of cooling you are saving regardless of how

much cooling is required.

The chart to the right clearly illustrates the amount of

efficiency restoration the ECM created in the pilot system

after installation. The system is now performing 26.6%

more efficiently than before being installed.  This

degradation in operational efficiency is costing

Commercial Real Estate Developer a substantial amount of money in wasted

energy.

Annual Internal Rate of Return = 154%

Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 768%

Explanation of Regression Analysis

Utilizing data collected during the pilot study, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Commercial Real Estate Developer

Residential Complex A for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy

savings resulting from the improvement in both capacity and efficiency. Working together, these improvements reduce the annual

kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the cooling system was when

operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available capacity and then subtracting the

revised cost to run the cooling system at the same restored capacity after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed. This

regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or load % at which the

system will now operate due to the restored performance profile. This restored performance profile allows the cooling system to

satisfy the internal area set point with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.

Capital Improvements Detail

The capacity recovered after the PermaFrost NMR®  treatment has substantial capital benefits including cost

avoidance, deferred capital expense, and capital improvement in addition to the reduced energy cost to run the

systems. These are instantaneous benefits realized at installation.

Treating the HVAC system with PermaFrost NMR® allows Commercial Real Estate Developer Residential Complex A to realize the 
following ﬁnancial beneﬁts:

1. Restoration of 2.61 tons of HVAC Capacity. (Current rate to purchase commercial rooftop HVAC

capacity is ~ $1000 per ton installed).

2. Deferred Capital Cost. (Extending the remaining useful life of HVAC equipment will defer capital

cost of replacement. Using five years (30%) service life remaining, the systems will experience an

estimated 1-1.5 years of additional service life, deferring replacement costs by 20%).

3. Capital Improvement Deduction. (Improving performance and extending the useful life of existing

equipment allows for a capital expense classification. This classification enhances EBITDA, reduces

exposure, and preserves asset value while deducting the expense over the remaining life of the system

~ 5 years).

Commercial Real Estate Developer Residential Complex A  is Saving More than Just Energy and
Preserving Capital

By installing PermaFrost NMR® in the pilot cooling system plus all the other approximately 350 tons of

common area cooling systems in Residential Complex A, based on the manner in which the systems are currently being

operated, Commercial Real Estate Developer would save approximately 395,500 kWh per year and all the costs associated with those

savings. From an environmental impact standpoint, Commercial Real Estate Developer will also benefit all the surrounding New York

area communities in which they operate.  Imagine the positive environmental impacts of treating the rest of

Commercial Real Estate Developer portfolio of buildings.

The 395,500 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 273 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from

being released or any of the following:

Annual greenhouse emissions from:
