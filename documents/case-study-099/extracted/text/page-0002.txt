Study Overview
This report details the results of the recently completed energy performance study conducted at the Commercial Real Estate Developer 
Residential Complex A overlooking the Hudson River in midtown [NYC Location].
Running from 3 – 17 September 2015, the pilot was designed to illustrate the positive impact the PermaFrost 
NMR® energy control measure (ECM) would have on the overall cooling performance of a 15 year old system 
supporting one of the main elevator motor rooms.  
As demonstrated in this field trial, PermaFrost NMR® restores the capacity lost over time due to fouling of the 
heat exchange surfaces. This improvement in thermal performance will manifest itself in any or all of the 
following ways:
 
• Restored additional capacity to better satisfy fluctuating building or operational loads  
 
• Additional critical HVAC redundancy at no extra cost or interruption to facility operations
 
• Improved system efficiency, lowering cost to produce each ton of cooling required (i.e., kW/ton)
 
• Restored thermal efficiency allowing system to achieve thermostat set points faster, reducing 
 
    runtime (i.e., kWh) and extending useful equipment life an average of 15% 
The improvements demonstrated in this or any field test resulting from PermaFrost NMR® are dependent on 
factors such as age, condition, service history, runtime of one or both compressors and the design and 
application of each system. The results in this pilot were very consistent with 15-year historical performance 
averages as well as the recent laboratory study completed in May, 2015 by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) in 
their testing chambers in [Texas Location], TX.
