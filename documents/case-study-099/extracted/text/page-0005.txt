Methodology
After verifying the amount of air flowing across the evaporator coils before beginning each pilot, the 
subsequent measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected using AHRI Standard 340/360 and 
compiled in accordance with Option B of the IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) 
framework. 
The results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic 
engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• kW/ton = Actual Measured Energy / Actual Measured Capacity 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = 12 / (kW/ton) /3.412
 
• Actual Cooling Capacity per Hour = (Measured CFM * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta T) / 12,000 BTU
Recovered Unit Cost with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
The kW/ton is the standard Unit Cost in the HVAC 
industry. It is the HVAC industry’s standard of 
determining how much energy is required to create 1 ton 
of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you reduce your 
unit cost of cooling you are saving regardless of how 
much cooling is required.
The chart to the right clearly illustrates the amount of 
efficiency restoration the ECM created in the pilot system 
after installation. The system is now performing 26.6% 
more efficiently than before being installed.  This 
degradation in operational efficiency is costing 
Commercial Real Estate Developer a substantial amount of money in wasted 
energy.
