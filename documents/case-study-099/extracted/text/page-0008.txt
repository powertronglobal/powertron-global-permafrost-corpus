Energy Consumption & Financial Detail
The following are the final calculated performance measurements before and after PermaFrost NMR® ECM was 
installed.
Avg. Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Capacity:  9.27 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline:  1.43 kW/ton * 11.88 tons = 16.99 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh:  16.99 kW * 2,500 Annual Operating Hrs = 42,475 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 42,475 kWh * $.17 = $7,221
Avg. Post Energy Consumption
kW Post:  1.05 kW/ton * 11.88 tons = 12.47 kW
Annual kWh Post:  12.47 kW * 2,500 hours = 31,175 kWh
Annual Cost Post:  31,175 kWh * $.17 cents = $5,300
Avg. Savings per Year Per System
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year:  $7,221 - $5,300 = $1,921
Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $1,921 / 12 = $160
Payback Period
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot cooling system: $1,250
Estimated ROI Period for Commercial Real Estate Developer when treating the pilot cooling system: $1,250 / $160 = ~7.8 Months
Return on Investment
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 154%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 768%
Explanation of Regression Analysis
Utilizing data collected during the pilot study, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Commercial Real Estate Developer 
Residential Complex A for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in both capacity and efficiency. Working together, these improvements reduce the annual 
kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the cooling system was when 
operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available capacity and then subtracting the 
revised cost to run the cooling system at the same restored capacity after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed. This 
regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or load % at which the 
system will now operate due to the restored performance profile. This restored performance profile allows the cooling system to 
satisfy the internal area set point with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
