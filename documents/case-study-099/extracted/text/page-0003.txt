cooling capacity jumped 28.2% to 11.88 tons. 
• The cost to produce each ton of cooling on the pilot system dropped 26.6% from 1.43 kW/ton in the 
baseline to 1.05 kW/ton after installation.  
• The Coefficient of Performance (COP) improved 36.6% from an average of 2.46 in the baseline to 3.36 
following installation. 
• The cost to operate the system at a cost of $.17 per kWh delivered fell 26.6% from $7,221 in the 
baseline to $5,300 following installation.
• The cost to treat the system of $1,250 divided by the annual savings achieved of $1,934 results in an 
average initial payback period of 7.8 months.
