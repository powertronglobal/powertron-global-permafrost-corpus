This improvement in thermal performance will manifest itself in any or all of the \nfollowing ways:\n \n• Restored additional capacity to better satisfy fluctuating building or operational loads  \n \n• Additional critical HVAC redundancy at no extra cost or interruption to facility operations\n \n• Improved system efficiency, lowering cost to produce each ton of cooling required (i.e., kW/ton)\n \n• Restored thermal efficiency allowing system to achieve thermostat set points faster, reducing \n \n    runtime (i.e., kWh) and extending useful equipment life an average of 15% \nThe improvements demonstrated in this or any field test resulting from PermaFrost NMR® are dependent on \nfactors such as age, condition, service history, runtime of one or both compressors and the design and \napplication of each system. The results in this pilot were very consistent with 15-year historical performance \naverages as well as the recent laboratory study completed in May, 2015 by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) in \ntheir testing chambers in [Texas Location], TX. \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 613, "chars": 2918, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_097_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:8462a3e8e9ab41cf384543a8c86a27e4e02ee34a558e1139524f5002cccc285f"}

They included: \n \n1. Determine that the “as-is” capacity and efficiency of the pilot system supporting the Residential Complex A \n \n    complex had degraded by at least 10% after 15 years in operation.  \n \n2. Demonstrate that at least 10% performance improvement in both tonnage and kW/ton occurred in \n \n    the pilot cooling system after being treated with the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. \n \n3. Demonstrate the ability of the system to produce cooler, drier air as measured in both Dry Bulb and \n \n    Wet Bulb deltas after being installed.  \n \n4. To support an effective business case for further deployments of the ECM within the Commercial Real Estate Developer \n \n    portfolio of properties, demonstrate financial benefits associated with efficiency improvements \n \n    realized over the duration of the study. These benefits must be equivalent to a 24-month or less \n \n    payback to Commercial Real Estate Developer on their initial project costs.  \nThe cooling system involved in the study is recorded as follows:\n \nYork, Mfg date: 2000, R22, 480 volt-3 Phase, Model D2SK120A46\nECM Product Brief\nPermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented surface science nanotechnology that uses Nucleo Molecular \nRegenerative (NMR®) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, one-time treatment with no down time \nrequired, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type of climate control system in which it is \ninstalled.  The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling efficiency and increased capacity. \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 496, "chars": 2247, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_097_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_097_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:6594bfc6d450d4f0f400b12723e1e5c42b7cfeff1175ce8672def57afebf1152"}

It is the HVAC industry’s standard of \ndetermining how much energy is required to create 1 ton \nof cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you reduce your \nunit cost of cooling you are saving regardless of how \nmuch cooling is required.\nThe chart to the right clearly illustrates the amount of \nefficiency restoration the ECM created in the pilot system \nafter installation. The system is now performing 26.6% \nmore efficiently than before being installed.

Savings per Year Per System\nAvoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year:  $7,221 - $5,300 = $1,921\nEstimated Energy Savings per Month: $1,921 / 12 = $160\nPayback Period\nCost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot cooling system: $1,250\nEstimated ROI Period for Commercial Real Estate Developer when treating the pilot cooling system: $1,250 / $160 = ~7.8 Months\nReturn on Investment\nAnnual Internal Rate of Return = 154%\nReturn on Investment Over 5 Years = 768%\nExplanation of Regression Analysis\nUtilizing data collected during the pilot study, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Commercial Real Estate Developer \nResidential Complex A for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy \nsavings resulting from the improvement in both capacity and efficiency. Working together, these improvements reduce the annual \nkWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the cooling system was when \noperating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available capacity and then subtracting the \nrevised cost to run the cooling system at the same restored capacity after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed. This \nregression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or load % at which the \nsystem will now operate due to the restored performance profile. This restored performance profile allows the cooling system to \nsatisfy the internal area set point with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 673, "chars": 2854, "pages": {"start": 7, "end": 8}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_097_chunk_0005", "next_id": "pdf_097_chunk_0007", "content_hash": "sha256:87216073438e0885a5c8fad75a1a26b235416667b14e74ac34279d36d915a031"}

These are instantaneous benefits realized at installation.\nTreating the HVAC system with PermaFrost NMR® allows Commercial Real Estate Developer Residential Complex A to realize the \nfollowing ﬁnancial beneﬁts: \n \n1. Restoration of 2.61 tons of HVAC Capacity. (Current rate to purchase commercial rooftop HVAC \n \n    capacity is ~ $1000 per ton installed). \n \n2. Deferred Capital Cost. (Extending the remaining useful life of HVAC equipment will defer capital \n \n    cost of replacement. Using five years (30%) service life remaining, the systems will experience an \n \n    estimated 1-1.5 years of additional service life, deferring replacement costs by 20%). \n \n3. Capital Improvement Deduction. (Improving performance and extending the useful life of existing \n \n    equipment allows for a capital expense classification. This classification enhances EBITDA, reduces \n \n    exposure, and preserves asset value while deducting the expense over the remaining life of the system \n \n    ~ 5 years). \n8\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\n57.4\nPassenger vehicles\n14\nGarbage trucks of waste sent to\nthe landﬁll instead of recycled\n30,687\nGallons of gasoline\nconsumed\n292,930\nPounds of coal burned\nannually\n634\nBarrels of oil\nconsumed\n37.5\nHomes’ electricity use for\none year\n9\nCommercial Real Estate Developer Residential Complex A  is Saving More than Just Energy and\nPreserving Capital\nBy installing PermaFrost NMR® in the pilot cooling system plus all the other approximately 350 tons of \ncommon area cooling systems in Residential Complex A, based on the manner in which the systems are currently being \noperated, Commercial Real Estate Developer would save approximately 395,500 kWh per year and all the costs associated with those \nsavings.
