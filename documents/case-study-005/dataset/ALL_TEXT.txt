HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report
Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study
The purpose of this study is to verify the industry wide problem of efficiency loss in HVAC/R as projected by
ASHRAE research and to quantify the amount of money wasted due to this loss. Many industry leading 
organizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age. 
Thermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVACR equipment that operates as a 
vapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well 
documented by the HVACR industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal degradation 
prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times and 
additional kWh consumption.
The representative sample of equipment in this study is an agreed upon sampling that represents the portfolio 
of equipment operated by ACM Theatres. If thermal degradation is present in these machines it is present in the 
entire inventory of equipment. Energy waste can be calculated based on this equipment (portfolio 
representation) and then accurately extrapolated across the entire inventory of equipment.
[HVAC Field Technician] from HVAC Services Provider/HVAC Equipment Manufacturer prepares to manually 
operate one of the units involved in the Major US Theater Chain pilot to collect all the 
pertinent power data while all 6 compressors are running at 100%. 
Above image is one of the seven HVAC Equipment Manufacturer Intellipak systems 
supporting the Major US Theater Chain [Location] facility. Three of these 
90-ton RTU’s were forensically tested using the IPMVP 
methodology to determine their performance capabilities.

Process
This report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of the large rooftop 
packaged units (RTU’s) that support the Major US Theater Chain [Location] theater facility in [Texas City]. 
Detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on three of the units before and 
after the installation of the ECM to determine the impact on the three key elements that greatly affect Major US Theater Chain’s 
HVAC power bill as they relate to the original design specifications:
 
1.  The cooling capacity the RTUs are capable of producing after 16 years in service. 
2.  The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the RTUs are delivering as 
     reflected in the kW/ton measurement. 
3.  The thermal dynamic ability of the equipment to still perform at or close to operational design.
Methodology
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the 
IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted of Powertron 
Global’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer] and [HVAC Field Technician], Sr. Field Technician for [Virginia Location] 
Services /HVAC Equipment Manufacturer. Under contract to maintain the equipment, HVAC Services Provider participated in the entire testing 
process and was a tremendous help with their intricate knowledge of the nuances associated with each of the 
pilot units. 
Notes 
The day chosen to test was the most common type of day in Houston of approximately 80 degrees according to national 
BIN data. The weather conditions along with the moviegoers patronizing the theater provided an adequate heat load on 
the facility to ensure all compressors would remain running during the actual data collection period required for each. 
The boundary of the testing was each of the RTU’s and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the 
performance calculations is very high.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the three pilot RTUs to perform prior to 
the ECM being installed, as well as illustrate the thermal degradation that naturally occurs in heat
exchangers over time.
 
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
• Ton = (Airflow * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta) / 12,000 
• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
Notes 
Following a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to determine the operational condition of the systems was 
satisfactory, Baseline M&V data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. Forty days after installation of the ECM, 
the M&V team returned on a very similar weather day to the Baseline to take Post M&V measurements in the identical 
fashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements and associated calculations show the amount of capacity 
restored.
During the course of the testing, it was discovered that all 18 of the compressors in the three RTUs measured have been 
replaced at least one time in the 16 years each of the RTUs has been in operation. In general though, the RTUs were 
determined to be performing satisfactorily from a mechanical standpoint at the start of the testing period.
The following IPMVP data points were recorded on 28 October 2013 using recently calibrated devices by NIST 
(National Institutes of Standards and Technology) to insure measurement accuracy. The three RTUs were then treated 
with PermaFrost NMR® on 4 April 2014 and allowed to run normally until 12 May 2014 to ensure the patented 
surface science nanotechnology had ample time to seat into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All 
measurements were taken at full load (all compressors running) and at identical outdoor air temperatures and similar 
mid-day times and attendance.
The collection of the data in both the baseline and post periods was assisted and witnessed by HVAC Services Provider/HVAC Equipment Manufacturer.  
The measurements are listed below. Photographic evidence of each of the readings is also available under separate cover 
to validate the accuracy of the data.

Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results (across all 3 pilot units)
RTU Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Major US Theater Chain has the problem of thermal degradation in its HVAC/R units. The low operating tonnage & COP 
ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. The 
degraded equipment performance is costing Major US Theater Chain significant money and wasting energy. The equipment is 
using significantly more kWh to operate then it used when it was new. The efficiency summary includes all 
HVAC units measured, combining the current efficiency & tonnage of all units. This summary is the 
cumulative impact of thermal degradation on the portfolio sampling.
The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 72 operating tons and an average 
improvement of 42.8% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate.
The three units evaluated and treated are HVAC Equipment Manufacturer DX units with a nominal tonnage of 91.3 tons per unit, totaling 
273.9 tons.

Recovered Wasted Energy with ECM -  Chiller
The chart to the right illustrates the performance
restoration the ECM created in the treated RTUs.       . 
The average cost to operate these RTUs before 
they were treated with PermaFrost NMR® as 
calculated in kW/ton was 1.78.
The specific cost to operate these RTUs after they 
were treated with PermaFrost NMR® as 
calculated in kW/ton is currently 1.23.
The high baseline kW/ton ratings measured in-situ 
were expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimations 
for 16 year old equipment. The post results are also in 
line with the average improvement savings shown 
over more than 120,000 installations globally.
Cost Savings for Major US Theater Chain when Implementing ECM Portfolio-wide
The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in significant savings at [Location]. The annual 
kWh reduction is 833,565 kWh resulting in $75,021 in savings. These improvements extrapolated across Major US Theater Chain's 
entire portfolio, the estimated savings would be between 14M-16M.
Notes
The [Location] is one of the larger theaters in the portfolio with 650 tons of HVAC. The average amount of tonnage per 
facility is closer to 350 tons or 54% of the [Location]’s tonnage.

HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Calculated Eﬃciency of Major US Theater Chain HVAC RTUs Baseline and Post
The chart below illustrates just how far off design the Major US Theater Chain pilot RTUs had degraded in terms of efficiency 
over their 16 years of use. The three pilot RTUs (#2, #6 and #7) were performing at an average of 67% of the 
original design efficiency when first installed. The actual design rated tonnage of each of these RTUs is 91.3 
tons. In actuality however, the three RTUs were only producing an average of 61.1 tons at the start of the pilot. 
The majority of this 33% efficiency loss was directly attributable to the thermal degradation of the heat 
exchange surfaces. This is due in large part to thermal degradation creating an insulating barrier to heat transfer 
through the tube walls. 
After the ECM was installed, the average efficiency in each of the RTUs jumped up to 93% of design 
specifications or 85.1 tons. This represents a 39% increase in efficiency over the baseline numbers.

HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Cost to Major US Theater Chain to Operate the [Location] HVAC RTUs Baseline vs Post
The next chart illustrates the just how much money the efficiency performance loss in the pilot RTUs was 
costing Major US Theater Chain in the way of wasted energy each and every day they were operating prior to the ECM. The 
average cost to operate these three pilot RTUs as calculated in kW/ ton was 1.78 in the Baseline. When new, the 
kW/ton rating for units like these usually ranges from 1.0 to 1.2 kW/ton. This means Major US Theater Chain was paying up to 
48% more than design for energy to run the RTUs as a direct result of the baseline reduced level of 
performance. The kW/ton ratings measured on site in Houston were very much in line with the ASHRAE loss 
of performance and cost to operate numbers.
  
The restored average kW/ton rating following the ECM is now 1.23. This represents a 30.9% reduction in 
energy costs from the baseline for every ton of cooling produced. It also brings down the Major US Theater Chain costs to operate 
the RTUs to just 3% of design. This will result in an initial payback period to Major US Theater Chain of approximately 12-13 
months. Over just a few years these accumulated savings will greatly reduce the eventual CapEx costs to 
replace the RTUs when they finally reach the end of their useful life.

Return On Investment
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the three Major US Theater Chain Packaged RTUs.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 183.3 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: 1.78 kW/ton * 255.3 tons = 454.43 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 454.43 kW * 3,150 Annual Operating Hrs = 1,431,455 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 1,431,455 kWh * $.09 = $128,831
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: 1.23 kW/ton * 255.3 tons = 314.02 kW
Annual kWh Post: 314.02 kW * 3,150 hours = 989,163 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 989,163 kWh * .09 cents = $89,025
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $128,831 - $89,025 = $39,806
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $39,806 / 12 = $3,317
Return On Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in three pilot RTUs: $33,750
Estimated ROI Period for Major US Theater Chain on three RTUs: $33,750 / $3,317 = 10.2 months
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period 
for Major US Theater Chain for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true 
energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended 
in the Avoided Energy Reporting (Post) Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems 
was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity 
and then subtracting the revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® 
ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number 
of hours the systems will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the 
internal building set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.

Notes
The three pilot RTUs provide cooling to opposite

Given the weather BIN data of all hours over 55 
degrees in Houston (7,086), the internal load of 
the theaters combined with the hours of 
operations, and the size and age of the RTUs, it 
is estimated that the RTUs each run 
approximately 3,150 hours or more annually

degrees in Houston (7,086), the internal load of 
the theaters combined with the hours of 
operations, and the size and age of the RTUs, it 
is estimated that the RTUs each run 
approximately 3,150 hours or more annually 
prior to the ECM being implemented.  
*Measured AMPs were slightly lower than design as one condenser fan was having issues and was shut oﬀ
**Low refrigerant temps seemed to indicate unit was low on refrigerant and techs did not have any on hand so it was left alone for test
***Post CFM readings were within accepted tolerance of +/- 2% so the same reading was used as in the baseline
