Many industry leading \norganizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age. \nThermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVACR equipment that operates as a \nvapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well \ndocumented by the HVACR industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal degradation \nprevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times and \nadditional kWh consumption.\nThe representative sample of equipment in this study is an agreed upon sampling that represents the portfolio \nof equipment operated by ACM Theatres. If thermal degradation is present in these machines it is present in the \nentire inventory of equipment. Energy waste can be calculated based on this equipment (portfolio \nrepresentation) and then accurately extrapolated across the entire inventory of equipment.\n[HVAC Field Technician] from HVAC Services Provider/HVAC Equipment Manufacturer prepares to manually \noperate one of the units involved in the Major US Theater Chain pilot to collect all the \npertinent power data while all 6 compressors are running at 100%. \nAbove image is one of the seven HVAC Equipment Manufacturer Intellipak systems \nsupporting the Major US Theater Chain [Location] facility. Three of these \n90-ton RTU’s were forensically tested using the IPMVP \nmethodology to determine their performance capabilities. \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 624, "chars": 3036, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_015_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:079e5ceba32f58030533c18a89376be3ca856e844f9be1f9f3595a5bf07a6052"}

The cooling capacity the RTUs are capable of producing after 16 years in service. \n2.  The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the RTUs are delivering as \n     reflected in the kW/ton measurement. \n3.  The thermal dynamic ability of the equipment to still perform at or close to operational design.\nMethodology\nThe measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the \nIPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted of Powertron \nGlobal’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer] and [HVAC Field Technician], Sr. Field Technician for [Virginia Location] \nServices /HVAC Equipment Manufacturer. Under contract to maintain the equipment, HVAC Services Provider participated in the entire testing \nprocess and was a tremendous help with their intricate knowledge of the nuances associated with each of the \npilot units. \nNotes \nThe day chosen to test was the most common type of day in Houston of approximately 80 degrees according to national \nBIN data. The weather conditions along with the moviegoers patronizing the theater provided an adequate heat load on \nthe facility to ensure all compressors would remain running during the actual data collection period required for each. \nThe boundary of the testing was each of the RTU’s and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the \nperformance calculations is very high.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 518, "chars": 2627, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_015_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_015_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:5795e5ea1d0af79cfc1f4e73a924ca5ba71dde81d4957ff7c1fd8193e7f2a13c"}

Forty days after installation of the ECM, \nthe M&V team returned on a very similar weather day to the Baseline to take Post M&V measurements in the identical \nfashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements and associated calculations show the amount of capacity \nrestored.\nDuring the course of the testing, it was discovered that all 18 of the compressors in the three RTUs measured have been \nreplaced at least one time in the 16 years each of the RTUs has been in operation. In general though, the RTUs were \ndetermined to be performing satisfactorily from a mechanical standpoint at the start of the testing period.\nThe following IPMVP data points were recorded on 28 October 2013 using recently calibrated devices by NIST \n(National Institutes of Standards and Technology) to insure measurement accuracy. The three RTUs were then treated \nwith PermaFrost NMR® on 4 April 2014 and allowed to run normally until 12 May 2014 to ensure the patented \nsurface science nanotechnology had ample time to seat into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All \nmeasurements were taken at full load (all compressors running) and at identical outdoor air temperatures and similar \nmid-day times and attendance.\nThe collection of the data in both the baseline and post periods was assisted and witnessed by HVAC Services Provider/HVAC Equipment Manufacturer.  \nThe measurements are listed below. Photographic evidence of each of the readings is also available under separate cover \nto validate the accuracy of the data. \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 663, "chars": 2993, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_015_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_015_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:7b8117ac42d688e83b1eecd4d5e2b5645a0daacebc88a3de10f2704ef2f3b862"}

The three pilot RTUs (#2, #6 and #7) were performing at an average of 67% of the \noriginal design efficiency when first installed. The actual design rated tonnage of each of these RTUs is 91.3 \ntons. In actuality however, the three RTUs were only producing an average of 61.1 tons at the start of the pilot. \nThe majority of this 33% efficiency loss was directly attributable to the thermal degradation of the heat \nexchange surfaces. This is due in large part to thermal degradation creating an insulating barrier to heat transfer \nthrough the tube walls. \nAfter the ECM was installed, the average efficiency in each of the RTUs jumped up to 93% of design \nspecifications or 85.1 tons.

The \naverage cost to operate these three pilot RTUs as calculated in kW/ ton was 1.78 in the Baseline. When new, the \nkW/ton rating for units like these usually ranges from 1.0 to 1.2 kW/ton. This means Major US Theater Chain was paying up to \n48% more than design for energy to run the RTUs as a direct result of the baseline reduced level of \nperformance. The kW/ton ratings measured on site in Houston were very much in line with the ASHRAE loss \nof performance and cost to operate numbers.\n  \nThe restored average kW/ton rating following the ECM is now 1.23. This represents a 30.9% reduction in \nenergy costs from the baseline for every ton of cooling produced. It also brings down the Major US Theater Chain costs to operate \nthe RTUs to just 3% of design. This will result in an initial payback period to Major US Theater Chain of approximately 12-13 \nmonths. Over just a few years these accumulated savings will greatly reduce the eventual CapEx costs to \nreplace the RTUs when they finally reach the end of their useful life.   \nOriginal Design\nEﬃciency\nASHRAE Projected\nCost to Operate\nOver Time\nActual Cost to\nOperate Major US Theater Chain Theater\nSystems As Is\nOperational Cost %\nActual Major US Theater Chain Theatres HVAC/R Operating Cost\nvs. ASHRAE Historical Performance\n-40\n-20\n00\n20\n40\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n \n \n \nAvg Age of Major US Theater Chain \nEquipment\n16\nEXPECTED COST\nAge of HVAC/R Units\n31%\nin Energy\nSavings\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 587, "chars": 2339, "pages": {"start": 7, "end": 8}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_015_chunk_0006", "next_id": "pdf_015_chunk_0008", "content_hash": "sha256:2f4b12429853756636d7811056bea175c644cb21d1853eadc23632bedb18d879"}
