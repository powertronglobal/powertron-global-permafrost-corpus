Notes
The three pilot RTUs provide cooling to opposite 
sections of the Major US Theater Chain [Location] Theaters. 
Given the weather BIN data of all hours over 55 
degrees in Houston (7,086), the internal load of 
the theaters combined with the hours of 
operations, and the size and age of the RTUs, it 
is estimated that the RTUs each run 
approximately 3,150 hours or more annually 
prior to the ECM being implemented.  
*Measured AMPs were slightly lower than design as one condenser fan was having issues and was shut oﬀ
**Low refrigerant temps seemed to indicate unit was low on refrigerant and techs did not have any on hand so it was left alone for test
***Post CFM readings were within accepted tolerance of +/- 2% so the same reading was used as in the baseline
