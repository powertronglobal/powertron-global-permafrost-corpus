HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Cost to Major US Theater Chain to Operate the [Location] HVAC RTUs Baseline vs Post
The next chart illustrates the just how much money the efficiency performance loss in the pilot RTUs was 
costing Major US Theater Chain in the way of wasted energy each and every day they were operating prior to the ECM. The 
average cost to operate these three pilot RTUs as calculated in kW/ ton was 1.78 in the Baseline. When new, the 
kW/ton rating for units like these usually ranges from 1.0 to 1.2 kW/ton. This means Major US Theater Chain was paying up to 
48% more than design for energy to run the RTUs as a direct result of the baseline reduced level of 
performance. The kW/ton ratings measured on site in Houston were very much in line with the ASHRAE loss 
of performance and cost to operate numbers.
  
The restored average kW/ton rating following the ECM is now 1.23. This represents a 30.9% reduction in 
energy costs from the baseline for every ton of cooling produced. It also brings down the Major US Theater Chain costs to operate 
the RTUs to just 3% of design. This will result in an initial payback period to Major US Theater Chain of approximately 12-13 
months. Over just a few years these accumulated savings will greatly reduce the eventual CapEx costs to 
replace the RTUs when they finally reach the end of their useful life.
