Return On Investment
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the three Major US Theater Chain Packaged RTUs.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 183.3 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: 1.78 kW/ton * 255.3 tons = 454.43 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 454.43 kW * 3,150 Annual Operating Hrs = 1,431,455 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 1,431,455 kWh * $.09 = $128,831
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: 1.23 kW/ton * 255.3 tons = 314.02 kW
Annual kWh Post: 314.02 kW * 3,150 hours = 989,163 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 989,163 kWh * .09 cents = $89,025
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $128,831 - $89,025 = $39,806
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $39,806 / 12 = $3,317
Return On Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in three pilot RTUs: $33,750
Estimated ROI Period for Major US Theater Chain on three RTUs: $33,750 / $3,317 = 10.2 months
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period 
for Major US Theater Chain for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true 
energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended 
in the Avoided Energy Reporting (Post) Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems 
was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity 
and then subtracting the revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® 
ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number 
of hours the systems will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the 
internal building set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
