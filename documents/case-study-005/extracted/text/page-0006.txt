Recovered Wasted Energy with ECM -  Chiller
The chart to the right illustrates the performance
restoration the ECM created in the treated RTUs.       . 
The average cost to operate these RTUs before 
they were treated with PermaFrost NMR® as 
calculated in kW/ton was 1.78.
The specific cost to operate these RTUs after they 
were treated with PermaFrost NMR® as 
calculated in kW/ton is currently 1.23.
The high baseline kW/ton ratings measured in-situ 
were expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimations 
for 16 year old equipment. The post results are also in 
line with the average improvement savings shown 
over more than 120,000 installations globally.
Cost Savings for Major US Theater Chain when Implementing ECM Portfolio-wide
The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in significant savings at [Location]. The annual 
kWh reduction is 833,565 kWh resulting in $75,021 in savings. These improvements extrapolated across Major US Theater Chain's 
entire portfolio, the estimated savings would be between 14M-16M.
Notes
The [Location] is one of the larger theaters in the portfolio with 650 tons of HVAC. The average amount of tonnage per 
facility is closer to 350 tons or 54% of the [Location]’s tonnage.
