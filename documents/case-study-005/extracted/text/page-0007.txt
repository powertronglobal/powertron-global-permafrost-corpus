HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Calculated Eﬃciency of Major US Theater Chain HVAC RTUs Baseline and Post
The chart below illustrates just how far off design the Major US Theater Chain pilot RTUs had degraded in terms of efficiency 
over their 16 years of use. The three pilot RTUs (#2, #6 and #7) were performing at an average of 67% of the 
original design efficiency when first installed. The actual design rated tonnage of each of these RTUs is 91.3 
tons. In actuality however, the three RTUs were only producing an average of 61.1 tons at the start of the pilot. 
The majority of this 33% efficiency loss was directly attributable to the thermal degradation of the heat 
exchange surfaces. This is due in large part to thermal degradation creating an insulating barrier to heat transfer 
through the tube walls. 
After the ECM was installed, the average efficiency in each of the RTUs jumped up to 93% of design 
specifications or 85.1 tons. This represents a 39% increase in efficiency over the baseline numbers.
