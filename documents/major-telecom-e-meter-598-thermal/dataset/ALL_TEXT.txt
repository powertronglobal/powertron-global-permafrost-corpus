═══ METHODOLOGY ═══
Measurement Methodology
========================================

Data Type: Time Series
Total Measurements: 19,320

Source Data Files:
  - baseline_598_cleaned.csv: 8,630 rows (baseline period)
  - gpm_bin_comparison_598.csv: 2 rows (unknown period)
  - post_598_cleaned.csv: 10,688 rows (post period)

Measurement Protocol
----------------------------------------
This study follows the International Performance Measurement & Verification Protocol (IPMVP)
for collecting and analyzing HVAC performance data. Key metrics measured include:

  - Coefficient of Performance (COP)
  - Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER)
  - Power consumption (kW)
  - Cooling capacity (Tons)
  - kW per Ton efficiency
  - Outdoor air temperature
  - Chilled water flow rate (GPM)
  - Chilled water delta temperature

Measurements were collected at 2-second intervals using calibrated sensors
to capture transient system behavior and ensure statistical significance.

═══ TEMPERATURE ANALYSIS ═══
Temperature-Normalized Analysis
========================================

HVAC efficiency varies significantly with outdoor temperature.
This analysis normalizes results by temperature bins to ensure
fair comparison between baseline and post-treatment periods.

Overall Results (All Temperature Bins):
  Baseline Average: 0.749 kW/ton
  Post-Treatment Average: 0.595 kW/ton
  Improvement: 20.7%

The improvement percentage represents the reduction in electrical
power required to produce one ton of cooling capacity after
PermaFrost NMR treatment was applied to the HVAC system.
