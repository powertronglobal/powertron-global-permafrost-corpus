HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report
Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study
The purpose of this study is to verify the industry wide problem of 
efficiency loss in HVAC/R as projected by ASHRAE research and to 
quantify the amount of money wasted due to this loss. Many 
industry leading organizations including ASHRAE project that all 
HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age. 
Thermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in 
all HVAC/R equipment that operates as a vapor compression cycle 
associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal 
degradation is well documented by the HVAC/R industry and the 
original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal degradation 
prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which 
leads to excessive run-times and additional kWh consumption.
The CRAC systems in this study are representative of a great 
majority of the portfolio of equipment operated by Tech Company A. If thermal degradation is 
present in these systems it is present in the entire inventory of equipment. Energy waste can be calculated based 
on this equipment (portfolio representation) and then accurately extrapolated across the entire inventory of 
equipment.

Process
This report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of two CRAC systems that 
support the Tech Company A facility in [Texas Location], TX. 
Detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the two pilot CRAC systems 
before and after the installation of the ECM to determine the impact on the three key elements that greatly 
affect the HVAC/R portion of the power bill as they relate to the original design specifications:
 
 
1. The cooling capacity the CRAC systems produced after 10 years in service, before and after the 
 
    administration of the ECM. 
 
2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the systems can deliver as     
 
    reflected in the kW/ton measurement, before and after the administration of the ECM. 
 
3. The thermal dynamic ability of the systems to perform in relation to operational design, before and 
 
    after the administration of the ECM.
Methodology
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the IPMVP 
(International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted [Sustainability Director] of Major Technology Company; Raul 
Olvera of Facilities Services Provider; Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer].  
Notes
The equipment tested were two 22-ton (nominal) CRAC systems manufactured by Liebert.  Both the baseline and post 
measurements were taken in identical fashion with recently NIST calibrated devices.  M&V equipment details and 
certification sheets are available by request. The CFM in the baseline and post for both systems were identical for each system. 
[M&O Supervisor] of Facilities Services Provider and [Sustainability Director] of Major Technology Company witnessed and signed off on the collections of data in both the baseline and post 
periods. The boundary of the testing was at the CRAC units and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the 
performance calculations is very high.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the pilot CRAC systems to perform prior to 
the ECM being installed, as well as illustrate the amount of thermal degradation 
within the heat exchangers.
 
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor * 1.732/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
 
• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = CFM X 4.5 * 60 * Enthalpy Delta / 12,000 BTU 
Notes
Following a diagnostic examination to determine the operational condition of the CRAC systems was satisfactory, Baseline 
M&V data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. Approximately 400+ runtime hours after installation of the 
ECM, the M&V team returned to take Post M&V measurements in the identical fashion as in the baseline. The delta of 
these measurements and associated calculations show the amount of capacity restored.
The following baseline IPMVP data points were recorded on June 15, 2106. The two systems were then treated with 
PermaFrost NMR® on the same day and allowed to run normally until July 22, 2016 to ensure the patented surface science 
nanotechnology had ample time to seat into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All measurements were taken at 
similar incoming air temperatures however the outdoor air temperature in the post was 6 degrees F warmer (93 deg F vs. 99 
deg F). The manufacturer provided a computerized load selection chart to illustrate that for every degree higher in ambient 
dry bulb temperature the system would lose approximately .60% of capacity (please see Appendix A). The total loss of 
capacity per degree equated to 3.61% and then this percentage was added to each system's measured total capacity in the 
post. For CRAC #59 an additional .97 tons was added to the measured total calculated capacity and for CRAC #60  an 
additional .69 tons was added.
Normalization of input kW (amperage specifically) was also employed in order to account for the 6 degrees F higher 
ambient dry bulb temperature. Compressors account for 70% of the total amperage consumed which is also true with these 
systems (please see Appendix A). The following formula was used: Actual Measured Amps x (Actual Measured Amps x 
0.7 x % increase in Ambient DB Temp). For CRAC #59 the post-measured amperage of 46.2 was reduced to 44.1. For 
CRAC #60 the post-measured amperage of 47.5 was reduced to 45.4 amps. These new amperage numbers were entered into 
standard electrical formula of V x A x PF x 1.732/1000 in order to normalize system kW.

Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results 
CRAC #59 & #60 Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Major Technology Company has the problem of thermal degradation in its HVAC systems. The lower operating tonnage and COP 
ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. The 
degraded equipment performance is costing Major Technology Company significant money and wasting energy. The pilot CRAC 
systems are using significantly more energy to operate than when it was new ten years earlier. 
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of both CRAC systems combined 
in the baseline and post testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. Individual system 
results are outlined later in this report.
The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 7.1 operating tons and an 
average improvement of 22% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate 
the systems throughout the year.

Recovered Wasted Energy with ECM – CRAC #59 & #60
The kW/ton is the standard Unit Cost in the 
HVAC/R industry. It is the HVAC industry’s 
standard of determining how much energy is 
required to create 1 ton of cooling (i.e., conditioned 
air). When you reduce your unit cost of cooling you 
are saving regardless of how much cooling is 
required. 
The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration the ECM created in the treated systems 
(combined). The average cost to operate these 
systems before it was treated with PermaFrost 
NMR®,  as calculated in kW/ton,  was 1.50.
The specific cost to operate these CRAC systems after 
it was treated with PermaFrost NMR®,  as calculated 
in kW/ton, is now 1.24. Individual results can be 
found later in this report.

Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the Major Technology Company CRAC systems.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 40.7 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: 1.50 kW/ton * 47.8 tons = 71.7 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 71.7 kW * 6045 Annual Operating Hrs = 433,427 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 433,427 kWh * $.054 = $23,405
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: 1.24 kW/ton * 47.8 tons = 59.3 kW
Annual kWh Post: 59.3 kW * 6045 hours = 358,469 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 358,469 kWh * $.054 = $19,357
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $23,405 - $19,357 = $4,048
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $4,048 / 12 = $337
Initial Payback Period (IPP)
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot systems: $5,500
Estimated IPP: $5,500 / $337 = 16.3 months
Annual Rate of Return = 73.6%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 368%
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for 
Major Technology Company for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post 
Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the CRAC systems were when operating at the 
original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the 
revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed. This 
regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours or load the CRACs 
will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the set points with 
increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
