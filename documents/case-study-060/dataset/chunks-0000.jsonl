Many \nindustry leading organizations including ASHRAE project that all \nHVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age. \nThermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in \nall HVAC/R equipment that operates as a vapor compression cycle \nassociated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal \ndegradation is well documented by the HVAC/R industry and the \noriginal equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal degradation \nprevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which \nleads to excessive run-times and additional kWh consumption.\nThe CRAC systems in this study are representative of a great \nmajority of the portfolio of equipment operated by Tech Company A. If thermal degradation is \npresent in these systems it is present in the entire inventory of equipment. Energy waste can be calculated based \non this equipment (portfolio representation) and then accurately extrapolated across the entire inventory of \nequipment.\n®\nThis report is provided to Tech Company A.

The report is not to be distributed to any third party without written consent of Powertron Global®, LLC.\n\n\n\n   2 \nProcess\nThis report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of two CRAC systems that \nsupport the Tech Company A facility in [Texas Location], TX. \nDetailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the two pilot CRAC systems \nbefore and after the installation of the ECM to determine the impact on the three key elements that greatly \naffect the HVAC/R portion of the power bill as they relate to the original design specifications:\n \n \n1. The cooling capacity the CRAC systems produced after 10 years in service, before and after the \n \n    administration of the ECM. \n \n2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the systems can deliver as     \n \n    reflected in the kW/ton measurement, before and after the administration of the ECM. \n \n3. The thermal dynamic ability of the systems to perform in relation to operational design, before and \n \n    after the administration of the ECM.\nMethodology\nThe measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the IPMVP \n(International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted [Sustainability Director] of Major Technology Company; Raul \nOlvera of Facilities Services Provider; Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer].  \nNotes\nThe equipment tested were two 22-ton (nominal) CRAC systems manufactured by Liebert.  Both the baseline and post \nmeasurements were taken in identical fashion with recently NIST calibrated devices.  M&V equipment details and \ncertification sheets are available by request. The CFM in the baseline and post for both systems were identical for each system. \n[M&O Supervisor] of Facilities Services Provider and [Sustainability Director] of Major Technology Company witnessed and signed off on the collections of data in both the baseline and post \nperiods. The boundary of the testing was at the CRAC units and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the \nperformance calculations is very high.\n®\nThis report is provided to Tech Company A.

The report is not to be distributed to any third party without written consent of Powertron Global®, LLC.\n\n\n\n3\nEnergy Conservation Method (ECM)\nThe content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the pilot CRAC systems to perform prior to \nthe ECM being installed, as well as illustrate the amount of thermal degradation \nwithin the heat exchangers.\n \nThe following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. \nThe results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:\n \n• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor * 1.732/1000 (for 3-Phase) \n \n• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage \n \n• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)\n \n• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = CFM X 4.5 * 60 * Enthalpy Delta / 12,000 BTU \nNotes\nFollowing a diagnostic examination to determine the operational condition of the CRAC systems was satisfactory, Baseline \nM&V data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. Approximately 400+ runtime hours after installation of the \nECM, the M&V team returned to take Post M&V measurements in the identical fashion as in the baseline. The delta of \nthese measurements and associated calculations show the amount of capacity restored.\nThe following baseline IPMVP data points were recorded on June 15, 2106. The two systems were then treated with \nPermaFrost NMR® on the same day and allowed to run normally until July 22, 2016 to ensure the patented surface science \nnanotechnology had ample time to seat into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All measurements were taken at \nsimilar incoming air temperatures however the outdoor air temperature in the post was 6 degrees F warmer (93 deg F vs. 99 \ndeg F). The manufacturer provided a computerized load selection chart to illustrate that for every degree higher in ambient \ndry bulb temperature the system would lose approximately .60% of capacity (please see Appendix A). The total loss of \ncapacity per degree equated to 3.61% and then this percentage was added to each system's measured total capacity in the \npost. For CRAC #59 an additional .97 tons was added to the measured total calculated capacity and for CRAC #60  an \nadditional .69 tons was added.\nNormalization of input kW (amperage specifically) was also employed in order to account for the 6 degrees F higher \nambient dry bulb temperature. Compressors account for 70% of the total amperage consumed which is also true with these \nsystems (please see Appendix A). The following formula was used: Actual Measured Amps x (Actual Measured Amps x \n0.7 x % increase in Ambient DB Temp). For CRAC #59 the post-measured amperage of 46.2 was reduced to 44.1. For \nCRAC #60 the post-measured amperage of 47.5 was reduced to 45.4 amps. These new amperage numbers were entered into \nstandard electrical formula of V x A x PF x 1.732/1000 in order to normalize system kW.\n®\nThis report is provided to Tech Company A.

This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post \nAnalysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the CRAC systems were when operating at the \noriginal energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the \nrevised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed. This \nregression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours or load the CRACs \nwill now operate due to the restored capacity.
