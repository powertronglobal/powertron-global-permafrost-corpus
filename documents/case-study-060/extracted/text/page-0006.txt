Recovered Wasted Energy with ECM – CRAC #59 & #60
The kW/ton is the standard Unit Cost in the 
HVAC/R industry. It is the HVAC industry’s 
standard of determining how much energy is 
required to create 1 ton of cooling (i.e., conditioned 
air). When you reduce your unit cost of cooling you 
are saving regardless of how much cooling is 
required. 
The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration the ECM created in the treated systems 
(combined). The average cost to operate these 
systems before it was treated with PermaFrost 
NMR®,  as calculated in kW/ton,  was 1.50.
The specific cost to operate these CRAC systems after 
it was treated with PermaFrost NMR®,  as calculated 
in kW/ton, is now 1.24. Individual results can be 
found later in this report.
