Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the Major Technology Company CRAC systems.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 40.7 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: 1.50 kW/ton * 47.8 tons = 71.7 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 71.7 kW * 6045 Annual Operating Hrs = 433,427 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 433,427 kWh * $.054 = $23,405
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: 1.24 kW/ton * 47.8 tons = 59.3 kW
Annual kWh Post: 59.3 kW * 6045 hours = 358,469 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 358,469 kWh * $.054 = $19,357
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $23,405 - $19,357 = $4,048
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $4,048 / 12 = $337
Initial Payback Period (IPP)
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot systems: $5,500
Estimated IPP: $5,500 / $337 = 16.3 months
Annual Rate of Return = 73.6%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 368%
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for 
Major Technology Company for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post 
Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the CRAC systems were when operating at the 
original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the 
revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed. This 
regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours or load the CRACs 
will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the set points with 
increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
