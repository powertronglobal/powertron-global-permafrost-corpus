Energy Performance Report
Major Global Bank - Property Management Company
May 30, 2013 
Executive Summary
         This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure 
(ECM) PermaFrost NMR® in chiller for Major Global Bank /Property Management Company building located in Irving, TX. Detailed 
forensic performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on a 380-ton McQuay 
water-cooled chiller unit using R-134A refrigerant. Powertron Global® would like to thank the local team 
personnel of Property Management Company [Chief Engineer], Chief Engineer, and [Assistant Chief Engineer], assistant Chief Engineer, 
at the Las Collinas facility for assisting and overseeing the completion of this project for Major Global Bank. 
Immediately following the baseline testing, the unit were treated with the proper amount and type of 
PermaFrost NMR® product formulated for R-134A refrigerant type chiller systems. Since there were no 
other ECM’s going on during this pilot project, the improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained 
directly at the units is solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. This greater operational efficiency 
is due to the restoration of the heat transfer ability of the cooler and condenser tubes.
Following treatment with PermaFrost NMR®, while operating at 100% load, the chiller showed a significant 
reduction in kW/Ton of 9.6% and a 11% improvement in COP. As individual measurements this chiller 
showed a 3.3% reduction in kW and a 3.7% reduction in Amps while at the same time while producing an 
additional 23 tons. 
It is also important to note that PermaFrost NMR® will often reclaim energy robbing oil that is trapped  in 
the lower refrigerant sector of the cooler (evaporator) of chillers.  [Assistant Chief Engineer], the plant operator and 
assistant chief engineer with Property Management Company, had noticed after 4-5 days of the application of PermaFrost NMR® the oil 
indicating site glass was demonstrating signs of filling. It seemed that eventually the oil level would surpass 
the manufacturers operating level. Mr. [Senior Energy Engineer] of Powertron Global® was notified of this during his 
return for the post results. A request was made of [Assistant Chief Engineer] to wait one additional week before removing 
this excess oil to ensure PermaFrost NMR® arrived at the period of gestation so to assure complete 
adsorption into the interior surfaces of the chiller components.  [Assistant Chief Engineer] had informed Powertron Global®

that TD Services (a mechanical contracting service corporation) removed approximately 3 gallons of 
reclaimed oil in order to return the level of oil to proper operating levels. This action provides another level 
of justification to the claims of this technology and the results of such an application.
 
The result of the average ECM improvements is an ROI to Major Global Bank of just 17.6 months based on the runtime 
information and kW costs for this location. The tables of data and financial calculations are available for 
review at the end of this report.
Product Brief
         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure 
(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, 
one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any 
type of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and 
equipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); 
chilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia 
refrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The 
equipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal 
(single and multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and 
improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point temperatures in a more 
rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from the 
enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW hours used, 
less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced carbon footprint for Major Global Bank.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) was utilized in the 
development of this report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, 
Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization 
(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation 
methods and products.
There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They 
are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Retrofit Isolation 
(Option B) is defined as: All parameter measurement with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as 
the single source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the 
energy conservation method affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the 
baseline data.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term 
measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by 
short-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using 
measurements of proxies of energy use. 
The final computation follows the formula:

Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content of the following report will demonstrate the effects of PermaFrost NMR®’s ability to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces. 
It was determined with Major Global Bank to treat a water-cooled chiller at the Irving, TX location. A diagnostic 
examination of the pilot equipment is implemented to determine if the unit’s operational conditions are 
satisfactory. Baseline measurements will be recorded and then the proper amount and type of PermaFrost 
NMR® will be injected. The product will be allowed 4 weeks to seat itself into the metal surfaces before post 
measurements were taken to establish the efficiency gains. The chiller was run at 100% load factor.
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP International Performance Measurement and 
Verification Protocol as the M&V plan. Powertron Global’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer Edward R. 
[Senior Energy Engineer] performed the final calculations and measurements. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
kW = Volts * Amps * .1.47 (.85 x 1.732)/1000 (for 3 phase)
 
Actual GPM = GPM2 = GPM * Measured Pressure Drop (ft) / by Design Pressure Drop (ft) (squared)
 
Operating Tons / Hour  = (GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T) / 12,000 BTU
 
kW/Ton = Actual kW / Actual Tonnage
 
COP = (12 / kW per ton / 3.412)

Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to calculate an accurate payback for 
Major Global Bank for implementing this ECM. First, the annual cost is calculated to run the chiller at baseline levels for 
2,688 hours per year.
kW Baseline        .73 kW/ton * 307 tons = 224.1kW
Annual kWh Baseline        224.1kW * 2,688 hours = 602,381 kWh
Annual Cost Baseline        602,381 kWh * .06 cents = $36,143
Regression Analysis for the restored capacity of the chiller provided by PermaFrost NMR®:
Adjusted Baseline Tonnage        330 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline        .73 kW/ton * 330 tons = 240.9 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh        240.9 * 2,688 Annual Operating hrs = 647,539 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline        647,539 kWh * $.06 = $38,852
The cost to run the chiller at 2,688 hours per year at 330 tons utilizing original baseline eﬃciency is calculated
at $38,852 per year.
The cost of running the chiller at 330 tons utilizing the improved post installation eﬃciency:
kW E.R.P.        .66 kW/ton * 330 tons = 217.8 kW
Annual kWh E.R.P.        217.8 kW * 2,688 hours = 585,446 kWh
Annual Cost E.R.P.        585,446 kWh * .06 cents = $35,127
Annual Savings        $38,852- $35,127 = $3,725
Monthly Savings        $3,725/ 12 = $310
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed for Major Global Bank is $5,462 / $310 = 17.6 months payback
 
ROI = 17.6 months
