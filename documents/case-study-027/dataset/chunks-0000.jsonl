Detailed \nforensic performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on a 380-ton McQuay \nwater-cooled chiller unit using R-134A refrigerant. Powertron Global® would like to thank the local team \npersonnel of Property Management Company [Chief Engineer], Chief Engineer, and [Assistant Chief Engineer], assistant Chief Engineer, \nat the Las Collinas facility for assisting and overseeing the completion of this project for Major Global Bank. \nImmediately following the baseline testing, the unit were treated with the proper amount and type of \nPermaFrost NMR® product formulated for R-134A refrigerant type chiller systems. Since there were no \nother ECM’s going on during this pilot project, the improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained \ndirectly at the units is solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. This greater operational efficiency \nis due to the restoration of the heat transfer ability of the cooler and condenser tubes.\nFollowing treatment with PermaFrost NMR®, while operating at 100% load, the chiller showed a significant \nreduction in kW/Ton of 9.6% and a 11% improvement in COP. As individual measurements this chiller \nshowed a 3.3% reduction in kW and a 3.7% reduction in Amps while at the same time while producing an \nadditional 23 tons. \nIt is also important to note that PermaFrost NMR® will often reclaim energy robbing oil that is trapped  in \nthe lower refrigerant sector of the cooler (evaporator) of chillers.  [Assistant Chief Engineer], the plant operator and \nassistant chief engineer with Property Management Company, had noticed after 4-5 days of the application of PermaFrost NMR® the oil \nindicating site glass was demonstrating signs of filling. It seemed that eventually the oil level would surpass \nthe manufacturers operating level. Mr. [Senior Energy Engineer] of Powertron Global® was notified of this during his \nreturn for the post results. A request was made of [Assistant Chief Engineer] to wait one additional week before removing \nthis excess oil to ensure PermaFrost NMR® arrived at the period of gestation so to assure complete \nadsorption into the interior surfaces of the chiller components.  [Assistant Chief Engineer] had informed Powertron Global® \nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 736, "chars": 3306, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_032_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:f98c720eb72822aa11018c24cb3366d96e03cf3a726bf4438250ddf0a95d38ef"}

This action provides another level \nof justification to the claims of this technology and the results of such an application.\n \nThe result of the average ECM improvements is an ROI to Major Global Bank of just 17.6 months based on the runtime \ninformation and kW costs for this location. The tables of data and financial calculations are available for \nreview at the end of this report.\nProduct Brief\n         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure \n(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any \ntype of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and \nequipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); \nchilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia \nrefrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The \nequipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal \n(single and multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and \nimproved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point temperatures in a more \nrapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from the \nenhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW hours used, \nless amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced carbon footprint for Major Global Bank.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 535, "chars": 2661, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_032_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_032_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:7a9d2d2a1cabdf7b9a7f94b97926f0f3a9dda38296ba64ae3bb037a0ce4c2eec"}

The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, \nRefrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization \n(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation \nmethods and products.\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Retrofit Isolation \n(Option B) is defined as: All parameter measurement with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as \nthe single source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the \nenergy conservation method affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the \nbaseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using \nmeasurements of proxies of energy use. \nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+ - Routine adjustments / + - Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 450, "chars": 2242, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_032_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_032_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:1b483826abc2669ff93cf71efb0d3f03ff28823571be2e35913d38867f8d1ee5"}
