Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content of the following report will demonstrate the effects of PermaFrost NMR®’s ability to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces. 
It was determined with Major Global Bank to treat a water-cooled chiller at the Irving, TX location. A diagnostic 
examination of the pilot equipment is implemented to determine if the unit’s operational conditions are 
satisfactory. Baseline measurements will be recorded and then the proper amount and type of PermaFrost 
NMR® will be injected. The product will be allowed 4 weeks to seat itself into the metal surfaces before post 
measurements were taken to establish the efficiency gains. The chiller was run at 100% load factor.
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP International Performance Measurement and 
Verification Protocol as the M&V plan. Powertron Global’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer Edward R. 
[Senior Energy Engineer] performed the final calculations and measurements. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
kW = Volts * Amps * .1.47 (.85 x 1.732)/1000 (for 3 phase)
 
Actual GPM = GPM2 = GPM * Measured Pressure Drop (ft) / by Design Pressure Drop (ft) (squared)
 
Operating Tons / Hour  = (GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T) / 12,000 BTU
 
kW/Ton = Actual kW / Actual Tonnage
 
COP = (12 / kW per ton / 3.412)
