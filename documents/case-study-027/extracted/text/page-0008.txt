Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to calculate an accurate payback for 
Major Global Bank for implementing this ECM. First, the annual cost is calculated to run the chiller at baseline levels for 
2,688 hours per year.
kW Baseline        .73 kW/ton * 307 tons = 224.1kW
Annual kWh Baseline        224.1kW * 2,688 hours = 602,381 kWh
Annual Cost Baseline        602,381 kWh * .06 cents = $36,143
Regression Analysis for the restored capacity of the chiller provided by PermaFrost NMR®:
Adjusted Baseline Tonnage        330 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline        .73 kW/ton * 330 tons = 240.9 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh        240.9 * 2,688 Annual Operating hrs = 647,539 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline        647,539 kWh * $.06 = $38,852
The cost to run the chiller at 2,688 hours per year at 330 tons utilizing original baseline eﬃciency is calculated
at $38,852 per year.
The cost of running the chiller at 330 tons utilizing the improved post installation eﬃciency:
kW E.R.P.        .66 kW/ton * 330 tons = 217.8 kW
Annual kWh E.R.P.        217.8 kW * 2,688 hours = 585,446 kWh
Annual Cost E.R.P.        585,446 kWh * .06 cents = $35,127
Annual Savings        $38,852- $35,127 = $3,725
Monthly Savings        $3,725/ 12 = $310
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed for Major Global Bank is $5,462 / $310 = 17.6 months payback
 
ROI = 17.6 months
