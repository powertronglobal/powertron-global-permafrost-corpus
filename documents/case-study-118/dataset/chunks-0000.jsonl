A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any \ntype of system in which it is installed – DX (direct expansion air and chilled water systems), Chillers \n(screw, reciprocating, scroll and centrifugal), heat pumps, ice making equipment.  Specialized \napplications include computer room cooling and dehumidification systems, chiller plants (water and ice \nproduction applications), domestic and industrial refrigeration (ammonia low and ultra low \ntemperature), air-cooled single application water chillers and split and package rooftop HVAC \nequipment.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity, and \nimproved refrigerant velocity – all of which allows a system to achieve set point temperatures in a more \nrapid fashion that reduces system loading and operating periods.  The indirect benefits resulting from \nthe enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW \nhours used, less amp draw at the compressor, less metallic wear and longer overall equipment life.\nEnergy Science Division\nOIL BUILD-UP\nOIL REMOVED\nBEFORE TREATMENT\nAFTER TREATMENT\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\nUnit #1\n54-ton Carrier Water Cooled DX\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 596, "chars": 2740, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_114_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:61d3bd91a48fa527aa304ac9de4b96a9035f59aadfce734fd420dc313eda7ef1"}

The facility houses the \nTraffic Police Department for the City of New York.  Unit #1 is owned and maintained by Commercial Real Estate Company located \nin New York, NY.  Louis Rojo, Commercial Real Estate Company Facility Manager for this location, oversaw the trial. \nThe improved/restored efficiency on the unit directly attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was \nsubstantial.  The unit now provides cooler supply air with greater efficiency due to the restoration of the \nheat transfer capacity of the evaporator and condenser coils and increased the available useful tonnage. \nAll three compressors were operating within design/operating standards and very similar to one another \nand all outside air dampers were closed both pre and post.\nThe overall system efficiency improved by 17.8% and the EER improved by 42.8%.  There was an increase in \ncoil capacity of 96,525 in Btuh which equates to gaining 8-tons of capacity or 17.8%.  There is also a \nreduction of 18% in total power and watts per ton which is another measurable way to view the \nthermodynamic enhancement of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The tables of data and financial calculations \nare available for review at the end of this report.  The result of these combined ECM improvements is an \nROI to Commercial Real Estate Company of 23.9 months.\nMeasurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol\nThe International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocols (IPMVP) are used to develop this \nreport.
