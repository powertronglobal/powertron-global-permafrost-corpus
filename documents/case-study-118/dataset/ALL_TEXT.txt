Performance Report on PermaFrost NMR® ECM
8th Fl, Commercial Real Estate Company Bldg at [Commercial Address], NYC
July 27, 2012
Product Brief
         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface science Energy Control Measure 
(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) technology as its core agent.  A sustainable, 
one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any 
type of system in which it is installed – DX (direct expansion air and chilled water systems), Chillers 
(screw, reciprocating, scroll and centrifugal), heat pumps, ice making equipment.  Specialized 
applications include computer room cooling and dehumidification systems, chiller plants (water and ice 
production applications), domestic and industrial refrigeration (ammonia low and ultra low 
temperature), air-cooled single application water chillers and split and package rooftop HVAC 
equipment.
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity, and 
improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allows a system to achieve set point temperatures in a more 
rapid fashion that reduces system loading and operating periods.  The indirect benefits resulting from 
the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW 
hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, less metallic wear and longer overall equipment life.

Executive Summary
This report contains specific information regarding the installation of PermaFrost NMR® in the 54-ton 
Carrier Water Cooled DX Unit #1 at the Commercial Real Estate Company Bldg at [Commercial Address], NYC.  The facility houses the 
Traffic Police Department for the City of New York.  Unit #1 is owned and maintained by Commercial Real Estate Company located 
in New York, NY.  Louis Rojo, Commercial Real Estate Company Facility Manager for this location, oversaw the trial. 
The improved/restored efficiency on the unit directly attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was 
substantial.  The unit now provides cooler supply air with greater efficiency due to the restoration of the 
heat transfer capacity of the evaporator and condenser coils and increased the available useful tonnage. 
All three compressors were operating within design/operating standards and very similar to one another 
and all outside air dampers were closed both pre and post.
The overall system efficiency improved by 17.8% and the EER improved by 42.8%.  There was an increase in 
coil capacity of 96,525 in Btuh which equates to gaining 8-tons of capacity or 17.8%.  There is also a 
reduction of 18% in total power and watts per ton which is another measurable way to view the 
thermodynamic enhancement of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The tables of data and financial calculations 
are available for review at the end of this report.  The result of these combined ECM improvements is an 
ROI to Commercial Real Estate Company of 23.9 months.
Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocols (IPMVP) are used to develop this 
report.  The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and 
Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the 
IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and 
products.

There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize.  They 
are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.  Option B is 
defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (Permafrost NMR®) as the single 
source of measurement.  Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM 
affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term 
measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by 
short-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using 
measurements of proxies of energy use. 
The final computation follows the formula:
Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces.
 
Commercial Real Estate Company made the decision to treat this unit as it was one of two supporting the 8th floor.  Both units were 
treated and tested.  A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the 
unit’s operational conditions were satisfactory.  Baseline measurements were recorded and then the proper 
amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected.  The product was then allowed four (4) weeks to seat 
itself into the metal surfaces before post measurements were taken to establish the efficiency gains. 
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP International Performance Measurement and 
Verification Protocol as the M&V plan. The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global’s Senior 
Energy Engineer [Senior Energy Engineer] ME/CEM/CMC/CMVP.

Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to determine a very accurate ROI for 
Commercial Real Estate Company for implementing this ECM:
Baseline kWh = (59,155 NTW / 1,000) * 1,500 Annual Operating Hrs = 88,733 kWh
Baseline Cost To Run = 88,733 kWh * $.18 = $15,972
Regression Analysis is then used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Unit #1
Adjusted Base Tonnage = 53.21 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP) 
Adjusted Total Watts = 1,310 WPT * 53.21 tons = 69,705 W
Adjusted Base kWh = (69,705 W/1,000) * 1,500 Annual Operating Hrs = 104,558 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM = 104,558 kWh * $.18 = $18,820
Post ECM kWh = (57,183 W / 1,000) * 1,500 Annual Operating Hrs = 85,775 kWh
Cost to Run After ECM = 85,775 kWh * $.18 = $15,440
Cost Savings per Month = ($18,820 - $15,440) / 12 = $282
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed @ $6,750 / $282 = 23.9 months
 
ROI = 23.9 months

Executive Summary
This report contains specific information regarding the installation of PermaFrost NMR® in the 54-ton 
Carrier Water Cooled DX Unit #2 at the Commercial Real Estate Company Bldg at [Commercial Address], NYC.  The facility houses the 
Traffic Police Department for the City of New York.  Unit #2 is owned and maintained by Commercial Real Estate Company located 
in New York, NY.  Louis Rojo, Commercial Real Estate Company Facility Manager for this location, oversaw the trial. 
The improved/restored efficiency on the unit directly attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was 
substantial.  The unit now provides cooler supply air with greater efficiency due to the restoration of the 
heat transfer capacity of the evaporator and condenser coils and increased the available useful tonnage. 
During the testing we found that compressor #3 is operating slightly outside of design/operating standards 
of compressors #1 and #2.  The On-site mechanical contractor adjusted refrigerant charge prior to readings 
being taken but there was no change to the performance of the compressor.  Compressors #1 and #2 had 
slightly low evaporator pressure and temperature but still within operating range for the system.  Post 
readings after the ECM still show compressor #3 is not performing as well as the others.
The overall system efficiency improved by 33.3% and the EER improved by 46.5%.  There was an increase in 
coil capacity of 120,825 in Btuh which equates to gaining 10.1-tons of capacity or 26.6%.  There is also a 
reduction of 31.7% in total power and watts per ton which is another measurable way to view the 
thermodynamic enhancement of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The tables of data and financial calculations 
are available for review at the end of this report.  The result of these combined ECM improvements is an 
ROI to Commercial Real Estate Company of 14.2 months.
