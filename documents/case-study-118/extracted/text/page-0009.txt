Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to determine a very accurate ROI for 
Commercial Real Estate Company for implementing this ECM:
Baseline kWh = (59,155 NTW / 1,000) * 1,500 Annual Operating Hrs = 88,733 kWh
Baseline Cost To Run = 88,733 kWh * $.18 = $15,972
Regression Analysis is then used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Unit #1
Adjusted Base Tonnage = 53.21 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP) 
Adjusted Total Watts = 1,310 WPT * 53.21 tons = 69,705 W
Adjusted Base kWh = (69,705 W/1,000) * 1,500 Annual Operating Hrs = 104,558 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM = 104,558 kWh * $.18 = $18,820
Post ECM kWh = (57,183 W / 1,000) * 1,500 Annual Operating Hrs = 85,775 kWh
Cost to Run After ECM = 85,775 kWh * $.18 = $15,440
Cost Savings per Month = ($18,820 - $15,440) / 12 = $282
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed @ $6,750 / $282 = 23.9 months
 
ROI = 23.9 months
