Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to determine a very accurate ROI for 
Commercial Real Estate Company for implementing this ECM:
Baseline kWh = (52,576 TW / 1,000) * 1,500 Annual Operating Hrs = 78,864 kWh
Baseline Cost To Run = 78,864 kWh * $.18 = $14,196
Regression Analysis is then used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Unit #2
Adjusted Base Tonnage = 47.98 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP) 
Adjusted Total Watts = 1,387 WPT * 47.98 tons = 66,548 W
Adjusted Base kWh = (66,548 W/1,000) * 1,500 Annual Operating Hrs = 99,822 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM = 99,822 kWh * $.18 = $17,968
Post ECM kWh = (45,437 W / 1,000) * 1,500 Annual Operating Hrs = 68,156 kWh
Cost to Run After ECM = 68,156 kWh * $.18 = $12,268
Cost Savings per Month = ($17,968 - $12,268) / 12 = $475
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed @ $6,750 / $475 = 14.2
 
ROI = 14.2 months
