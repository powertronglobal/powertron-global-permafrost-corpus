I would say it's slightly improved 1-2 degrees.\"\nRegards,\n[HVAC Work Leader]\n     In conclusion, the results of the test showed substantial improvement in the units \ntested that matched the numerous other tests run on PermaFrost™.", "tokens": 572, "chars": 2381, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "", "content_hash": "sha256:2bf8ac6b33714cbce5bbb7bdd65cb8e95d2f422befd3cfed65d5f1cb46423c78"}
