Per [HVAC Work Leader]: 
“We have seen the most significant improvement in a 5 ton unit that handles 4 offices.  
PermaFrost™ was added on 8/7/08 and we started with a 12 degree delta T.
                On 8/12/08 the delta T. had increased to 16 degrees.
                On 8/19/08 the delta T. had increased to 17 degrees.
                On 8/25/08 the delta T. had increased to 19 degrees.
The other location we injected the permafrost in is a gym office very close to double 
doors that are used frequently. I would say it's slightly improved 1-2 degrees.”

     In conclusion, the results of the test showed substantial improvement in the units 
tested that matched the numerous other tests run on PermaFrost™.
