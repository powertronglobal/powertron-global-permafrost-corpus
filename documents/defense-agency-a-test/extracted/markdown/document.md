Performed by [HVAC Work Leader],
Defense Agency A 
Selected 5 ton Spilt systems 
Richmond, Virginia
     Methodology
The methodology was to take baseline readings of 
air supply and air return temperatures to 
determine a baseline cooling performance and 
then repeat after the PermaFrost™ treatment for 
several weeks to measure efficiency 
improvements. 
Per [HVAC Work Leader]:
“I used a "FLUKE 16" multi-meter with temp 
sensor and took meticulous supply and return 
temps and then calculated the Delta T.”
     Results
Building #1 ( 5 ton split system cooling 4 offices) 
The building was controlled in terms of testing 
protocols and represented a good test site.
The unit showed over 30% improvement in Delta 
T (cooling performance).
Building # 2 Gymnasium with offices attached ( 5 
ton split system cooling offices)  This building was 
outside the normal testing protocols due to open 
continuously or frequently. 
The unit showed between 10-15% improvement in 
Delta T (cooling performance) but accurate results 
are not possible due to the uncontrolled 
environment.
Report Date: November 17, 2008
The aim of this report is to examine the effects 
of PermaFrost in some of Defense Agency A's common
equipment to provide support for Defense Agency A
efficiency initiatives.

Per [HVAC Work Leader]: 
“We have seen the most significant improvement in a 5 ton unit that handles 4 offices.  
PermaFrost™ was added on 8/7/08 and we started with a 12 degree delta T.
                On 8/12/08 the delta T. had increased to 16 degrees.
                On 8/19/08 the delta T. had increased to 17 degrees.
                On 8/25/08 the delta T. had increased to 19 degrees.
The other location we injected the permafrost in is a gym office very close to double 
doors that are used frequently. I would say it's slightly improved 1-2 degrees.”

     In conclusion, the results of the test showed substantial improvement in the units 
tested that matched the numerous other tests run on PermaFrost™.
