HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report
Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study
The purpose of this study is to verify the industry wide problem of efficiency loss in HVAC/R as projected by 
ASHRAE research and to quantify the amount of money wasted due to this loss. Many industry leading 
organizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they 
age. Thermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVAC/R equipment that operates 
as a vapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is 
well documented by the HVAC/R industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal 
degradation prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times 
and additional kWh consumption.
The chillers in this study are representative of Major Global Bank's data center portfolio HVAC/R equipment. If thermal 
degradation is present in this chiller plant, it is present in the the entire inventory of equipment. Energy waster 
can be calculated based on this equipment and then extrapolated across the entire portfolio.
Process
This report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of six (6) chillers that 
support the Major Global Bank Southwest Data Center in [Texas Location].
Detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on each chiller before and after the 
installation of the ECM to determine the impact on the three key elements:
1. The cooling capacity that each chiller produces after 9 years in service, before and after the
administration of the ECM.
2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons each chiller can delivers as
reflected in the kW/ton measurement, before and after the administration of the ECM.
3. The thermal dynamic ability of each chiller to perform in relation to operational design, before and
after the administration of the ECM.

Methodology
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the 
IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted [Client Representative], 
Sr. Chief Engineer and Powertron Global’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer].  
Notes 
The equipment tested were six (6) water-cooled chillers manufactured by HVAC Equipment Manufacturer. Both baseline and post measurements 
were taken in the identical manner.
The flow rate through the evaporator was matched in the baseline and post. The condenser water entering the chiller in the 
baseline and post were normalized. According to the manufacturer, for each degree different in the post versus the 
baseline, the capacity was either increased or decreased .25% per degree.
The boundary of the testing was at each chiller therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance calculations is high.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the treated chillers to perform prior to 
the ECM being installed, as well as illustrate the thermal degradation that naturally occurs in heat exchangers over time.
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor * √3/1000 (for 3-Phase)
• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU
Notes 
Following a diagnostic examination to determine the operational condition of the chillers was satisfactory, baseline M&V 
data was collected and recorded.  500+ runtime hours after installation of the ECM, we returned on very similar weather 
days to assure compliant weather conditions as compared to the Baseline for the purpose of obtaining post M&V 
measurements as was performed in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements and associated calculations demonstrate 
the amount of thermal capacity recovery.
The flow of the evaporator and condenser were measured using NIST calibrated instruments (National Institutes of 
Standards and Technology) for the verification of accurate GPM measurement. 
The remaining measurements were obtained locally from the chiller control panel. The chillers were then treated with 
PermaFrost NMR® on the same day and allowed to run normally to ensure the patented surface science nanotechnology 
had ample time to become assimilated into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All critical measurements were 
taken at similar incoming condenser water temperatures as well as outdoor air temperatures however routine adjustments 
to normalize the capacity due to warmer or cooler entering condenser temperatures were applied as per the IPMVP 
protocol.

Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results 
Chiller Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Major Global Bank has the problem of thermal degradation in its Chiller systems. The lower operating tonnage and COP 
ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. The 
degraded equipment performance is costing Major Global Bank Properties significant money and wasting energy. The treated 
chillers were using significantly more energy to operate than when they were new. 
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the chillers in the baseline and 
post testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. 
The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 785 operating tons and an average 
improvement of 23.5% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the 
chiller throughout the year.

Recovered Wasted Energy with ECM - Chiller 
The chart below illustrates the performance restoration the ECM created in the treated chillers. The average 
cost to operate these chillers before they were treated with PermaFrost NMR® as calculated in kW/ton was 
0.71.
The specific cost to operate these chillers after they 
were treated with PermaFrost NMR® as calculated 
in kW/ton is currently 0.56.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured 
in-situ was expected when compared to the 
ASHRAE loss of performance efficiency and cost to 
operate estimate for an average 9 year old chillers 
utilizing R -123 refrigerant. The post results are 
also in line with the average improvement savings 
shown over more than 130,000 installations 
globally.

Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the six (6) Major Global Bank Southwest Data Center chillers combined.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 3311 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: .71 kW/ton * 4,096 tons = 2,908.2 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 2,908.2 kW * 2,193 Annual Operating Hrs = 6,377,683 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 6,377,683 kWh * $.085 = $542,103
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: .56 kW/ton * 4,096 tons = 2,293.8 kW
Annual kWh Post: 2,293.8 kW * 2,193 hours = 5,030,303 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 5,030,303 kWh * .085 cents = $427,576
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $542,103 - $427,576 = $114,527
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $114,527 / 12 = $9,544
Return On Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in all six chillers: $37,003
Estimated Payback Period for Major Global Bank on the chillers: $37,003 / $9,544 = 4 months
Annual Rate of Return = 309.5%
Return on Investment Over 10 Years = 3095% 
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period 
for Major Global Bank for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true 
energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This restored capacity reduces the annual kWh expended 
in the Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller was when operating at the 
original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the 
revised cost to run the chiller at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed. This 
regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours or load the 
chillers will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the chiller to reach the internal 
building set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
