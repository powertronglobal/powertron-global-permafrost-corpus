Many industry leading \norganizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they \nage. Thermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVAC/R equipment that operates \nas a vapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is \nwell documented by the HVAC/R industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal \ndegradation prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times \nand additional kWh consumption.\nThe chillers in this study are representative of Major Global Bank's data center portfolio HVAC/R equipment. If thermal \ndegradation is present in this chiller plant, it is present in the the entire inventory of equipment. Energy waster \ncan be calculated based on this equipment and then extrapolated across the entire portfolio.\nProcess\nThis report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of six (6) chillers that \nsupport the Major Global Bank Southwest Data Center in [Texas Location].\nDetailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on each chiller before and after the \ninstallation of the ECM to determine the impact on the three key elements:\n1. The cooling capacity that each chiller produces after 9 years in service, before and after the\nadministration of the ECM.\n2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons each chiller can delivers as\nreflected in the kW/ton measurement, before and after the administration of the ECM.\n3. The thermal dynamic ability of each chiller to perform in relation to operational design, before and\nafter the administration of the ECM.\nThis report is provided to Major Global Bank.

The team consisted [Client Representative], \nSr. Chief Engineer and Powertron Global’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer].  \nNotes \nThe equipment tested were six (6) water-cooled chillers manufactured by HVAC Equipment Manufacturer. Both baseline and post measurements \nwere taken in the identical manner.\nThe flow rate through the evaporator was matched in the baseline and post. The condenser water entering the chiller in the \nbaseline and post were normalized. According to the manufacturer, for each degree different in the post versus the \nbaseline, the capacity was either increased or decreased .25% per degree.\nThe boundary of the testing was at each chiller therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance calculations is high.\nThis report is provided to Major Global Bank.

The delta of these measurements and associated calculations demonstrate \nthe amount of thermal capacity recovery.\nThe flow of the evaporator and condenser were measured using NIST calibrated instruments (National Institutes of \nStandards and Technology) for the verification of accurate GPM measurement. \nThe remaining measurements were obtained locally from the chiller control panel. The chillers were then treated with \nPermaFrost NMR® on the same day and allowed to run normally to ensure the patented surface science nanotechnology \nhad ample time to become assimilated into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All critical measurements were \ntaken at similar incoming condenser water temperatures as well as outdoor air temperatures however routine adjustments \nto normalize the capacity due to warmer or cooler entering condenser temperatures were applied as per the IPMVP \nprotocol.\nThis report is provided to Major Global Bank.
