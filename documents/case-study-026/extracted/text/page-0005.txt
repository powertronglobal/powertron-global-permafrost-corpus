Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results 
Chiller Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Major Global Bank has the problem of thermal degradation in its Chiller systems. The lower operating tonnage and COP 
ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. The 
degraded equipment performance is costing Major Global Bank Properties significant money and wasting energy. The treated 
chillers were using significantly more energy to operate than when they were new. 
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the chillers in the baseline and 
post testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. 
The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 785 operating tons and an average 
improvement of 23.5% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the 
chiller throughout the year.
