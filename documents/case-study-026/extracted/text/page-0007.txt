Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the six (6) Major Global Bank Southwest Data Center chillers combined.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 3311 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: .71 kW/ton * 4,096 tons = 2,908.2 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 2,908.2 kW * 2,193 Annual Operating Hrs = 6,377,683 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 6,377,683 kWh * $.085 = $542,103
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: .56 kW/ton * 4,096 tons = 2,293.8 kW
Annual kWh Post: 2,293.8 kW * 2,193 hours = 5,030,303 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 5,030,303 kWh * .085 cents = $427,576
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $542,103 - $427,576 = $114,527
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $114,527 / 12 = $9,544
Return On Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in all six chillers: $37,003
Estimated Payback Period for Major Global Bank on the chillers: $37,003 / $9,544 = 4 months
Annual Rate of Return = 309.5%
Return on Investment Over 10 Years = 3095% 
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period 
for Major Global Bank for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true 
energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This restored capacity reduces the annual kWh expended 
in the Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller was when operating at the 
original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the 
revised cost to run the chiller at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed. This 
regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours or load the 
chillers will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the chiller to reach the internal 
building set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
