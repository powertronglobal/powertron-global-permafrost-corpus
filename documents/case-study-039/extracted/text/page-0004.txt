Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the Caribbean Telecom Provider cooling units.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Avg. Baseline Capacity: 89.33 kWR
Avg. Adjusted kWE Baseline: .38 kWE /kWR * 113.95 kWR = 43.3 kWE
Avg. Adjusted Baseline kWh: 43.3 kWE * 3,665 Annual Operating Hrs = 158,695 kWh
Avg. Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 158,695 kWh * $.26 = $41,261
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: .30 kWE /kWR * 113.95 kWR = 34.2 kWE
Annual kWh Post: 34.2 kWE * 3,665 hours = 125,343 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 125,343 kWh * $.26 cents = $32,589
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $41,261 - $32,589 = $8,672
Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $8,672 / 12 = $723
Initial Payback Period
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in each 105.5 kWR capacity cooling units: $4,800
Estimated ROI Period for Caribbean Telecom Provider on each cooling unit: $4,800 / $723 = 7 Months
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 181%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 903%
Utilizing data collected during the pilot study, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for 
Caribbean Telecom Provider for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in both capacity and efficiency. Working together, these improvements reduce the 
annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the avg cooling 
unit was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available capacity and then 
subtracting the revised cost to run the avg cooling unit at the same restored capacity after the PermaFrostNMR® ECM 
was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours 
or load % the unit will now operate at due to the restored performance profile. This restored performance profile allows the 
cooling unit to satisfy the internal area set point with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand 
loading.
