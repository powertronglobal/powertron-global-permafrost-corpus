Recovered Wasted Energy with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Like everyone in the world, Caribbean Telecom Provider has the problem of thermal degradation in their Chillers and HVAC 
units. The degraded equipment performance is costing Caribbean Telecom Provider significant operational dollars through 
wasted energy. The pilot cooling units were found to be using significantly more energy to operate than 
when they were new.
The chart below illustrates the performance 
restoration the ECM created in the treated units. The 
average operational efficiency ratings of the units 
before being treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as 
calculated in kWE/kWR, were 0.38.
The average operational efficiency ratings of the units
after being treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as 
calculated in kWE/kWR, are currently 0.30.
The higher baseline kWE/kWR ratings measured 
in-situ were expected when compared to the 
ASHRAE predicted loss of operational performance 
efficiency for similar age and type cooling units.  
Summary of Key Performance Measurements
The table below summarizes the substantial improvements resulting from the implementation of the 
PermaFrost NMR® ECM into the pilot cooling units.
