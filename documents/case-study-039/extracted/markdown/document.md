HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report

Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study

The purpose of this jointly-conducted ECM study between the Caribbean Telecom Provider and PTG engineering teams was threefold.

First, to verify the current capacity and efficiency of two 105.5 kWR cooling units supporting critical Caribbean Telecom Provider

operations in relation to original equipment manufacturer (OEM) design specifications.  Second, to demonstrate

what, if any, material performance changes occur in these same cooling units after being treated with PermaFrost

NMR® ECM.  And third, to determine what, if any, financial benefits are associated with any efficiency

improvements realized.

The identification of cooling units involved in the study is recorded as follows:

• 105.5 kWR Emerson/Liebert CRAC, Mfg date: 2012, R407C, 408 volt-3 Phase, Model DS105ASMOEI5OIA

• 105.5 kWR Peake Split, Mfg date: 2007, HydroCarbon (HC), 408 volt-3 Phase, Model PCC360S3355TDM

ECM Product Brief

PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented surface science nanotechnology that uses Nucleo Molecular

Regenerative (NMR®) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, one-time treatment with no down time

required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type of climate control system in which it is

installed.  The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling efficiency and increased capacity,

both of which result in lower overall costs to operate a system and extended equipment life.

Methodology

After verifying the proper amount of air flowing across the evaporator coil before beginning the pilot, the

subsequent measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with

the Option B of the IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework.

The results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic

engineering formulas:

• kWE = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase)

• kWE / kWR = kWE / Actual Measured Capacity

• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kWE per kWR /3.412)

• Actual Cooling Capacity per Hour = (Measured CMH * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta T) / 12,000 BTU

Recovered Wasted Energy with PermaFrost NMR® ECM

Like everyone in the world, Caribbean Telecom Provider has the problem of thermal degradation in their Chillers and HVAC

units. The degraded equipment performance is costing Caribbean Telecom Provider significant operational dollars through

wasted energy. The pilot cooling units were found to be using significantly more energy to operate than

when they were new.

The chart below illustrates the performance

restoration the ECM created in the treated units. The

average operational efficiency ratings of the units

before being treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as

calculated in kWE/kWR, were 0.38.

The average operational efficiency ratings of the units

after being treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as

calculated in kWE/kWR, are currently 0.30.

The higher baseline kWE/kWR ratings measured

in-situ were expected when compared to the

ASHRAE predicted loss of operational performance

efficiency for similar age and type cooling units.

Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics

The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR®

Post measurement period for the Caribbean Telecom Provider cooling units.

Baseline Energy Consumption

Avg. Baseline Capacity: 89.33 kWR

Avg. Adjusted kWE Baseline: .38 kWE /kWR * 113.95 kWR = 43.3 kWE

Avg. Adjusted Baseline kWh: 43.3 kWE * 3,665 Annual Operating Hrs = 158,695 kWh

Avg. Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 158,695 kWh * $.26 = $41,261

Post Energy Consumption

kW Post: .30 kWE /kWR * 113.95 kWR = 34.2 kWE

Annual kWh Post: 34.2 kWE * 3,665 hours = 125,343 kWh

Annual Cost Post: 125,343 kWh * $.26 cents = $32,589

Savings Per Year

Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $41,261 - $32,589 = $8,672

Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $8,672 / 12 = $723

Initial Payback Period

Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in each 105.5 kWR capacity cooling units: $4,800

Estimated ROI Period for Caribbean Telecom Provider on each cooling unit: $4,800 / $723 = 7 Months

Annual Internal Rate of Return = 181%

Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 903%

Utilizing data collected during the pilot study, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for

Caribbean Telecom Provider for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy

savings resulting from the improvement in both capacity and efficiency. Working together, these improvements reduce the

annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the avg cooling

unit was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available capacity and then

subtracting the revised cost to run the avg cooling unit at the same restored capacity after the PermaFrostNMR® ECM

was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours

or load % the unit will now operate at due to the restored performance profile. This restored performance profile allows the

cooling unit to satisfy the internal area set point with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand

loading.

Caribbean Telecom Provider is Saving More than Just Energy

By treating just the two pilot 105.5 kWE cooling units with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the manner in which

the pilot units are currently being operated, Caribbean Telecom Provider will save approximately 66,704 kWh per year and all the

costs associated with those savings. From an environmental impact standpoint, Caribbean Telecom Provider will also benefit all

the surrounding communities in which they operate.  Imagine the positive environmental impacts of treating

the rest of the Caribbean Telecom Provider portfolio of equipment spread across the equatorial regions of the world.

The 66,704 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 45.6 metric tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions from

being released or any of the following:

Annual greenhouse emissions from:
