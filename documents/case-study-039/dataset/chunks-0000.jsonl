Second, to demonstrate \nwhat, if any, material performance changes occur in these same cooling units after being treated with PermaFrost \nNMR® ECM.  And third, to determine what, if any, financial benefits are associated with any efficiency \nimprovements realized.  \nThe identification of cooling units involved in the study is recorded as follows:\n• 105.5 kWR Emerson/Liebert CRAC, Mfg date: 2012, R407C, 408 volt-3 Phase, Model DS105ASMOEI5OIA\n• 105.5 kWR Peake Split, Mfg date: 2007, HydroCarbon (HC), 408 volt-3 Phase, Model PCC360S3355TDM\nECM Product Brief\nPermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented surface science nanotechnology that uses Nucleo Molecular \nRegenerative (NMR®) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, one-time treatment with no down time \nrequired, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type of climate control system in which it is \ninstalled.  The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling efficiency and increased capacity, \nboth of which result in lower overall costs to operate a system and extended equipment life. \nMethodology\nAfter verifying the proper amount of air flowing across the evaporator coil before beginning the pilot, the \nsubsequent measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with \nthe Option B of the IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. \nThe results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic \nengineering formulas:\n \n• kWE = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) \n \n• kWE / kWR = kWE / Actual Measured Capacity \n \n• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kWE per kWR /3.412)\n \n• Actual Cooling Capacity per Hour = (Measured CMH * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta T) / 12,000 BTU\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website.", "tokens": 798, "chars": 3376, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_041_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:e4ea658c695942249a5203c6cca825880d3a4b560cf96c69648039bf31fa7883"}

The degraded equipment performance is costing Caribbean Telecom Provider significant operational dollars through \nwasted energy. The pilot cooling units were found to be using significantly more energy to operate than \nwhen they were new.\nThe chart below illustrates the performance \nrestoration the ECM created in the treated units. The \naverage operational efficiency ratings of the units \nbefore being treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as \ncalculated in kWE/kWR, were 0.38.\nThe average operational efficiency ratings of the units\nafter being treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as \ncalculated in kWE/kWR, are currently 0.30.\nThe higher baseline kWE/kWR ratings measured \nin-situ were expected when compared to the \nASHRAE predicted loss of operational performance \nefficiency for similar age and type cooling units.  \nSummary of Key Performance Measurements\nThe table below summarizes the substantial improvements resulting from the implementation of the \nPermaFrost NMR® ECM into the pilot cooling units. \nReduction in\nPer Unit Costs\nEquating to a\n21.1% reduction\nCost Per Cooling Unit to Operate\nkWE/kWR\n .08 kWE/kWR\nBaseline\nPost ECM\n0.38\n0.30\nTYPE OF MEASUREMENT\nBASELINE\n0.38\n89.33\n4.81\n2.64\n158,695\n$41,260 \nPOST\n0.3\n113.95\n5.77\n3.33\n125,343\n$32,589 \nRESULTS\n21.1% Reduction\n27.6% Increase\n20% Increase\n26.1% Increase\n33,352 Annual kWh Savings \n$8,671 Annual Energy Cost Savings\nkWE/kWR\nCapacity in kWR\nEnthalpy Delta\nCoeﬃcient of Performance\nAnnual KWh Usage \nEstimated Cost to Operate\nThe full complement of detailed and witnessed measurements are on file with Caribbean Telecom Provider’s Engineering Department\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 681, "chars": 2652, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_041_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_041_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:ad846a63ea504802d20d9fce3c513d6b22d5c20d534c1c77f5c562ee720fcbfc"}

Baseline Capacity: 89.33 kWR\nAvg. Adjusted kWE Baseline: .38 kWE /kWR * 113.95 kWR = 43.3 kWE\nAvg. Adjusted Baseline kWh: 43.3 kWE * 3,665 Annual Operating Hrs = 158,695 kWh\nAvg. Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 158,695 kWh * $.26 = $41,261\nPost Energy Consumption\nkW Post: .30 kWE /kWR * 113.95 kWR = 34.2 kWE\nAnnual kWh Post: 34.2 kWE * 3,665 hours = 125,343 kWh\nAnnual Cost Post: 125,343 kWh * $.26 cents = $32,589\nSavings Per Year\nAvoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $41,261 - $32,589 = $8,672\nEstimated Energy Savings per Month: $8,672 / 12 = $723\nInitial Payback Period\nCost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in each 105.5 kWR capacity cooling units: $4,800\nEstimated ROI Period for Caribbean Telecom Provider on each cooling unit: $4,800 / $723 = 7 Months\nAnnual Internal Rate of Return = 181%\nReturn on Investment Over 5 Years = 903%\nUtilizing data collected during the pilot study, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for \nCaribbean Telecom Provider for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy \nsavings resulting from the improvement in both capacity and efficiency. Working together, these improvements reduce the \nannual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the avg cooling \nunit was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available capacity and then \nsubtracting the revised cost to run the avg cooling unit at the same restored capacity after the PermaFrostNMR® ECM \nwas installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours \nor load % the unit will now operate at due to the restored performance profile. This restored performance profile allows the \ncooling unit to satisfy the internal area set point with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand \nloading.\n3\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\n®\n9.6 \nPassenger vehicles\n2.3\nGarbage trucks of waste sent to\nthe landﬁll instead of recycled\n5,123\nGallons of gasoline\nconsumed\n48,901\nPounds of coal burned\nannually\n106\nBarrels of oil\nconsumed\n6.3\nHomes’ electricity use for\none year\n4\nCaribbean Telecom Provider is Saving More than Just Energy\nBy treating just the two pilot 105.5 kWE cooling units with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the manner in which \nthe pilot units are currently being operated, Caribbean Telecom Provider will save approximately 66,704 kWh per year and all the \ncosts associated with those savings.
