A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any \ntype of system in which it is installed – DX (direct expansion air and chilled water systems), Chillers \n(screw, reciprocating, scroll and centrifugal), heat pumps, ice making equipment.  Specialized \napplications include computer room cooling and dehumidification systems, chiller plants (water and ice \nproduction applications), domestic and industrial refrigeration (ammonia low and ultra low \ntemperature), air-cooled single application water chillers and split and package rooftop HVAC \nequipment.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity, and \nimproved refrigerant velocity – all of which allows a system to achieve set point temperatures in a more \nrapid fashion that reduces system loading and operating periods.  The indirect benefits resulting from \nthe enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW \nhours used, less amp draw at the compressor, less metallic wear and longer overall equipment life.\nEnergy Science Division\nOIL BUILD-UP\nOIL REMOVED\nBEFORE TREATMENT\nAFTER TREATMENT\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 502, "chars": 2301, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_096_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:954666e421ddbeb2a801b228d68e1c8f155913f32718f674f6f13e8ae7adcd9d"}

The unit is owned \nand maintained by Organization A (heretofore referred to as The Company) located in New York, NY. \n[Client Representative], P.E. representing Organization A, oversaw the trial. \nThe improved/restored efficiency on the unit directly attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was \nsubstantial.  The unit now provides cooler supply air with greater efficiency due to the restoration of the \nheat transfer capacity of the evaporator and condenser coils and increased the available useful tonnage. \nPlease note that this system is subjected to excessive discharge refrigerant temperatures and subsequent \npressures.  These issues at times cause nuisance tripping of the discharge pressure safety switch that then \ncauses the unit to shut down.  During the initial baseline data recording period this condition was observed \nand as a result the pressure drop across the condenser coil was measured.  This pressure difference should \nnot exceed 0.50\".  The measured pressure drop measured during this baseline reporting period was in excess \nof 2\".\n \nIt was also our understanding that the condenser coil was cleaned by a service group to attempt to alleviate \nthis condition.  The post energy measurement period revealed that the discharge pressure is  in excess of 305 \npsi.  This necessitated another measurement of the pressure drop across the condenser coil and this revealed \nthat the pressure drop is continuing to measure in excess of 2\".  The method of cleaning to this coil has not \nproduced the required relief for the system to completely condense all of the discharge gas.  We suggest that \nthis condenser coil be cleaned with the proper chemicals and water as the manufacturer instructs.  When \nthis pressure is reduced, the savings as a result of the installation of PermaFrost NMR® will be even greater.\nThe overall system efficiency improved by 12.7% and the EER improved by 12.4%.  There was an increase in \ncoil capacity of 19,969 in Btuh which equates to gaining 1.7-tons of capacity or 12.5%.  There is also a \nreduction of 10.9% in total power and watts per ton which is another measurable way to view the \nthermodynamic enhancement of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The tables of data and financial calculations \nare available for review at the end of this report.  The result of these combined ECM improvements is an \nROI to The Company of 27.2 months.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 698, "chars": 3167, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_096_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_096_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:b17f38cee44aab0938d9a7f9b7a22dc461d7262528480eff6271003ffa2b4a74"}

The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and \nAir-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the \nIPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and \nproducts.\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize.  They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.  Option B is \ndefined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (Permafrost NMR®) as the single \nsource of measurement.  Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM \naffected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using \nmeasurements of proxies of energy use. \nThe final computation follows the formula:\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+ - Routine adjustments + - Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 450, "chars": 2235, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_096_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_096_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:f600956671b2018d3abc156c832c1732344fe2fc5eeb993165ae4f77dd7e7f92"}
