Performance Report on PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Comfort-Aire Unit at Organization A
July 26, 2012
Product Brief
         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface science Energy Control Measure 
(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) technology as its core agent.  A sustainable, 
one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any 
type of system in which it is installed – DX (direct expansion air and chilled water systems), Chillers 
(screw, reciprocating, scroll and centrifugal), heat pumps, ice making equipment.  Specialized 
applications include computer room cooling and dehumidification systems, chiller plants (water and ice 
production applications), domestic and industrial refrigeration (ammonia low and ultra low 
temperature), air-cooled single application water chillers and split and package rooftop HVAC 
equipment.
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity, and 
improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allows a system to achieve set point temperatures in a more 
rapid fashion that reduces system loading and operating periods.  The indirect benefits resulting from 
the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW 
hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, less metallic wear and longer overall equipment life.

Executive Summary
This report contains specific information regarding the installation of PermaFrost NMR® in the 20-ton 
Comfort-Aire DX HVAC unit at Organization A, 2nd floor, [Commercial Address], NY.  The unit is owned 
and maintained by Organization A (heretofore referred to as The Company) located in New York, NY. 
[Client Representative], P.E. representing Organization A, oversaw the trial. 
The improved/restored efficiency on the unit directly attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was 
substantial.  The unit now provides cooler supply air with greater efficiency due to the restoration of the 
heat transfer capacity of the evaporator and condenser coils and increased the available useful tonnage. 
Please note that this system is subjected to excessive discharge refrigerant temperatures and subsequent 
pressures.  These issues at times cause nuisance tripping of the discharge pressure safety switch that then 
causes the unit to shut down.  During the initial baseline data recording period this condition was observed 
and as a result the pressure drop across the condenser coil was measured.  This pressure difference should 
not exceed 0.50".  The measured pressure drop measured during this baseline reporting period was in excess 
of 2".
 
It was also our understanding that the condenser coil was cleaned by a service group to attempt to alleviate 
this condition.  The post energy measurement period revealed that the discharge pressure is  in excess of 305 
psi.  This necessitated another measurement of the pressure drop across the condenser coil and this revealed 
that the pressure drop is continuing to measure in excess of 2".  The method of cleaning to this coil has not 
produced the required relief for the system to completely condense all of the discharge gas.  We suggest that 
this condenser coil be cleaned with the proper chemicals and water as the manufacturer instructs.  When 
this pressure is reduced, the savings as a result of the installation of PermaFrost NMR® will be even greater.
The overall system efficiency improved by 12.7% and the EER improved by 12.4%.  There was an increase in 
coil capacity of 19,969 in Btuh which equates to gaining 1.7-tons of capacity or 12.5%.  There is also a 
reduction of 10.9% in total power and watts per ton which is another measurable way to view the 
thermodynamic enhancement of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The tables of data and financial calculations 
are available for review at the end of this report.  The result of these combined ECM improvements is an 
ROI to The Company of 27.2 months.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocols (IPMVP) are used to develop this 
report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and 
Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the 
IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and 
products.
There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize.  They 
are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.  Option B is 
defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (Permafrost NMR®) as the single 
source of measurement.  Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM 
affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term 
measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by 
short-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using 
measurements of proxies of energy use. 
The final computation follows the formula:
Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy
+ - Routine adjustments + - Non-Routine Adjustments

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces.
 
The Company made the decision to treat the unit as it was the main unit supporting the office.  A diagnostic 
examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the unit’s operational conditions were 
satisfactory.  Baseline measurements were recorded and then the proper amount and type of PermaFrost 
NMR® was injected.  The product was then allowed four (4) weeks to seat itself into the metal surfaces 
before post measurements were taken to establish the efficiency gains. 
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP International Performance Measurement and 
Verification Protocol as the M&V plan. The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global’s Senior 
Energy Engineer [Senior Energy Engineer] ME/CEM/CMC/CMVP.
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
kW = Volts * Amps * 1.56 (3-Phase) /1000 
 
Delta T = Return Air DB – Supply Air DB
 
Enthalpy = Return Air WB Deg. F and Supply Air WB Deg. F Converted to Enthalpy
 
Actual Btuh Capacity = Measured CFM X 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta 
 
System Eﬃciency % = Actual Coil Capacity Btuh / Nominal Coil Capacity Btuh
 
EER = Btuh / Watts

Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to determine a very accurate ROI for 
The Company for implementing this ECM:
Baseline kWh = (27,780 CTW / 1,000) * 1,800 Annual Operating Hrs = 50,004 kWh
Baseline Cost To Run = 50,004 kWh * $.18 = $9,001
Regression Analysis is then used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Unit #1
Adjusted Base Tonnage = 14.93 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted Total Watts = 2,093 WPT * 14.93 tons = 31,248 W
Adjusted Base kWh = (31,248 W/1,000) * 1,800 Annual Operating Hrs = 56,246 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM = 56,246 kWh * $.18 = $10,124
Post ECM kWh = (27,834 W / 1,000) * 1,800 Annual Operating Hrs = 50,101 kWh
Cost to Run After ECM = 50,101 kWh * $.18 = $9,018
Cost Savings per Month = ($10,124 - $9,018) / 12 = $92
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed @ $2,500 / $92 = 27.2
 
ROI = 27.2 months
