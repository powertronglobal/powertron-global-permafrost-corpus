Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to determine a very accurate ROI for 
The Company for implementing this ECM:
Baseline kWh = (27,780 CTW / 1,000) * 1,800 Annual Operating Hrs = 50,004 kWh
Baseline Cost To Run = 50,004 kWh * $.18 = $9,001
Regression Analysis is then used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Unit #1
Adjusted Base Tonnage = 14.93 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted Total Watts = 2,093 WPT * 14.93 tons = 31,248 W
Adjusted Base kWh = (31,248 W/1,000) * 1,800 Annual Operating Hrs = 56,246 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM = 56,246 kWh * $.18 = $10,124
Post ECM kWh = (27,834 W / 1,000) * 1,800 Annual Operating Hrs = 50,101 kWh
Cost to Run After ECM = 50,101 kWh * $.18 = $9,018
Cost Savings per Month = ($10,124 - $9,018) / 12 = $92
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed @ $2,500 / $92 = 27.2
 
ROI = 27.2 months
