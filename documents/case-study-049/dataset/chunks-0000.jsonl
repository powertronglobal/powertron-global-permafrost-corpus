Many industry leading \norganizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age. \nThermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVAC/R equipment that operates as a \nvapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well \ndocumented by the HVAC/R industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal \ndegradation prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times \nand additional kWh consumption.\nThe chiller in this study is representative of a great majority of the portfolio of equipment operated by Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer. \nIf thermal degradation is present in this chiller it is present in the entire inventory of equipment. Energy waste \ncan be calculated based on this equipment (portfolio representation) and then accurately extrapolated across \nthe entire inventory of equipment.\nAs demonstrated in this field trial, PermaFrost NMR® restores the capacity of chiller systems lost over time due \nto fouling of the heat exchange surfaces in both the evaporator and condenser barrels. This restoration of \ncapacity will manifest itself in any or all of the following ways:\n• Ability of the chiller to better satisfy fluctuating building loads or lower room temps\n• Produce additional redundancy at no extra cost or interruption to facility operations \n• Improve chiller efficiency, lowering cost to produce each ton of cooling required \n• Restore thermal efficiency, allowing chiller to achieve CW set point at lower load\n• Improve chiller performance and extending equipment life by 15%+ \n• Reduce overall energy consumption and peak demand charges (KVA) \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 691, "chars": 3317, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_050_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:fd54185f0dc5d654265bf23c4cf8ab22dd434e1a698f3f40499ea1ddf0b1a0d4"}

Eight weeks after installation, the cooling capacity increased by 151 tons or 21.5% to 854 tons. \n• The overall cost to produce each ton of cooling on the pilot chiller system dropped 18.6% from .587 \n   kW/ton in the baseline to .478 kW/ton eight weeks after installation. This means that for every ton of \n   cooling the pilot chiller system is asked to produce, Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer is spending 18.6% less to do so.\n• The projected annual kWh’s were reduced by 18.6% from 1,503,000 to 1,224,000.\n• The Coefficient of Performance (COP) for the pilot chiller system was increased from 5.99 in the \n   baseline to 7.36 in the post which represents an increase in efficiency of 22.9%\nThe chiller system involved in the study is recorded as follows:\n York; Mfg date 2001; R22 Refrigerant; Nominal 1,000-ton capacity, 480 volt-3 Phase,\n Model 4KHHHBJ1, SN 035-18644-000\n \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 597, "chars": 2447, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_050_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_050_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:78395fdc6bc0f180ea03e4d2c8f415ce01c89a3e6998e205e6277448d78ea2d0"}

The team was led by Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer’s \n Testing Manager, [Client Representative], P.E., was supported by Commercial Real Estate Services’s [Facility Manager], Facility Manager and Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer].  \nNotes \nThe chiller tested (see photo below) is one of the most efficient types of chillers York manufactured at that point in time.  \nBoth the baseline and post measurement s were taken with outside air temperatures of 63 and 65 respectfully. The effect of \nthis slight difference in temperature as well as a similar slight difference in incoming condenser water from the tower are \nboth within the industry-accepted margin of error and thereby considered insignificant in terms of overall results.  \nGlobal Telecom Equipment Manufacturer’s repeatable management of the chiller \nplant during the trial provided more than an \nadequate heat load on the facility to ensure the \nchiller would remain running during the actual \ndata collection period. \nThe boundary of the testing was the chiller and \nnothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy \nof the performance calculations is very high.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\n4\nEnergy Conservation Method (ECM)\nThe content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the pilot chiller to perform prior to the \nECM being installed, as well as illustrate the amount of thermal degradation \nwithin the heat exchangers.\nThe following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. \nThe results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:\n \n• kW = (Volts * Amps * Power Factor * Sq root of 3)/1000 (for 3-Phase) \n \n• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage \n \n• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)\n \n• Cooling Tons per Hr = (Evaporator GPM * 8.34 * 60 * CW Delta T) / 12,000 BTU \n \n• Refrigerant Approach = CW Supply Temp – Saturated Evaporator Temp (CH) \nNotes \nFollowing a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to determine the operational condition of the systems was \nsatisfactory, Baseline M&V data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. 600+ hours after installation of the ECM, \nthe M&V team returned on a very similar weather day to the Baseline to take Post M&V measurements in the identical \nfashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements and associated calculations show the amount of capacity \nrestored.\nThe following IPMVP data points were recorded on 5 May 2014 using recently calibrated devices by NIST (National \nInstitutes of Standards and Technology) to insure measurement accuracy. The chiller was then treated with PermaFrost \nNMR® on the same day and allowed to run at greater than 70% load until 26 June 2014 to ensure the patented surface \nscience nanotechnology had ample time to seat into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All measurements were \ntaken at 70% load and at similar outdoor air temperatures. \nThe York chiller treated has a nominal capacity of 1,000 tons at 100% load and 2,400 gallons per minute (GPM) flow \nthrough the evaporator.  The chiller used in this pilot was tested at 70% load with a GPM of 2,675. This scenario creates a \ntype of false-positive tonnage amount but since normal operations were not to be changed for the pilot, the emphasis here is \non the delta between baseline and post.\nThe collection of the data in both the baseline and post periods was collected by Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer with participation by Commercial Real Estate Services and Powertron Global.

Together these improvements reduce the annual kWh expended annually \nin the future. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller system was when operating at the original energy \nprofile to produce the newly restored amount of available capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the chiller system \nat the same restored capacity after PermaFrost NMR® was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method \nof accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or load % at which the chiller system will now operate due to the restored \nperformance profile. This restored performance profile allows the chiller system to satisfy the chilled water set points with \nincreased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading. \n \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 671, "chars": 2924, "pages": {"start": 7, "end": 8}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_050_chunk_0004", "next_id": "pdf_050_chunk_0006", "content_hash": "sha256:7effea9787b473845c956e8c1dfa95ad5aefc30ee9afb2cd41f138483cff629b"}
