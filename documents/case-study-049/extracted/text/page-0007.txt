Recovered Unit Cost with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration the ECM created in the treated chiller.
The average cost to operate this chiller before it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR® as calculated in 
kW/ton was .587.
The specific cost to operate this chiller after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR® as calculated in 
kW/ton is currently .478.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ 
was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate 
for a 13 year old chiller. The post results are also in 
line with the average improvement savings shown 
over more than 135,000 installations globally.
