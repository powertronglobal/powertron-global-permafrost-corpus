Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements before and after PermaFrost NMR® 
was installed on the pilot chiller system. 
Average Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Capacity:  703 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline:  .587 kW/ton * 854 tons = 501 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh:  501 kW * 3,000 Annual Operating Hours = 1,503,000 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 1,503,000 kWh * $.12 = $180,360
Avgerage Post Energy Consumption
kW Post:  .478 kW/ton * 854 tons = 408 kW
Annual kWh Post:  408 kW * 3,000 hours = 1,224,000 kWh
Annual Cost Post:  1,224,000 kWh * $.12 cents = $146,880
Average Savings per Year Per System
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year:  $180,360 - $146,880 = $33,480
Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $33,480 / 12 = $2,790
Return on Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot chiller system: $29,500
Estimated ROI for Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer when treating the pilot chiller system: $29,500 / $2,790 = ~10.6 mos
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 113%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 567%
Explanation of Regression Analysis
To obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, 
a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy savings resulting from the improvement in both capacity and 
efficiency utilizing data collected during the pilot study. Together these improvements reduce the annual kWh expended annually 
in the future. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller system was when operating at the original energy 
profile to produce the newly restored amount of available capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the chiller system 
at the same restored capacity after PermaFrost NMR® was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method 
of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or load % at which the chiller system will now operate due to the restored 
performance profile. This restored performance profile allows the chiller system to satisfy the chilled water set points with 
increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
