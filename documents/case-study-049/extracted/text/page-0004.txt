Methodology
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the 
IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team was led by Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer’s 
 Testing Manager, [Client Representative], P.E., was supported by Commercial Real Estate Services’s [Facility Manager], Facility Manager and Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer].  
Notes 
The chiller tested (see photo below) is one of the most efficient types of chillers York manufactured at that point in time.  
Both the baseline and post measurement s were taken with outside air temperatures of 63 and 65 respectfully. The effect of 
this slight difference in temperature as well as a similar slight difference in incoming condenser water from the tower are 
both within the industry-accepted margin of error and thereby considered insignificant in terms of overall results.  
Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer’s repeatable management of the chiller 
plant during the trial provided more than an 
adequate heat load on the facility to ensure the 
chiller would remain running during the actual 
data collection period. 
The boundary of the testing was the chiller and 
nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy 
of the performance calculations is very high.
