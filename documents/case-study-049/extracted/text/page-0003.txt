Highlights of the study:
When comparing the pilot chiller system before and eight weeks after PermaFrost NMR® was installed, below 
are some of the highlights of the study:
• When initially tested, the pilot chiller system was producing 703 tons of cooling at the given testing 
   conditions. Eight weeks after installation, the cooling capacity increased by 151 tons or 21.5% to 854 tons. 
• The overall cost to produce each ton of cooling on the pilot chiller system dropped 18.6% from .587 
   kW/ton in the baseline to .478 kW/ton eight weeks after installation. This means that for every ton of 
   cooling the pilot chiller system is asked to produce, Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer is spending 18.6% less to do so.
• The projected annual kWh’s were reduced by 18.6% from 1,503,000 to 1,224,000.
• The Coefficient of Performance (COP) for the pilot chiller system was increased from 5.99 in the 
   baseline to 7.36 in the post which represents an increase in efficiency of 22.9%
The chiller system involved in the study is recorded as follows:
 York; Mfg date 2001; R22 Refrigerant; Nominal 1,000-ton capacity, 480 volt-3 Phase,
 Model 4KHHHBJ1, SN 035-18644-000
