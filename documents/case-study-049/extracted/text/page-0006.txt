Chiller Eﬃciency Study Results 
Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer has the problem of thermal degradation in its chillers. The lower operating tonnage and COP ratings 
measured on site in the baseline were in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate 
numbers. The degraded equipment performance was costing Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer significant money and wasting energy. 
The chiller was shown in the baseline to be using significantly more kWh to operate than it used when it was 
new. 
The performance results include the measured efficiency and tonnage of the chiller in the baseline and post 
testing periods demonstrating the negative impact thermal degradation had on the chiller and how PermaFrost 
NMR® was able to reverse that and restore capacity.
