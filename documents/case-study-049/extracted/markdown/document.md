HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report

Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study

The purpose of this study is to verify the industry wide problem of efficiency loss in HVAC/R as projected by

ASHRAE research and to quantify the amount of money wasted due to this loss. Many industry leading

organizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age.

Thermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVAC/R equipment that operates as a

vapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well

documented by the HVAC/R industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal

degradation prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times

and additional kWh consumption.

The chiller in this study is representative of a great majority of the portfolio of equipment operated by Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer.

If thermal degradation is present in this chiller it is present in the entire inventory of equipment. Energy waste

can be calculated based on this equipment (portfolio representation) and then accurately extrapolated across

the entire inventory of equipment.

As demonstrated in this field trial, PermaFrost NMR® restores the capacity of chiller systems lost over time due

to fouling of the heat exchange surfaces in both the evaporator and condenser barrels. This restoration of

capacity will manifest itself in any or all of the following ways:

• Ability of the chiller to better satisfy fluctuating building loads or lower room temps

• Produce additional redundancy at no extra cost or interruption to facility operations

• Improve chiller efficiency, lowering cost to produce each ton of cooling required

• Restore thermal efficiency, allowing chiller to achieve CW set point at lower load

• Improve chiller performance and extending equipment life by 15%+

• Reduce overall energy consumption and peak demand charges (KVA)

Highlights of the study:

When comparing the pilot chiller system before and eight weeks after PermaFrost NMR® was installed, below

are some of the highlights of the study:

• When initially tested, the pilot chiller system was producing 703 tons of cooling at the given testing

conditions. Eight weeks after installation, the cooling capacity increased by 151 tons or 21.5% to 854 tons.

• The overall cost to produce each ton of cooling on the pilot chiller system dropped 18.6% from .587

kW/ton in the baseline to .478 kW/ton eight weeks after installation. This means that for every ton of

cooling the pilot chiller system is asked to produce, Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer is spending 18.6% less to do so.

• The projected annual kWh’s were reduced by 18.6% from 1,503,000 to 1,224,000.

• The Coefficient of Performance (COP) for the pilot chiller system was increased from 5.99 in the

baseline to 7.36 in the post which represents an increase in efficiency of 22.9%

The chiller system involved in the study is recorded as follows:

York; Mfg date 2001; R22 Refrigerant; Nominal 1,000-ton capacity, 480 volt-3 Phase,

Model 4KHHHBJ1, SN 035-18644-000

Methodology

The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the

IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team was led by Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer’s

 Testing Manager, [Client Representative], P.E., was supported by Commercial Real Estate Services’s Michael

Graziano, Facility Manager and Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer].

Notes

The chiller tested (see photo below) is one of the most efficient types of chillers York manufactured at that point in time.

Both the baseline and post measurement s were taken with outside air temperatures of 63 and 65 respectfully. The effect of

this slight difference in temperature as well as a similar slight difference in incoming condenser water from the tower are

both within the industry-accepted margin of error and thereby considered insignificant in terms of overall results.

Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer’s repeatable management of the chiller

plant during the trial provided more than an

adequate heat load on the facility to ensure the

chiller would remain running during the actual

data collection period.

The boundary of the testing was the chiller and

nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy

of the performance calculations is very high.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)

The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the pilot chiller to perform prior to the

ECM being installed, as well as illustrate the amount of thermal degradation

within the heat exchangers.

The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan.

The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:

• kW = (Volts * Amps * Power Factor * Sq root of 3)/1000 (for 3-Phase)

• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage

• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)

• Cooling Tons per Hr = (Evaporator GPM * 8.34 * 60 * CW Delta T) / 12,000 BTU

• Refrigerant Approach = CW Supply Temp – Saturated Evaporator Temp (CH)

Notes

Following a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to determine the operational condition of the systems was

satisfactory, Baseline M&V data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. 600+ hours after installation of the ECM,

the M&V team returned on a very similar weather day to the Baseline to take Post M&V measurements in the identical

fashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements and associated calculations show the amount of capacity

restored.

The following IPMVP data points were recorded on 5 May 2014 using recently calibrated devices by NIST (National

Institutes of Standards and Technology) to insure measurement accuracy. The chiller was then treated with PermaFrost

NMR® on the same day and allowed to run at greater than 70% load until 26 June 2014 to ensure the patented surface

science nanotechnology had ample time to seat into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All measurements were

taken at 70% load and at similar outdoor air temperatures.

The York chiller treated has a nominal capacity of 1,000 tons at 100% load and 2,400 gallons per minute (GPM) flow

through the evaporator.  The chiller used in this pilot was tested at 70% load with a GPM of 2,675. This scenario creates a

type of false-positive tonnage amount but since normal operations were not to be changed for the pilot, the emphasis here is

on the delta between baseline and post.

The collection of the data in both the baseline and post periods was collected by Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer with participation by Commercial Real Estate Services and Powertron Global. The measurements are listed below.

Chiller Eﬃciency Study Results

Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer has the problem of thermal degradation in its chillers. The lower operating tonnage and COP ratings

measured on site in the baseline were in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate

numbers. The degraded equipment performance was costing Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer significant money and wasting energy.

The chiller was shown in the baseline to be using significantly more kWh to operate than it used when it was

new.

The performance results include the measured efficiency and tonnage of the chiller in the baseline and post

testing periods demonstrating the negative impact thermal degradation had on the chiller and how PermaFrost

NMR® was able to reverse that and restore capacity.

Recovered Unit Cost with PermaFrost NMR® ECM

The chart to the right illustrates the performance

restoration the ECM created in the treated chiller.

The average cost to operate this chiller before it was

treated with PermaFrost NMR® as calculated in

kW/ton was .587.

The specific cost to operate this chiller after it was

treated with PermaFrost NMR® as calculated in

kW/ton is currently .478.

The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ

was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of

performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate

for a 13 year old chiller. The post results are also in

line with the average improvement savings shown

over more than 135,000 installations globally.

Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics

The following are the final calculated average performance measurements before and after PermaFrost NMR®

was installed on the pilot chiller system.

Average Baseline Energy Consumption

Baseline Capacity:  703 tons

Adjusted kW Baseline:  .587 kW/ton * 854 tons = 501 kW

Adjusted Baseline kWh:  501 kW * 3,000 Annual Operating Hours = 1,503,000 kWh

Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 1,503,000 kWh * $.12 = $180,360

Avgerage Post Energy Consumption

kW Post:  .478 kW/ton * 854 tons = 408 kW

Annual kWh Post:  408 kW * 3,000 hours = 1,224,000 kWh

Annual Cost Post:  1,224,000 kWh * $.12 cents = $146,880

Average Savings per Year Per System

Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year:  $180,360 - $146,880 = $33,480

Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $33,480 / 12 = $2,790

Return on Investment

Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot chiller system: $29,500

Estimated ROI for Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer when treating the pilot chiller system: $29,500 / $2,790 = ~10.6 mos

Annual Internal Rate of Return = 113%

Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 567%

Explanation of Regression Analysis

To obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM,

a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy savings resulting from the improvement in both capacity and

efficiency utilizing data collected during the pilot study. Together these improvements reduce the annual kWh expended annually

in the future. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller system was when operating at the original energy

profile to produce the newly restored amount of available capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the chiller system

at the same restored capacity after PermaFrost NMR® was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method

of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or load % at which the chiller system will now operate due to the restored

performance profile. This restored performance profile allows the chiller system to satisfy the chilled water set points with

increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
