Many industry leading \norganizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age. \nThermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVACR equipment that operates as a \nvapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well \ndocumented by the HVACR industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal degradation \nprevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times and \nadditional kWh consumption.\nThe representative sample of equipment in this study is an agreed upon sampling that represents the portfolio \nof equipment operated by Major US Warehouse Retailer. If thermal degradation is present in these machines it is present in the entire \ninventory of equipment. Energy waste can be calculated based on this equipment (portfolio representation) and \nthen accurately extrapolated across the entire inventory of equipment.\nTop image is one of the 19 HVAC Equipment Manufacturer RTUs (immediately above) supporting the Major US Warehouse Retailer [Southeast Facility]. Three of these RTU’s were forensically \ntested using the IPMVP methodology to determine their performance capabilities. \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 573, "chars": 2713, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_037_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:565ea3ce8d60ff1430ffe9c7d5614e8f6d85824404f430f0220bf1a599e60ff3"}

A second report will focus \non the substantial refrigeration plant in the store.\nFor this phase, detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the RTUs before (baseline) \nand after (post) the installation of the ECM. This testing determined the impact on three key elements relating \nto the original design specifications that greatly affect the HVAC portion of Major US Warehouse Retailer’s power bill. They include:\n1.  The cooling capacity the RTUs are capable of producing after 11 years in service. \n2.  The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the RTUs are delivering as reflected \n     in the kW/ton measurement. \n3.  The thermal dynamic ability of the equipment to still perform at or close to operational design. \nMethodology\nThe measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the \nIPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework and the standards set forth by the \nNational Environmental Balancing Bureau (NEBB). \n \n \nDavid Millard, Certified TAB Technician with Test & Balance Company A (T&B Company A), \n \n \nrecorded all of the pilot measurements while being observed by Powertron Global’s Director of \n \n \nEngineering, [Senior Energy Engineer]. The T&B Company A report is attached as Appendix A at the end of this report. \nThe baseline day chosen to test the RTU’s was an average day temperature and humidity-wise for the \n[Florida Location] area which ensured repeatability of similar weather for the post testing measurements. The \nweather conditions along with the weekday lunchtime crowds patronizing the facility provided an adequate \nheat load on the facility to ensure all compressors would remain running during the actual data collection \nperiod required for each. The boundary of the testing was each of the RTU’s and nothing else; therefore \nconfidence in the accuracy of the performance calculations is very high.\n \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 561, "chars": 3012, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_037_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_037_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:f618668b7724949eb8d5cf4a235528f364cdfcce979ca11bf3da5c8bbc1ef651"}

Approximately \none month after installation of the ECM, the M&V team returned on a very similar weather day to the Baseline \nto take Post M&V measurements in the identical fashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements \nand associated calculations show the amount of capacity restored.\nThe following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. \nThe results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:\n• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) \n• Ton = (Airflow * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta) / 12,000 \n• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage \n• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)\nNotes \nThe IPMVP data points were recorded and certified by the T&B Company A Certified TAB \nTechnician on 4 April 2014 and again on 8 May 2014 using recently calibrated \ndevices by NIST (National Institutes of Standards and Technology) to insure \nmeasurement accuracy. The three RTUs were then treated with PermaFrost \nNMR® following recording of the measurements on 4 April 2014 and allowed \nto run normally until 8 May 2014 to ensure the patented surface science \nnanotechnology ECM had ample time to seat into all the metal surfaces of the \nheat exchangers. All measurements were taken at full load (all compressors \nrunning) and at identical outdoor air temperatures and similar mid-day times \nand numbers of shoppers.\nTo ensure the integrity of the data, the collection of the measurements in both \nthe baseline and post periods were conducted and recorded entirely by T&B Company A. \nThe measurements are listed below.

These same three pilot RTUs were determined to be performing at an \naverage of 77.6% of the original design efficiency in the baseline. The actual design rated tonnage of each of the \nRTUs is 15, 25 and 25 tons respectively, for a total of 65 tons. In actuality, the three RTUs were only producing a \ntotal of 50.8 tons at the start of the pilot.  The majority of this 22.4% efficiency loss is directly attributable to the \nthermal degradation of the heat exchange surfaces over a short period of time. \nAfter the ECM was installed, the average efficiency in each of the RTUs jumped up to 95.6% of design \nspecifications, equating to 62.5 total tons.

The average cost to \noperate these three pilot RTUs as calculated in kW/ ton was 1.36 in the Baseline. When new, the kW/ton rating \nfor units like these usually ranges from .9 - 1.05 kW/ton. This means Major US Warehouse Retailer was paying up to 22.8% more than \ndesign for energy to run the RTUs as a direct result of the baseline reduced level of performance. The kW/ton \nratings measured on site in [Southeast Location] were very much in line with the published ASHRAE loss of \nperformance averages.  \nThe restored average kW/ton rating following the ECM is now 1.07. This represents a 21.3% reduction in \nenergy costs from the baseline for every ton of cooling produced. It also brings down the Major US Warehouse Retailer costs to \noperate the RTUs to just 3% over design. This will result in an initial payback period to Major US Warehouse Retailer of \napproximately 12-13 months. Over just a few years these accumulated savings will greatly reduce the eventual \nCapEx costs to replace the RTUs when they finally reach the end of their useful life.   \nOriginal Design\nEﬃciency\nASHRAE Projected\nCost to Operate\nOver Time\nActual Cost to\nOperate Major US Warehouse Retailer\nSystems As Is\nOperational Cost %\nActual Major US Warehouse Retailer HVAC/R Operating Cost\nvs. ASHRAE Historical Performance\n-40\n-20\n00\n20\n40\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n \n \n \nAvg Age of Major US Warehouse Retailer\nEquipment\n11\nEXPECTED COST\nAge of HVAC/R Units\n23%\nin Energy\nSavings\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 594, "chars": 2582, "pages": {"start": 7, "end": 8}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_037_chunk_0006", "next_id": "pdf_037_chunk_0008", "content_hash": "sha256:509437875603bc60d2474c46d4827d451690316963fd9dabddd55f9a47783a15"}

This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended \nin the Avoided Energy Reporting (Post) Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems \nwas when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity \nand then subtracting the revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® ECM \nwas installed.
