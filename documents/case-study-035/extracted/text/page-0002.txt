HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report
Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study
The purpose of this study is to verify the industry wide problem of efficiency loss in HVAC/R as projected by
ASHRAE research and to quantify the amount of money wasted due to this loss. Many industry leading 
organizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age. 
Thermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVACR equipment that operates as a 
vapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well 
documented by the HVACR industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal degradation 
prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times and 
additional kWh consumption.
The representative sample of equipment in this study is an agreed upon sampling that represents the portfolio 
of equipment operated by Major US Warehouse Retailer. If thermal degradation is present in these machines it is present in the entire 
inventory of equipment. Energy waste can be calculated based on this equipment (portfolio representation) and 
then accurately extrapolated across the entire inventory of equipment.

tested using the IPMVP methodology to determine their performance capabilities.
