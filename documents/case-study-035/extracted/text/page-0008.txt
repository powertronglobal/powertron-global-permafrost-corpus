HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Cost to Major US Warehouse Retailer to Operate the [Southeast Location] HVAC RTUs Baseline vs Post
The next chart illustrates the just how much money the efficiency performance loss in the pilot RTUs was 
costing Major US Warehouse Retailer in the way of wasted energy each they were operating prior to the ECM. The average cost to 
operate these three pilot RTUs as calculated in kW/ ton was 1.36 in the Baseline. When new, the kW/ton rating 
for units like these usually ranges from .9 - 1.05 kW/ton. This means Major US Warehouse Retailer was paying up to 22.8% more than 
design for energy to run the RTUs as a direct result of the baseline reduced level of performance. The kW/ton 
ratings measured on site in [Southeast Location] were very much in line with the published ASHRAE loss of 
performance averages.  
The restored average kW/ton rating following the ECM is now 1.07. This represents a 21.3% reduction in 
energy costs from the baseline for every ton of cooling produced. It also brings down the Major US Warehouse Retailer costs to 
operate the RTUs to just 3% over design. This will result in an initial payback period to Major US Warehouse Retailer of 
approximately 12-13 months. Over just a few years these accumulated savings will greatly reduce the eventual 
CapEx costs to replace the RTUs when they finally reach the end of their useful life.
