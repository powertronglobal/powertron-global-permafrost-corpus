The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the three Major US Warehouse Retailer Packaged RTUs.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Adjusted Baseline Tonnage: 50.8 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: 1.36 kW/ton * 62.5 tons = 85 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 85 kW * 3,500 Annual Operating Hrs = 297,500 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 297,500 kWh * $.105 = $31,238
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: 1.07 kW/ton * 62.5 tons = 66.88 kW
Annual kWh Post: 66.88 kW * 3,500 hours = 234,080 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 234,080 kWh * .105 cents = $24,578
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $31,238 - $24,578 = $6,660
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $6,660 / 12 = $555
Return On Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in three pilot RTUs: $6,663
Estimated ROI Period for Major US Warehouse Retailer on three RTUs: $6,663 / $555 = 12 months
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period 
for Major US Warehouse Retailer for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true 
energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended 
in the Avoided Energy Reporting (Post) Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems 
was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity 
and then subtracting the revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® ECM 
was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of 
hours the systems will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the 
internal building set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
