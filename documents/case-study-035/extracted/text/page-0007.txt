HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Calculated Eﬃciency of Major US Warehouse Retailer HVAC RTUs Baseline and Post
The chart below illustrates just how far off design the Major US Warehouse Retailer pilot RTUs (#3, #14 and #18) had degraded in 
terms of efficiency over 11 years of use. These same three pilot RTUs were determined to be performing at an 
average of 77.6% of the original design efficiency in the baseline. The actual design rated tonnage of each of the 
RTUs is 15, 25 and 25 tons respectively, for a total of 65 tons. In actuality, the three RTUs were only producing a 
total of 50.8 tons at the start of the pilot.  The majority of this 22.4% efficiency loss is directly attributable to the 
thermal degradation of the heat exchange surfaces over a short period of time. 
After the ECM was installed, the average efficiency in each of the RTUs jumped up to 95.6% of design 
specifications, equating to 62.5 total tons. This represents a 23% increase in efficiency over the baseline 
numbers.
