SCOPE OF WORK
Our scope of work for this project was to pretest the three roof-top units for total air
volume, cooling coil performance test and static pressure across the ‘Dx’ coil prior to a
PermaFrost NMR insert.
After one month, a final test was performed to obtain the same data to determine BTUH
increase performance under the same conditions.
