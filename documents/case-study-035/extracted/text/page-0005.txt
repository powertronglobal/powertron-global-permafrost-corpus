Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results (across all 3 pilot units)
RTU Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Major US Warehouse Retailer has the problem of thermal degradation in its HVAC/R units. The low operating tonnage & COP 
ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. The 
degraded equipment performance is costing Major US Warehouse Retailer significant money and wasting energy. The equipment is 
using significantly more kWh to operate than they did when they were new. The efficiency summary includes 
all HVAC units measured, combining the current efficiency & tonnage of all units. This summary is the 
cumulative impact of thermal degradation on the portfolio sampling.
The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 11.7 operating tons and an average 
improvement of 26.5% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate.
