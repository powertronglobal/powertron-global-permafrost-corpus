Recovered Wasted Energy with ECM – 3 RTUs
The chart to the right illustrates the performance
restoration the ECM created in the treated RTUs.
The average cost to operate these RTUs before 
they were treated with PermaFrost NMR® as 
calculated in kW/ton was 1.38.
The specific cost to operate these RTUs after they 
were been treated with PermaFrost NMR® as 
calculated in kW/ton is currently 1.07.
The baseline kW/ton ratings measured in-situ were 
expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimations 
for 11 year old equipment. The post results are also in 
line with the average improvement savings shown 
over more than 120,000 installations globally.  
Cost Savings for Major US Warehouse Retailer when Implementing ECM Portfolio-wide in HVAC
The [Southeast Facility] is outfitted with 339 tons of HVAC, however nearly 100 tons of this cooling capacity is 
rarely if ever used. The amount of ECM required to treat this facility was 240 ounces. The average amount of 
tonnage per Major US Warehouse Retailer facility is likely closer to this amount or 240 ounces.
