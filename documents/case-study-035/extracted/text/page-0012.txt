Notes
The three pilot RTUs provide cooling across the 
front portion of the Major US Warehouse Retailer [Southeast Facility].  
Given the weather BIN data for 
[Florida Location]/[Southeast Location] region, the internal load of 
the facility combined with the hours of opera-
tions, internal refrigeration and the size and age 
of the RTUs, it is estimated that the RTUs each 
run approximately 3,500 hours or more
annually prior to the ECM being implemented.
