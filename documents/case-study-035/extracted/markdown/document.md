HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report

Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study

The purpose of this study is to verify the industry wide problem of efficiency loss in HVAC/R as projected by

ASHRAE research and to quantify the amount of money wasted due to this loss. Many industry leading

organizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age.

Thermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVACR equipment that operates as a

vapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well

documented by the HVACR industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal degradation

prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times and

additional kWh consumption.

The representative sample of equipment in this study is an agreed upon sampling that represents the portfolio

of equipment operated by Major US Warehouse Retailer. If thermal degradation is present in these machines it is present in the entire

inventory of equipment. Energy waste can be calculated based on this equipment (portfolio representation) and

then accurately extrapolated across the entire inventory of equipment.

Top image is one of the 19 HVAC Equipment Manufacturer RTUs (immediately above) supporting the Major US Warehouse Retailer [Southeast Facility]. Three of these RTU’s were forensically

tested using the IPMVP methodology to determine their performance capabilities.

Process

This comprehensive report contains specific information regarding the performance profiles of three of the 19

packaged roof top units (RTU’s) that support the Major US Warehouse Retailer facility in [Florida Location]. A second report will focus

on the substantial refrigeration plant in the store.

For this phase, detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the RTUs before (baseline)

and after (post) the installation of the ECM. This testing determined the impact on three key elements relating

to the original design specifications that greatly affect the HVAC portion of Major US Warehouse Retailer’s power bill. They include:

1.  The cooling capacity the RTUs are capable of producing after 11 years in service.

2.  The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the RTUs are delivering as reflected

in the kW/ton measurement.

3.  The thermal dynamic ability of the equipment to still perform at or close to operational design.

Methodology

The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the

IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework and the standards set forth by the

National Environmental Balancing Bureau (NEBB).

David Millard, Certified TAB Technician with Test & Balance Company A (T&B Company A),

recorded all of the pilot measurements while being observed by Powertron Global’s Director of

Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer]. The T&B Company A report is attached as Appendix A at the end of this report.

The baseline day chosen to test the RTU’s was an average day temperature and humidity-wise for the

[Florida Location] area which ensured repeatability of similar weather for the post testing measurements. The

weather conditions along with the weekday lunchtime crowds patronizing the facility provided an adequate

heat load on the facility to ensure all compressors would remain running during the actual data collection

period required for each. The boundary of the testing was each of the RTU’s and nothing else; therefore

confidence in the accuracy of the performance calculations is very high.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)

The content detailed in the first phase of this report will first demonstrate the ability of the three pilot RTUs to

perform prior to the ECM being installed, as well as illustrate the amount of thermal degradation within the

heat exchangers.

Following a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to determine the operational condition of the

systems was satisfactory, Baseline M&V data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. Approximately

one month after installation of the ECM, the M&V team returned on a very similar weather day to the Baseline

to take Post M&V measurements in the identical fashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements

and associated calculations show the amount of capacity restored.

The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan.

The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:

• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase)

• Ton = (Airflow * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta) / 12,000

• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage

• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)

Notes

The IPMVP data points were recorded and certified by the T&B Company A Certified TAB

Technician on 4 April 2014 and again on 8 May 2014 using recently calibrated

devices by NIST (National Institutes of Standards and Technology) to insure

measurement accuracy. The three RTUs were then treated with PermaFrost

NMR® following recording of the measurements on 4 April 2014 and allowed

to run normally until 8 May 2014 to ensure the patented surface science

nanotechnology ECM had ample time to seat into all the metal surfaces of the

heat exchangers. All measurements were taken at full load (all compressors

running) and at identical outdoor air temperatures and similar mid-day times

and numbers of shoppers.

To ensure the integrity of the data, the collection of the measurements in both

the baseline and post periods were conducted and recorded entirely by T&B Company A.

The measurements are listed below. The stamped recordation sheets are

provided in Appendix A.

Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results (across all 3 pilot units)

RTU Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM

Major US Warehouse Retailer has the problem of thermal degradation in its HVAC/R units. The low operating tonnage & COP

ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. The

degraded equipment performance is costing Major US Warehouse Retailer significant money and wasting energy. The equipment is

using significantly more kWh to operate than they did when they were new. The efficiency summary includes

all HVAC units measured, combining the current efficiency & tonnage of all units. This summary is the

cumulative impact of thermal degradation on the portfolio sampling.

The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 11.7 operating tons and an average

improvement of 26.5% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate.

Recovered Wasted Energy with ECM – 3 RTUs

The chart to the right illustrates the performance

restoration the ECM created in the treated RTUs.

The average cost to operate these RTUs before

they were treated with PermaFrost NMR® as

calculated in kW/ton was 1.38.

The specific cost to operate these RTUs after they

were been treated with PermaFrost NMR® as

calculated in kW/ton is currently 1.07.

The baseline kW/ton ratings measured in-situ were

expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of

performance efficiency and cost to operate estimations

for 11 year old equipment. The post results are also in

line with the average improvement savings shown

over more than 120,000 installations globally.

Cost Savings for Major US Warehouse Retailer when Implementing ECM Portfolio-wide in HVAC

The [Southeast Facility] is outfitted with 339 tons of HVAC, however nearly 100 tons of this cooling capacity is

rarely if ever used. The amount of ECM required to treat this facility was 240 ounces. The average amount of

tonnage per Major US Warehouse Retailer facility is likely closer to this amount or 240 ounces.

HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results

Calculated Eﬃciency of Major US Warehouse Retailer HVAC RTUs Baseline and Post

The chart below illustrates just how far off design the Major US Warehouse Retailer pilot RTUs (#3, #14 and #18) had degraded in

terms of efficiency over 11 years of use. These same three pilot RTUs were determined to be performing at an

average of 77.6% of the original design efficiency in the baseline. The actual design rated tonnage of each of the

RTUs is 15, 25 and 25 tons respectively, for a total of 65 tons. In actuality, the three RTUs were only producing a

total of 50.8 tons at the start of the pilot.  The majority of this 22.4% efficiency loss is directly attributable to the

thermal degradation of the heat exchange surfaces over a short period of time.

After the ECM was installed, the average efficiency in each of the RTUs jumped up to 95.6% of design

specifications, equating to 62.5 total tons. This represents a 23% increase in efficiency over the baseline

numbers.

HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results

Cost to Major US Warehouse Retailer to Operate the [Southeast Location] HVAC RTUs Baseline vs Post

The next chart illustrates the just how much money the efficiency performance loss in the pilot RTUs was

costing Major US Warehouse Retailer in the way of wasted energy each they were operating prior to the ECM. The average cost to

operate these three pilot RTUs as calculated in kW/ ton was 1.36 in the Baseline. When new, the kW/ton rating

for units like these usually ranges from .9 - 1.05 kW/ton. This means Major US Warehouse Retailer was paying up to 22.8% more than

design for energy to run the RTUs as a direct result of the baseline reduced level of performance. The kW/ton

ratings measured on site in [Southeast Location] were very much in line with the published ASHRAE loss of

performance averages.

The restored average kW/ton rating following the ECM is now 1.07. This represents a 21.3% reduction in

energy costs from the baseline for every ton of cooling produced. It also brings down the Major US Warehouse Retailer costs to

operate the RTUs to just 3% over design. This will result in an initial payback period to Major US Warehouse Retailer of

approximately 12-13 months. Over just a few years these accumulated savings will greatly reduce the eventual

CapEx costs to replace the RTUs when they finally reach the end of their useful life.

Return On Investment

The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR®

Post measurement period for the three Major US Warehouse Retailer Packaged RTUs.

Baseline Energy Consumption

Adjusted Baseline Tonnage: 50.8 tons

Adjusted kW Baseline: 1.36 kW/ton * 62.5 tons = 85 kW

Adjusted Baseline kWh: 85 kW * 3,500 Annual Operating Hrs = 297,500 kWh

Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 297,500 kWh * $.105 = $31,238

Post Energy Consumption

kW Post: 1.07 kW/ton * 62.5 tons = 66.88 kW

Annual kWh Post: 66.88 kW * 3,500 hours = 234,080 kWh

Annual Cost Post: 234,080 kWh * .105 cents = $24,578

Savings Per Year

Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $31,238 - $24,578 = $6,660

Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $6,660 / 12 = $555

Return On Investment

Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in three pilot RTUs: $6,663

Estimated ROI Period for Major US Warehouse Retailer on three RTUs: $6,663 / $555 = 12 months

Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period

for Major US Warehouse Retailer for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true

energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended

in the Avoided Energy Reporting (Post) Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems

was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity

and then subtracting the revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® ECM

was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of

hours the systems will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the

internal building set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.

Major US Warehouse Retailer is Saving More than just Energy

By treating the Major US Warehouse Retailer RTUs with PermaFrost NMR® and based on the current manner in which Major US Warehouse Retailer

operates these RTUs (i.e., the equivalent of 14 of the 19 units are being utilized on a regular basis to cover the

building load under normal conditions), the company will save approximately 295,633 kWh per year and all

the costs associated with those savings. From an environmental impact standpoint, Major US Warehouse Retailer is also benefitting

the surrounding community. Imagine how great the environmental impact will be when Major US Warehouse Retailer moves

forward with treating all their HVAC equipment across the USA.

The 295,633 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 204 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from

being released or any of the following:

Annual greenhouse emissions from:

PRETEST and FINAL REPORT
PROJECT SUMMARY

JOB # 7664
MAY 12, 2014

This project summary reflects the equipment operation and capacity status as of the

above date, which is the last day of testing at the site.

The following comments are based on report review and the field technician’s

observations.

SCOPE OF WORK

Our scope of work for this project was to pretest the three roof-top units for total air

volume, cooling coil performance test and static pressure across the ‘Dx’ coil prior to a

PermaFrost NMR insert.

After one month, a final test was performed to obtain the same data to determine BTUH

increase performance under the same conditions.
