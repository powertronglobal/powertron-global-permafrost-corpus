Patrick Amante, Electrical Supply Distributor Energy \nSolutions, personally witnessed all phases of the testing and data collection. \nThe two RTUs comprising this pilot project, one 90,000 \nBtu and the other 36,000 Btu, each utilize R-22 \nrefrigerant and were installed in 1998.  Based on BIN \ndata for Houston for all the hours per year over 65 \ndegrees, the units run 5,790 hours each year.  \nImmediately following the baseline testing, the units \nwere each treated with the proper amount of \nPermaFrost NMR® product specially formulated for \nR-22 DX systems.\nSince there were no other ECM’s going on during this \npilot project, the improvement in efficiency and \nrestored capacity gained directly at the units was \nsolely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  \nDespite much lower than design air flow across the \ncoils, both RTUs now provide colder supply air and \nmore Btu’s while using less watts per ton.  This greater \noperational efficiency is due to the restoration of the \nheat transfer ability of the evaporator and condenser \ncoils, less metal-to-metal friction and improved \nrefrigerant flow. \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\nEnergy Science Division\nSince the entering air temperature and discharge pressure were the same in both the baseline and post \nmeasurement periods, no adjustments for weather were required. \nFollowing treatment with PermaFrost NMR®, the pilot units showed an average 13.5% reduction in both \ntotal Watts and Watts/Ton while at the same time producing an increase in capacity of 19,931 Btu’s or \n18.9%. The unit also showed an improvement in EER of 15.8%.  Additionally, the pilot unit showed an \naverage of 18.4% improvement in enthalpy delta which is another scientific way to view the thermodynamic \nenhancement of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result of the average ECM improvements is an ROI to \nElectrical Supply Distributor of 11 months.

A \nsustainable, one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining \nlife of any type of system in which it is installed – DX (direct expansion air and chilled water systems), \nchillers (screw, reciprocating, scroll and centrifugal), heat pumps and ice making equipment.  \nSpecialized applications include computer room cooling and dehumidification systems, chiller plants \n(water and ice production applications), domestic and industrial refrigeration (ammonia low and ultra \nlow temperature), air-cooled single application water chillers and split and package rooftop HVAC \nequipment.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and \nimproved refrigerant velocity – all of which allows a system to achieve set point temperatures in a more \nrapid fashion which reduces system loading and operating periods.  The indirect benefits resulting \nfrom the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less \nkW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor per ton, less metallic wear, longer overall equipment \nlife and a reduced carbon footprint for Electrical Supply Distributor.\nEnergy Science Division\nOIL BUILD-UP\nOIL REMOVED\nBEFORE TREATMENT\nAFTER TREATMENT\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 457, "chars": 2168, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_055_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_055_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:a8f629c2735e7af96177ed7a4fb12d6a723570b08015d9c487763d916d7c622b"}

Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.\nRetrofit Isolation (Option B) is defined as: All parameter measurement with the boundary of the ECM \n(PermaFrost NMR®) as the single source of measurement.  Savings are determined by field measurement of \nthe energy use of the energy conservation method affected equipment or system and any performance \nenhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained.  The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using \nmeasurements of proxies of energy use.\nThe final computation follows the formula:\nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+ - Routine adjustments + - Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 448, "chars": 2219, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_055_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_055_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:b1636d67b1fb2fb059073e405a0259425443c44e0dc78926691f0167a9e6c07a"}
