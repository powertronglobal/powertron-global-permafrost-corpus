Performance Report on PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Electrical Supply Distributor
March, 2013
Executive Summary
        This report contains specific information regarding the detailed forensic performance testing (outlined 
later in this report) of the energy control measure (ECM) PermaFrost NMR® in two of the many packaged 
roof top units (RTUs) supporting the Electrical Supply Distributor facility in [Texas City].  Patrick Amante, Electrical Supply Distributor Energy 
Solutions, personally witnessed all phases of the testing and data collection. 
The two RTUs comprising this pilot project, one 90,000 
Btu and the other 36,000 Btu, each utilize R-22 
refrigerant and were installed in 1998.  Based on BIN 
data for Houston for all the hours per year over 65 
degrees, the units run 5,790 hours each year.  
Immediately following the baseline testing, the units 
were each treated with the proper amount of 
PermaFrost NMR® product specially formulated for 
R-22 DX systems.
Since there were no other ECM’s going on during this 
pilot project, the improvement in efficiency and 
restored capacity gained directly at the units was 
solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  
Despite much lower than design air flow across the 
coils, both RTUs now provide colder supply air and 
more Btu’s while using less watts per ton.  This greater 
operational efficiency is due to the restoration of the 
heat transfer ability of the evaporator and condenser 
coils, less metal-to-metal friction and improved 
refrigerant flow.

Since the entering air temperature and discharge pressure were the same in both the baseline and post 
measurement periods, no adjustments for weather were required. 
Following treatment with PermaFrost NMR®, the pilot units showed an average 13.5% reduction in both 
total Watts and Watts/Ton while at the same time producing an increase in capacity of 19,931 Btu’s or 
18.9%. The unit also showed an improvement in EER of 15.8%.  Additionally, the pilot unit showed an 
average of 18.4% improvement in enthalpy delta which is another scientific way to view the thermodynamic 
enhancement of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result of the average ECM improvements is an ROI to 
Electrical Supply Distributor of 11 months.  The tables of data and financial calculations are available for review at the end of this 
report.

Product Brief
         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control 
Measure (ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR®) technology as its core agent. A 
sustainable, one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining 
life of any type of system in which it is installed – DX (direct expansion air and chilled water systems), 
chillers (screw, reciprocating, scroll and centrifugal), heat pumps and ice making equipment.  
Specialized applications include computer room cooling and dehumidification systems, chiller plants 
(water and ice production applications), domestic and industrial refrigeration (ammonia low and ultra 
low temperature), air-cooled single application water chillers and split and package rooftop HVAC 
equipment.
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and 
improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allows a system to achieve set point temperatures in a more 
rapid fashion which reduces system loading and operating periods.  The indirect benefits resulting 
from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less 
kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor per ton, less metallic wear, longer overall equipment 
life and a reduced carbon footprint for Electrical Supply Distributor.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) is used to develop this 
report.  The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and 
Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the 
IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and 
products.
There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize.  They 
are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.
Retrofit Isolation (Option B) is defined as: All parameter measurement with the boundary of the ECM 
(PermaFrost NMR®) as the single source of measurement.  Savings are determined by field measurement of 
the energy use of the energy conservation method affected equipment or system and any performance 
enhancements versus the baseline data.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term 
measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained.  The savings are calculated by 
short-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using 
measurements of proxies of energy use.
The final computation follows the formula:
The final computation follows the formula:

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content of the following report will demonstrate the effects of PermaFrost NMR®’s ability to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces. 
A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if they were both in 
satisfactory operational condition.  Baseline measurements were recorded and then the proper amount and 
type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected.  The product was then allowed three months over the winter to 
seat into the metal surfaces before the exact same post measurements were taken again to establish the 
efficiency gains. 
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) was utilized as the M&V 
plan.  The measurements and final calculations were performed and certified by Powertron Global’s Senior 
Energy Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer], ME/CEM/CMC/CMVP.
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
kW = Volts X Amps * .9 Single Phase or 1.47 Three Phase / 1000
 
Delta T = Return Air DB – Supply Air DB
 
Refrigerant Approach = Supply Air DB – Saturated Evaporator Temp
 
Enthalpy =  Return Air WB Deg. F and Supply Air WB Deg. F Converted to Enthalpy
 
Actual Btuh Capacity = Measured CFM X 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta 
 
System Eﬃciency % = Actual Coil Capacity Btuh / Nominal Coil Capacity Btuh

Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to determine a very accurate ROI for 
Electrical Supply Distributor for implementing this ECM:
Baseline kWh = (10,039 BCTW / 1,000) * 5,790 Annual Operating Hrs = 58,126 BkWh  
Baseline Cost To Run = 52,126 BkWh * $.10 = $5,813
Regression Analysis is then used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Pilot Unit  
Adjusted Base Tonnage = 7.21 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted Base Total Watts = 1,693 BWPT * 7.21 tons = 12,207 ABTW
Adjusted Base kWh = (12,207 ABTW/1,000) * 5,790 Annual Operating Hrs = 70,679 ABkWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM = 70,679 ABkWh * $.10 = $7,068
Post ECM kWh = (10,209 PCTW / 1,000) * 5,790 Annual Operating Hrs = 59,110 PkWh
Cost to Run After ECM = 59,110 PkWh * $.10 = $5,911
Cost Savings per Month = ($7,068 - $5,911) / 12 = $96.42
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed 8 oz. @ $125 / $96.42 = 10.4
 
ROI = 10.4 months
