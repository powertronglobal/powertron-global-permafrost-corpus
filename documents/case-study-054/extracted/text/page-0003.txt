Since the entering air temperature and discharge pressure were the same in both the baseline and post 
measurement periods, no adjustments for weather were required. 
Following treatment with PermaFrost NMR®, the pilot units showed an average 13.5% reduction in both 
total Watts and Watts/Ton while at the same time producing an increase in capacity of 19,931 Btu’s or 
18.9%. The unit also showed an improvement in EER of 15.8%.  Additionally, the pilot unit showed an 
average of 18.4% improvement in enthalpy delta which is another scientific way to view the thermodynamic 
enhancement of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result of the average ECM improvements is an ROI to 
Electrical Supply Distributor of 11 months.  The tables of data and financial calculations are available for review at the end of this 
report.
