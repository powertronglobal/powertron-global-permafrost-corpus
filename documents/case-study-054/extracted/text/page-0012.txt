Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to determine a very accurate ROI for 
Electrical Supply Distributor for implementing this ECM:
Baseline kWh = (5,424 BCTW / 1,000) * 5,790 Annual Operating Hrs = 31,405 BkWh
Baseline Cost To Run = 31,405 BkWh * $.10 = $3,141
Regression Analysis is then used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Pilot Unit  
Adjusted Base Tonnage = 2.75 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted Base Total Watts = 2,298 BWPT * 2.75 tons = 6,320 ABTW
Adjusted Base kWh = (6,320 ABTW/1,000) * 5,790 Annual Operating Hrs = 36,593 ABkWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM = 36,593 ABkWh * $.10 = $3,659
Post ECM kWh = (5,636 PCTW / 1,000) * 5,790 Annual Operating Hrs = 32,650 PkWh
Cost to Run After ECM = 32,650 PkWh * $.10 = $3,265
Cost Savings per Month = ($3,659 - $3,265) / 12 = $32.83
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed 3 oz. @ $125 / $32.83 = 11.4
 
ROI = 11.4 months
