Performance Report on PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Electrical Supply Distributor
March, 2013
Executive Summary
        This report contains specific information regarding the detailed forensic performance testing (outlined 
later in this report) of the energy control measure (ECM) PermaFrost NMR® in two of the many packaged 
roof top units (RTUs) supporting the Electrical Supply Distributor facility in [Texas City].  Patrick Amante, Electrical Supply Distributor Energy 
Solutions, personally witnessed all phases of the testing and data collection. 
The two RTUs comprising this pilot project, one 90,000 
Btu and the other 36,000 Btu, each utilize R-22 
refrigerant and were installed in 1998.  Based on BIN 
data for Houston for all the hours per year over 65 
degrees, the units run 5,790 hours each year.  
Immediately following the baseline testing, the units 
were each treated with the proper amount of 
PermaFrost NMR® product specially formulated for 
R-22 DX systems.
Since there were no other ECM’s going on during this 
pilot project, the improvement in efficiency and 
restored capacity gained directly at the units was 
solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  
Despite much lower than design air flow across the 
coils, both RTUs now provide colder supply air and 
more Btu’s while using less watts per ton.  This greater 
operational efficiency is due to the restoration of the 
heat transfer ability of the evaporator and condenser 
coils, less metal-to-metal friction and improved 
refrigerant flow.
