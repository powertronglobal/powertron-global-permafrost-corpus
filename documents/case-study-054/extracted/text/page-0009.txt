Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to determine a very accurate ROI for 
Electrical Supply Distributor for implementing this ECM:
Baseline kWh = (10,039 BCTW / 1,000) * 5,790 Annual Operating Hrs = 58,126 BkWh  
Baseline Cost To Run = 52,126 BkWh * $.10 = $5,813
Regression Analysis is then used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Pilot Unit  
Adjusted Base Tonnage = 7.21 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted Base Total Watts = 1,693 BWPT * 7.21 tons = 12,207 ABTW
Adjusted Base kWh = (12,207 ABTW/1,000) * 5,790 Annual Operating Hrs = 70,679 ABkWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM = 70,679 ABkWh * $.10 = $7,068
Post ECM kWh = (10,209 PCTW / 1,000) * 5,790 Annual Operating Hrs = 59,110 PkWh
Cost to Run After ECM = 59,110 PkWh * $.10 = $5,911
Cost Savings per Month = ($7,068 - $5,911) / 12 = $96.42
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed 8 oz. @ $125 / $96.42 = 10.4
 
ROI = 10.4 months
