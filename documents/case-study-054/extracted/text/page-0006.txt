Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content of the following report will demonstrate the effects of PermaFrost NMR®’s ability to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces. 
A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if they were both in 
satisfactory operational condition.  Baseline measurements were recorded and then the proper amount and 
type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected.  The product was then allowed three months over the winter to 
seat into the metal surfaces before the exact same post measurements were taken again to establish the 
efficiency gains. 
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) was utilized as the M&V 
plan.  The measurements and final calculations were performed and certified by Powertron Global’s Senior 
Energy Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer], ME/CEM/CMC/CMVP.
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
kW = Volts X Amps * .9 Single Phase or 1.47 Three Phase / 1000
 
Delta T = Return Air DB – Supply Air DB
 
Refrigerant Approach = Supply Air DB – Saturated Evaporator Temp
 
Enthalpy =  Return Air WB Deg. F and Supply Air WB Deg. F Converted to Enthalpy
 
Actual Btuh Capacity = Measured CFM X 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta 
 
System Eﬃciency % = Actual Coil Capacity Btuh / Nominal Coil Capacity Btuh
