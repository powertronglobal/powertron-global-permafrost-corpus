A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any \ntype of system in which it is installed – DX (direct expansion air and chilled water systems), Chillers \n(screw, reciprocating, scroll and centrifugal), heat pumps, ice making equipment.  Specialized \napplications include computer room cooling and dehumidification systems, chiller plants (water and ice \nproduction applications), domestic and industrial refrigeration (ammonia low and ultra low \ntemperature), air-cooled single application water chillers and split and package rooftop HVAC \nequipment.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity, and \nimproved refrigerant velocity – all of which allows a system to achieve set point temperatures in a more \nrapid fashion that reduces system loading and operating periods.  The indirect benefits resulting from \nthe enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW \nhours used, less amp draw at the compressor, less metallic wear and longer overall equipment life.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 469, "chars": 2244, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_106_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:0635a5f67d2d81b581bb50fe91735a49d8eb9c1ccad9077aa3b6385f5253a1a9"}

These two representatives \nwere supported by The Company’s on-site contractor engineering support personnel.\nIn summary, The Company’s chiller treated with the PermaFrost NMR® ECM showed an 18.6% reduction \nin kW; a 12% reduction in required operating tonnage to deliver setpoint; a 7.6% reduction in kW/ton; an \n8.2% improvement in COP; a 56.8% improvement in refrigerant approach.\nThe chiller required 82% load in the post versus 100% load in the baseline to arrive at chilled water setpoint. \nAttempts were made to reach 100% load, however this chiller now has the ability to handle the complete \nload of the facility while operating at 82%.\nThis pilot machine provides chilled water at the measured GPM and now delivers design chilled water \noutlet setpoint temperature at reduced kWh while increasing tonnage per kW efficiency.  This allows the \nchiller to produce more tonnage while consuming less energy. The introduction of PermaFrost NMR® has \nrestored a significant amount of chilled water capacity to support this critical facility which has resulted in \nmuch lower operational costs. \nBased on the data collected, the return on investment (ROI) for this ECM is just 4 months.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 490, "chars": 2257, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_106_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_106_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:0e55f6fe4bcc9858da445b072046876bd96a2f474545fd7df6bf28de7c62162d"}

Option B is \ndefined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single \nsource of measurement within the equipment that was affected.\nSavings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM affected equipment or system \nand any performance enhancements versus the baseline data prior to the ECM.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B, short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained.  The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using \nmeasurements of proxies of energy use.\nThe final computation follows the formula below:\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+ - Routine adjustments + - Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 454, "chars": 2230, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_106_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_106_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:549e29738f9e47fda470b6b4de1a6b1ca1e9d084f83d5fa59d1d5f7265e55c3f"}

Prior to the introduction of PermaFrost NMR®, this chiller was introduced to a full load \ntest.  This test determined the operational characteristics of the chiller’s ability to reach full load of design \nand performance.  The test also recorded the machine’s energy consumption while sustained at that load \nwithout load variance.  The outdoor air temperature during the baseline-testing period was 77 degrees and \nthe set point of the chiller was adjusted to 43 degrees.  Chiller load was attributable to directing the energy \nmanagement system to command all chilled water valves in the air handler directory to the 100% open \nposition for the duration of this data gathering exercise. \nThe machine loaded the compressor to 100% load while consuming 430 amps of electrical energy.  Note that \nthis chiller was unable to attain the desired chilled water set point of 43 degrees during the baseline \nenergy-testing period as full load limits were reached before the chilled water set point was achieved.  Also \nnote that due to the energy load on the compressor, this machine was limited to the development of 381 \ntons during this phase of the baseline test.\nAfter the baseline testing, data was cataloged and PermaFrost NMR® was introduced into the suction and \ncondensed liquid refrigerant inlet service ports.  This machine was then operated for a period of 28 days to \nprovide the gestation period necessary for PermaFrost NMR® to absorb into all heat exchange surfaces.\nSubsequent to the baseline test period for determining chiller performance and energy consumption, a \nreplication of conditions were developed to determine the avoided cost of performance and operating levels \n(post testing period).  The outdoor temperature during this post-test was slightly warmer at 79 degrees and \nthe set point was again adjusted to 43 degrees.  Once again, chiller load was attributable to directing the \nenergy management system to command all chilled water valves in the air handler directory to the 100% \nopen position for the duration of the post or (avoided energy) data gathering period of this exercise (or test). \nThis is the identical load profile used for the baseline-testing period of the ECM.  Note that load was slightly \ngreater than the baseline-reporting period due to the outdoor air temperature being higher.  No adjustments \nwere made in the baseline reading to reflect this increase in outdoor air temperature so as to reflect \nconfidence in the energy savings produced.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 659, "chars": 3283, "pages": {"start": 8, "end": 9}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_106_chunk_0006", "next_id": "pdf_106_chunk_0008", "content_hash": "sha256:77cb1b55ee0f9e60c1edd61772455c6ac9090f511285273f0c2c0954f3fcdeab"}

Special notation should be made to the tonnage required to attain chilled water set point \nwhile using less electrical energy.  This is the tonnage that was required to deliver the chilled water set \npoint.  While attaining the chilled water set point of 43 degrees, this machine only required the net \nrefrigeration affect of 280 tons.  This is the result of the ECM enhancing the ability of the heat exchange \nsurfaces of the chiller evaporator and condenser to transfer kinetic heat energy. \nAs previously reported, all attempts were made to assure load stability for the baseline and avoided energy \nreporting periods.  All internal chilled water valves serving air handlers were digitally controlled to open fully \nto the 100% operating position during the pre and post measurement periods.  While it is always a concern to \ncreate similar operating conditions to generate examples of baseline energy consumption versus avoided \nenergy reporting periods, this machine was driven to the maximum operating limits of the connected load.\nMeasurement confidence was confirmed that the avoided energy-reporting period was in excess of the \nchilled water load conditions experienced during the baseline-reporting period.  \nThis pilot machine provides chilled water at the measured GPM and now delivers design chilled water \noutlet set point temperature at reduced kWh while increasing tonnage per kW efficiency.  This allows the \nchiller to produce more tonnage while consuming less energy.  The introduction of PermaFrost NMR® has \nrestored a significant amount of chilled water capacity to support this critical Company facility, which has \nresulted in much lower operational costs. \nBaseline Period 5/30/12                           Post Treatment Period 6/27/12\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\nEnergy Science Division\nCertiﬁcation\n[Engineering Consultant], P.E., for EET reviewed the testing and data collection methodology used in this pilot \nand attests to the integrity and accuracy of the data pre and post PermaFrost NMR® treatment.\nPlace P.E.
