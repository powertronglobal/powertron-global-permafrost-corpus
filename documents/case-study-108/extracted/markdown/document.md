Product Brief

PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface science Energy Control Measure

(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) technology as its core agent.  A sustainable,

one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any

type of system in which it is installed – DX (direct expansion air and chilled water systems), Chillers

(screw, reciprocating, scroll and centrifugal), heat pumps, ice making equipment.  Specialized

applications include computer room cooling and dehumidification systems, chiller plants (water and ice

production applications), domestic and industrial refrigeration (ammonia low and ultra low

temperature), air-cooled single application water chillers and split and package rooftop HVAC

equipment.

The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity, and

improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allows a system to achieve set point temperatures in a more

rapid fashion that reduces system loading and operating periods.  The indirect benefits resulting from

the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW

hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, less metallic wear and longer overall equipment life.

Executive Summary

This report contains specific information regarding the installation of PermaFrost NMR® in a Carrier

Evergreen 510-ton Centrifugal Chiller supporting a mission-critical data center for a U.S. Communications

Company (heretofore referred to as The Company) located in Long Island, New York.

Two Company representatives, one from Network Engineering and the other from Power and Energy

Planning section of the Global Real Estate Department, managed this entire trial.  These two representatives

were supported by The Company’s on-site contractor engineering support personnel.

In summary, The Company’s chiller treated with the PermaFrost NMR® ECM showed an 18.6% reduction

in kW; a 12% reduction in required operating tonnage to deliver setpoint; a 7.6% reduction in kW/ton; an

8.2% improvement in COP; a 56.8% improvement in refrigerant approach.

The chiller required 82% load in the post versus 100% load in the baseline to arrive at chilled water setpoint.

Attempts were made to reach 100% load, however this chiller now has the ability to handle the complete

load of the facility while operating at 82%.

This pilot machine provides chilled water at the measured GPM and now delivers design chilled water

outlet setpoint temperature at reduced kWh while increasing tonnage per kW efficiency.  This allows the

chiller to produce more tonnage while consuming less energy. The introduction of PermaFrost NMR® has

restored a significant amount of chilled water capacity to support this critical facility which has resulted in

much lower operational costs.

Based on the data collected, the return on investment (ROI) for this ECM is just 4 months.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol IPMVP

The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocols (IPMVP) were used as the basis to

develop this report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration

and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and the Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) all accept the

IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and

products.

There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize.  They

are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.  Option B is

defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single

source of measurement within the equipment that was affected.

Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM affected equipment or system

and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data prior to the ECM.

Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the

savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B, short-term

measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained.  The savings are calculated by

short-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using

measurements of proxies of energy use.

The final computation follows the formula below:

Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy

+ - Routine adjustments + - Non-Routine Adjustments

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content

The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the

effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces.

After consulting with Company personnel involved in the test, it was determined to treat this particular

chiller since it serves as the primary chiller in the facility.  A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment

was implemented to determine if the unit’s operational conditions were satisfactory.  Baseline

measurements were recorded and then the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected. The

product was then allowed 28 days to seat itself into the metal surfaces before post measurements were taken

to establish the efficiency gains.

The chiller was started and 100% load was attained by having the EMS command the opening all of the

chilled water valves for the entire data-gathering period.  This data gathering baseline period did not

contain variables of any consequence to alter the data.  The team waited 15 minutes before starting to record

data to allow the chiller to stabilize fully. During this 15 minute wait period, the following parameters were

recorded:

Chiller kW; Chilled Water Delta T; Condenser Water Delta T; Condensed Liquid Refrigerant Temperature;

Saturated (Suction) Evaporator Refrigerant Temperature; Operating Tonnage; kW per Ton and COP.

The results of the above readings were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic

engineering formulas:

•  To determine the kW, voltage, amperage and power factor, the team utilized data from the chiller digital

and analog instrumentation for pre and post measurement. Those data streams were verified by the manual

calculation for determining kW energy as:

Volts * Amps * .85 * 1.56 / 1000

•  To determine the actual GPM the following formula was utilized:

GPM2 = GPM * Measured Pressure Drop (ft) / by Design Pressure Drop (ft) (sqd)

•  To determine the Actual Cooling Tons per Hour the following formula was utilized:

Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU

• To determine the Operating kW per Ton the following formula was utilized:

Actual kW / Actual Tonnage

• To determine the actual COP the following formula was utilized:

12 / kW per ton / 3.412

• To determine Refrigerant Approach the following formula was utilized:

Supply Water Temp – Saturated Evaporator Temp

The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global’s Senior Engineer [Senior Energy Engineer]

ME/CEM/CMC/CMVP.  All baseline and avoided energy period notes and manual readings were

provided to The Company personnel while on site each time in order to maintain the integrity of the data.

Photos were also taken as additional verification.

Conclusion

The resulting improvements in the performance efficiency of the chiller generated by the ECM are deemed

to be substantial.  Prior to the introduction of PermaFrost NMR®, this chiller was introduced to a full load

test.  This test determined the operational characteristics of the chiller’s ability to reach full load of design

and performance.  The test also recorded the machine’s energy consumption while sustained at that load

without load variance.  The outdoor air temperature during the baseline-testing period was 77 degrees and

the set point of the chiller was adjusted to 43 degrees.  Chiller load was attributable to directing the energy

management system to command all chilled water valves in the air handler directory to the 100% open

position for the duration of this data gathering exercise.

The machine loaded the compressor to 100% load while consuming 430 amps of electrical energy.  Note that

this chiller was unable to attain the desired chilled water set point of 43 degrees during the baseline

energy-testing period as full load limits were reached before the chilled water set point was achieved.  Also

note that due to the energy load on the compressor, this machine was limited to the development of 381

tons during this phase of the baseline test.

After the baseline testing, data was cataloged and PermaFrost NMR® was introduced into the suction and

condensed liquid refrigerant inlet service ports.  This machine was then operated for a period of 28 days to

provide the gestation period necessary for PermaFrost NMR® to absorb into all heat exchange surfaces.

Subsequent to the baseline test period for determining chiller performance and energy consumption, a

replication of conditions were developed to determine the avoided cost of performance and operating levels

(post testing period).  The outdoor temperature during this post-test was slightly warmer at 79 degrees and

the set point was again adjusted to 43 degrees.  Once again, chiller load was attributable to directing the

energy management system to command all chilled water valves in the air handler directory to the 100%

open position for the duration of the post or (avoided energy) data gathering period of this exercise (or test).

This is the identical load profile used for the baseline-testing period of the ECM.  Note that load was slightly

greater than the baseline-reporting period due to the outdoor air temperature being higher.  No adjustments

were made in the baseline reading to reflect this increase in outdoor air temperature so as to reflect

confidence in the energy savings produced.

The machine loaded the compressor to 82% while attaining the chilled water set point of 43 degrees.

During this performance improvement period, the energy consumption was reduced from 430 amps to 350

amps (see photos).  Special notation should be made to the tonnage required to attain chilled water set point

while using less electrical energy.  This is the tonnage that was required to deliver the chilled water set

point.  While attaining the chilled water set point of 43 degrees, this machine only required the net

refrigeration affect of 280 tons.  This is the result of the ECM enhancing the ability of the heat exchange

surfaces of the chiller evaporator and condenser to transfer kinetic heat energy.

As previously reported, all attempts were made to assure load stability for the baseline and avoided energy

reporting periods.  All internal chilled water valves serving air handlers were digitally controlled to open fully

to the 100% operating position during the pre and post measurement periods.  While it is always a concern to

create similar operating conditions to generate examples of baseline energy consumption versus avoided

energy reporting periods, this machine was driven to the maximum operating limits of the connected load.

Measurement confidence was confirmed that the avoided energy-reporting period was in excess of the

chilled water load conditions experienced during the baseline-reporting period.

This pilot machine provides chilled water at the measured GPM and now delivers design chilled water

outlet set point temperature at reduced kWh while increasing tonnage per kW efficiency.  This allows the

chiller to produce more tonnage while consuming less energy.  The introduction of PermaFrost NMR® has

restored a significant amount of chilled water capacity to support this critical Company facility, which has

resulted in much lower operational costs.
