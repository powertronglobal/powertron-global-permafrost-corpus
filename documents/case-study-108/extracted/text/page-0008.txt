Results
The following results are based off of the Baseline Measurement of data and the Energy Reporting Period.
kW per ton Baseline = .86 kW/ton * 318 tons = 274 kW
kW per ton Energy Reporting Period = .79 kW/ton * 280 tons = 223 kW
Annual kWh Baseline 274 kW * 4717 hours = 1,290,978.75 kWh
Annual Cost Baseline = 1,290,978.75 kWh * .16 cents = $206,556.60
Annual kWh Energy Reporting Period 223 kW * 4717 hours = 1,050,796.66 kWh
Annual Cost Energy Reporting Period = 1,050,796.66 kWh * .16 cents = $168,127.46
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Month = $3,202.43
Cost of PermaFrost NMR™ installed @ $12,875 / $3,202.43 = 4 months
