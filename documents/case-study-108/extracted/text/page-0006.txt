•  To determine the Actual Cooling Tons per Hour the following formula was utilized:
 
Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU
• To determine the Operating kW per Ton the following formula was utilized:
 
Actual kW / Actual Tonnage
• To determine the actual COP the following formula was utilized:
 
12 / kW per ton / 3.412
• To determine Refrigerant Approach the following formula was utilized:
 
Supply Water Temp – Saturated Evaporator Temp
The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global’s Senior Engineer [Senior Energy Engineer] 
ME/CEM/CMC/CMVP.  All baseline and avoided energy period notes and manual readings were 
provided to The Company personnel while on site each time in order to maintain the integrity of the data. 
Photos were also taken as additional verification.
