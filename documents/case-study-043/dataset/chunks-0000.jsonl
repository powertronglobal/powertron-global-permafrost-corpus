Many industry leading \norganizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age. \nThermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVACR equipment that operates as a \nvapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well \ndocumented by the HVACR industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal degradation \nprevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times and additional \nkWh consumption.\nThe DX unit in this study is representative of 40% of the equipment operated by Municipal School District ISD. If thermal \ndegradation is present in this DX unit, it is present in the entire inventory of the DX equipment. Energy waste \ncan be calculated based on this unit (portfolio representation) and then accurately extrapolated across the\nentire inventory of DX equipment if average age of equipment is known.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 558, "chars": 2590, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_045_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:1a87e8e05b5f91a389100aa6bd206669f9b4f67eba74574d71722018b4224976"}

The cooling capacity the DX unit is capable of producing after 10 years in service. \n \n2.  The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the DX unit is delivering as \n \n     reflected in the kW/ton measurement. \n \n3.  The thermal dynamic ability of the DX unit to still perform at or close to operational design.\nMethodology\nThe measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the \nIPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted of Powertron \nGlobal’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer] and [Principal Engineer], Principal Engineer for ESA Energy \nSystems Associates, Inc. [Principal Engineer] was acting as the Municipal School District ISD Commissioner, overseeing the Project for \nMunicipal School District ISD. Several members of the Municipal School District ISD Maintenance team participated in the testing process and were a \ngreat help with their intricate knowledge of the nuances associated with the pilot unit.\nThe baseline day chosen to test the RTU was an average day temperature and humidity-wise for the Austin, \nTX area which ensured repeatability of similar weather for the post testing measurements. The boundary of \nthe testing was each of the RTU and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance \ncalculations is very high.\nNotes \nThe unit measured serviced the main High School Gymnasium hallway. The DX unit tested was found to have a faulty \npulley and had to be stabilized before we could start the baseline. Both the baseline and post measurements were taken \nwith outside air temperatures of 88 degrees. \nThe boundary of the testing was the DX unit and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance \ncalculations is very high.\n \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 584, "chars": 2933, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_045_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_045_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:fe70b531a3a49f7e8e224ae3f140cda6ad8e0e3f39e59f888a8f74092ed919f0"}

The report will also illustrate the amount of thermal \ndegradation that has occurred due in large part to thermal degradation within the heat exchangers and how much of \nthat has been restored.\n \nThe following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. \nThe results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:\n \n• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) \n \n• Tons = (Airflow * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta) / 12,000 \n \n• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage \n \n• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)\n \n• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Air Temp – Saturated Suction Temp\nNotes \nFollowing a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to determine the operational condition of the system was \nsatisfactory, Baseline M&V data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. Four hundred runtime hours after \ninstallation of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, the M&V team returned on a very similar weather day to the Baseline to \ntake Post M&V measurements in the identical fashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements and associated \ncalculations show the amount of capacity restored.\nThe following IPMVP data points were recorded on 3 June 2014 using recently calibrated devices by NIST (National \nInstitutes of Standards and Technology) to insure measurement accuracy. The DX unit was then treated with \nPermaFrost NMR® on the same day and allowed to run until 6 August 2014 to ensure the patented surface science \nnanotechnology had ample time to seat into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All measurements were taken at \n100% load and at similar return air and outdoor air temperatures. \nThe collection of the data in both the baseline and post periods was collected by Powertron Global® under the watchful eye \nof Municipal School District ISD technicians and [Principal Engineer], of Energy Consulting Partner. The Municipal School District ISD technicians, maintain the unit \nand [Principal Engineer] oversaw the Project for Municipal School District ISD. \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 643, "chars": 2878, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_045_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_045_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:fecc8f9e2227adec0db62aac67f10ae07037b318e41ab96a9d698ea422f94bd6"}

The average cost to operate this unit as calculated in kW/ ton was 1.81 in the Baseline. When new, the \nkW/ton rating for units like these usually range from 1.0-1.2 kW/ton. This means West Lake HS/Municipal School District ISD \nwas paying up to 37% more than design for energy to run the DX unit as a direct result of the baseline reduced \nlevel of performance. The kW/ton ratings measured on site in Austin, Texas were very much in line with the \nASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers.\n  \nThe restored average kW/ton rating following the ECM is now 1.14. This represents a 37% reduction in energy \ncosts from the baseline for every ton of cooling produced. It also brings down the West Lake HS/Municipal School District ISD \ncosts to operate the unit to just above design. This will result in an initial payback period to West Lake \nHS/Municipal School District ISD of approximately 7.3 months.

Not only will the \nsystem last longer because it runs less (by reaching set-point temperatures faster), but PermaFrost NMR® is \nalso proven to increase lubricity above the OEM oil and it also includes preventative maintenance measures \nsuch as anti-humectants, acid scavengers, as well as seal/bearing conditioners - all of which contribute to the \nlife extension of the equipment. Considering Municipal School District ISD's process of acquiring new HVAC assets (via bonds), \nMunicipal School District ISD can now reconsider future bond amounts by delaying the replacement of some units, reducing the \namount required to fund new capital equipment.\nMunicipal School District ISD can also expect an improvement in indoor air quality by reducing humidity levels due to the \nefficiency restoration. Lower humidity levels also help reduce the potential for mold, mildew, etc. The drop \nin humidity can allow Municipal School District ISD to operate at a higher thermostat setting by one to three degrees, while \nkeeping comfort levels unchanged and drive the kWh savings even further. \nNot only will Municipal School District ISD will be making significant progress towards exceeding efficiency goals by \nimplementing PermaFrost NMR®, it will also help solidify their role as a leader in sustainability and \nenvironmental stewardship by making a meaningful reduction to their carbon footprint. When calculated \nover several years a PermaFrost NMR® implementation can free up large amounts of capital for Municipal School District ISD - \nthe total savings which include energy savings, maintenance savings, extended equipment life, reduced \ndemand charges, etc. are significant.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 827, "chars": 3960, "pages": {"start": 10, "end": 12}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_045_chunk_0008", "next_id": "", "content_hash": "sha256:b7bf21d06a1f861a98de76babd807c0bf04aa23f1e96c3d19ab393042c37421b"}
