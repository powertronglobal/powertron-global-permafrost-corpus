HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report
Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study
The purpose of this study is to verify the industry wide problem of efficiency loss in HVAC/R as projected by 
ASHRAE research and to quantify the amount of money wasted due to this loss. Many industry leading 
organizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age. 
Thermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVACR equipment that operates as a 
vapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well 
documented by the HVACR industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal degradation 
prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times and additional 
kWh consumption.
The DX unit in this study is representative of 40% of the equipment operated by Municipal School District ISD. If thermal 
degradation is present in this DX unit, it is present in the entire inventory of the DX equipment. Energy waste 
can be calculated based on this unit (portfolio representation) and then accurately extrapolated across the
entire inventory of DX equipment if average age of equipment is known.

Process
This report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of one of dozens of DX 
units that support the West Lake High School Campus in Austin, Texas. 
Detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the pilot DX unit before and after 
the installation of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM to determine the impact on the three key elements that greatly 
affect Municipal School District ISD HVAC power bill as they relate to the original design specifications: 
 
1.  The cooling capacity the DX unit is capable of producing after 10 years in service. 
 
2.  The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the DX unit is delivering as 
 
     reflected in the kW/ton measurement. 
 
3.  The thermal dynamic ability of the DX unit to still perform at or close to operational design.
Methodology
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the 
IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted of Powertron 
Global’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer] and [Principal Engineer], Principal Engineer for ESA Energy 
Systems Associates, Inc. [Principal Engineer] was acting as the Municipal School District ISD Commissioner, overseeing the Project for 
Municipal School District ISD. Several members of the Municipal School District ISD Maintenance team participated in the testing process and were a 
great help with their intricate knowledge of the nuances associated with the pilot unit.
The baseline day chosen to test the RTU was an average day temperature and humidity-wise for the Austin, 
TX area which ensured repeatability of similar weather for the post testing measurements. The boundary of 
the testing was each of the RTU and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance 
calculations is very high.
Notes 
The unit measured serviced the main High School Gymnasium hallway. The DX unit tested was found to have a faulty 
pulley and had to be stabilized before we could start the baseline. Both the baseline and post measurements were taken 
with outside air temperatures of 88 degrees. 
The boundary of the testing was the DX unit and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance 
calculations is very high.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the pilot DX unit to perform prior to and 
following the PermaFrost NMR® being installed. The report will also illustrate the amount of thermal 
degradation that has occurred due in large part to thermal degradation within the heat exchangers and how much of 
that has been restored.
 
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• Tons = (Airflow * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta) / 12,000 
 
• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
 
• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Air Temp – Saturated Suction Temp
Notes 
Following a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to determine the operational condition of the system was 
satisfactory, Baseline M&V data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. Four hundred runtime hours after 
installation of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, the M&V team returned on a very similar weather day to the Baseline to 
take Post M&V measurements in the identical fashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements and associated 
calculations show the amount of capacity restored.
The following IPMVP data points were recorded on 3 June 2014 using recently calibrated devices by NIST (National 
Institutes of Standards and Technology) to insure measurement accuracy. The DX unit was then treated with 
PermaFrost NMR® on the same day and allowed to run until 6 August 2014 to ensure the patented surface science 
nanotechnology had ample time to seat into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All measurements were taken at 
100% load and at similar return air and outdoor air temperatures. 
The collection of the data in both the baseline and post periods was collected by Powertron Global® under the watchful eye 
of Municipal School District ISD technicians and [Principal Engineer], of Energy Consulting Partner. The Municipal School District ISD technicians, maintain the unit 
and [Principal Engineer] oversaw the Project for Municipal School District ISD.

Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
DX Unit Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Municipal School District ISD has the problem of thermal degradation in its HVAC/R units. The lower operating tonnage and 
COP ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. 
The degraded equipment performance is costing Municipal School District ISD significant money and wasting energy. The 
equipment is using significantly more kWh to operate than it used when it was new. 
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the DX unit in the baseline and 
post testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. 
The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 3 operating tons and an average 
improvement of 59.3% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the DX 
unit throughout the year.

The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration PermaFrost NMR® created in the treated 
DX unit. The average cost to operate this unit before it 
was treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, was 1.81.
The specific cost to operate this unit after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, is currently 1.14.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ 
was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate 
for a 10 year old DX unit. The post results are also in 
line with the average improvement savings shown 
over more than 120,000 installations globally.

HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Calculated Eﬃciency of West Lake High School/Municipal School District ISD Unit Baseline and Post
The chart below illustrates just how far off design the Municipal School District ISD DX unit had degraded in terms of efficiency 
over 10 years of the coils being in use. The unit was performing at an average of 69.2% of the original design 
efficiency when first installed. The actual design rated tonnage of this DX unit is 7.7 tons. In actuality however, 
the unit was only producing 5.19 tons at the start of the pilot. The majority of this 30.7% efficiency loss was 
directly attributable to thermal degradation of the heat exchange surfaces that naturally occurs over time, creating a barrier to optimal heat transfer through the tube walls. 
After the ECM was installed, the average efficiency in the DX unit jumped up to 106% of design specifications 
or 8.15 tons. This represents a 57% improvement in efficiency over the baseline numbers.

HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Cost to West Lake High School/Municipal School District ISD to Operate the DX Unit Baseline vs Post
The next chart illustrates the just how much money the efficiency performance loss in the pilot DX unit was 
costing West Lake HS/Municipal School District ISD in the way of wasted energy each and every day they were operating prior to 
the ECM. The average cost to operate this unit as calculated in kW/ ton was 1.81 in the Baseline. When new, the 
kW/ton rating for units like these usually range from 1.0-1.2 kW/ton. This means West Lake HS/Municipal School District ISD 
was paying up to 37% more than design for energy to run the DX unit as a direct result of the baseline reduced 
level of performance. The kW/ton ratings measured on site in Austin, Texas were very much in line with the 
ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers.
  
The restored average kW/ton rating following the ECM is now 1.14. This represents a 37% reduction in energy 
costs from the baseline for every ton of cooling produced. It also brings down the West Lake HS/Municipal School District ISD 
costs to operate the unit to just above design. This will result in an initial payback period to West Lake 
HS/Municipal School District ISD of approximately 7.3 months. Over just a few years these accumulated savings will greatly 
reduce the eventual CapEx costs to replace the DX unit when it finally reaches the end of its useful life.

Return On Investment
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the West Lake HS/Municipal School District ISD DX Unit.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 5.19 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: 1.81 kW/ton * 8.15 tons = 14.75 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 14.75 kW * 3000 Annual Operating Hrs = 44,250 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 44,250 kWh * $.10 = $4,425
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: 1.14 kW/ton * 8.15 tons = 9.3 kW
Annual kWh Post: 9.3 kW * 3000 hours = 27,900 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 27,900 kWh * .10 cents = $2,790
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $4,425 - $ 2,790 = $1,630
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $1,635 / 12 = $136
Initial Payback Period
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot DX unit: $1,000
Estimated ROI Period for Pilot DX Unit: $1000/ $136 = 7.3 months
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period 
for West Lake High School and Municipal School District ISD for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression 
Analysis is used to calculate the true energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased 
capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to 
run the systems was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available 
tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the 
PermaFrostNMR® ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for 
the reduced number of hours the systems will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the 
systems to reach the internal building set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand 
loading.

West Lake High School and Municipal School District ISD are Saving More
than Just Energy
By treating just the pilot DX unit with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the current manner West Lake High 
School and Municipal School District ISD operates this unit, it will save approximately 16,350 kWh per year and all the costs 
associated with those savings. From an environmental impact standpoint, West Lake High School and Municipal School District 
ISD is also benefitting the surrounding community of Austin, Texas. Imagine how great the environmental 
impact will be when West Lake High School and Municipal School District ISD moves forward with treating all their climate 
control systems across their portfolio of buildings.
The 16,350 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 11.3 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from 
being released or any of the following:

Closing Observations
In addition to significantly reducing HVAC/R costs at Municipal School District ISD by implementing PermaFrost NMR®, Municipal School District 
ISD can also expect to benefit by increased service life and reduced maintenance costs. Not only will the 
system last longer because it runs less (by reaching set-point temperatures faster), but PermaFrost NMR® is 
also proven to increase lubricity above the OEM oil and it also includes preventative maintenance measures 
such as anti-humectants, acid scavengers, as well as seal/bearing conditioners - all of which contribute to the 
life extension of the equipment. Considering Municipal School District ISD's process of acquiring new HVAC assets (via bonds), 
Municipal School District ISD can now reconsider future bond amounts by delaying the replacement of some units, reducing the 
amount required to fund new capital equipment.
Municipal School District ISD can also expect an improvement in indoor air quality by reducing humidity levels due to the 
efficiency restoration. Lower humidity levels also help reduce the potential for mold, mildew, etc. The drop 
in humidity can allow Municipal School District ISD to operate at a higher thermostat setting by one to three degrees, while 
keeping comfort levels unchanged and drive the kWh savings even further. 
Not only will Municipal School District ISD will be making significant progress towards exceeding efficiency goals by 
implementing PermaFrost NMR®, it will also help solidify their role as a leader in sustainability and 
environmental stewardship by making a meaningful reduction to their carbon footprint. When calculated 
over several years a PermaFrost NMR® implementation can free up large amounts of capital for Municipal School District ISD - 
the total savings which include energy savings, maintenance savings, extended equipment life, reduced 
demand charges, etc. are significant.
