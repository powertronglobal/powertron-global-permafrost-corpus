Notes
The pilot DX unit provides cooling to the Gymnasium 
hallway at the West Lake High School Campus. The annual 
run-time on the pilot unit is approximately 3000 hours, (based 
upon 11.5 hours per day during 187 days of school and some 
additional school events during the summer), or more prior to 
PermaFrost NMR® being implemented.
