Recovered Wasted Energy with ECM -  DX Unit
The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration PermaFrost NMR® created in the treated 
DX unit. The average cost to operate this unit before it 
was treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, was 1.81.
The specific cost to operate this unit after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, is currently 1.14.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ 
was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate 
for a 10 year old DX unit. The post results are also in 
line with the average improvement savings shown 
over more than 120,000 installations globally.
