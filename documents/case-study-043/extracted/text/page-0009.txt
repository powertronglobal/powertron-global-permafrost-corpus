Return On Investment
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the West Lake HS/Municipal School District ISD DX Unit.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 5.19 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: 1.81 kW/ton * 8.15 tons = 14.75 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 14.75 kW * 3000 Annual Operating Hrs = 44,250 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 44,250 kWh * $.10 = $4,425
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: 1.14 kW/ton * 8.15 tons = 9.3 kW
Annual kWh Post: 9.3 kW * 3000 hours = 27,900 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 27,900 kWh * .10 cents = $2,790
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $4,425 - $ 2,790 = $1,630
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $1,635 / 12 = $136
Initial Payback Period
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot DX unit: $1,000
Estimated ROI Period for Pilot DX Unit: $1000/ $136 = 7.3 months
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period 
for West Lake High School and Municipal School District ISD for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression 
Analysis is used to calculate the true energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased 
capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to 
run the systems was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available 
tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the 
PermaFrostNMR® ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for 
the reduced number of hours the systems will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the 
systems to reach the internal building set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand 
loading.
