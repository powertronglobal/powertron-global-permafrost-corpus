HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report
Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study
The purpose of this study is to verify the industry wide problem of efficiency loss in HVAC/R as projected by 
ASHRAE research and to quantify the amount of money wasted due to this loss. Many industry leading 
organizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age. 
Thermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVACR equipment that operates as a 
vapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well 
documented by the HVACR industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal degradation 
prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times and additional 
kWh consumption.
The DX unit in this study is representative of 40% of the equipment operated by Municipal School District ISD. If thermal 
degradation is present in this DX unit, it is present in the entire inventory of the DX equipment. Energy waste 
can be calculated based on this unit (portfolio representation) and then accurately extrapolated across the
entire inventory of DX equipment if average age of equipment is known.
