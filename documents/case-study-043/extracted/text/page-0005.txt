Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
DX Unit Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Municipal School District ISD has the problem of thermal degradation in its HVAC/R units. The lower operating tonnage and 
COP ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. 
The degraded equipment performance is costing Municipal School District ISD significant money and wasting energy. The 
equipment is using significantly more kWh to operate than it used when it was new. 
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the DX unit in the baseline and 
post testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. 
The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 3 operating tons and an average 
improvement of 59.3% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the DX 
unit throughout the year.
