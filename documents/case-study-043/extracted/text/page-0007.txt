HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Calculated Eﬃciency of West Lake High School/Municipal School District ISD Unit Baseline and Post
The chart below illustrates just how far off design the Municipal School District ISD DX unit had degraded in terms of efficiency 
over 10 years of the coils being in use. The unit was performing at an average of 69.2% of the original design 
efficiency when first installed. The actual design rated tonnage of this DX unit is 7.7 tons. In actuality however, 
the unit was only producing 5.19 tons at the start of the pilot. The majority of this 30.7% efficiency loss was 
directly attributable to thermal degradation of the heat exchange surfaces that naturally occurs
over time, creating a barrier to optimal heat transfer through the tube walls. 
After the ECM was installed, the average efficiency in the DX unit jumped up to 106% of design specifications 
or 8.15 tons. This represents a 57% improvement in efficiency over the baseline numbers.
