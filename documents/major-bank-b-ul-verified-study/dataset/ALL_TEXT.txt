The in-situ testing of PermaFrost NMR in two unitary systems occurred at 
two locations in Brooklyn, NY. The addresses are 987 4th Avenue & 9904 
4th Avenue. The instrumentation utilized during the baseline and the post 
data gathering period were identical. The methods to employ these 
instruments were identical as well. Current instrument validation of 
calibration and accuracy were furnished to Underwriters Laboratories (UL) 
to assure compliance with accepted standards. 
 
On August 10, 2015 during the baseline measurements, UL’s Senior Field 
Engineer [UL Field Engineer] witnessed and verified all readings performed by 
Powertron Global’s Senior Engineer [Senior Energy Engineer]. On September 3, 
2015 the team returned to these same two locations and performed the 
post measurements with UL’s Engineering technician [UL Engineering Technician] 
verifying all data collection.  
 
After all data was received, field data sheets were completed by 
requesting the data that was sent to the mobile devices of the U.L. 
representatives to be read aloud to the field engineer performing the test 
and that the data read from their devices was transferred in writing to the 
field sheet. The U.L. representatives were asked to sign and date these 
sheets and photograph the results. 
 
The following categories were measured and witnessed by the UL 
representatives:  
 
- System air volume (CFM) 
- Return and supply air dry and wet bulb temperature (measured across

- Total equipment voltage and amperage (measured at the service 
disconnect switch) 
- Refrigerant suction, discharge pressures, superheat and sub-cooling 
- Dry bulb temperature of outdoor air entering the fin and tube condenser

Study Overview
This report details the results of the recently completed comprehensive energy performance study conducted at 
four New York City Major Bank B locations. They are as follows:
 
 
• 987 4th Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 
 
• 9904 4th Avenue, Brooklyn, NY
 
• 16406 Union Turnpike, Queens, NY 
         
• [Queens Laboratory Address], Queens, NY
Running from August 10 to September 4, 2015, the pilot was designed to illustrate the positive impact the 
PermaFrost NMR® energy control measure (ECM) would have on the overall cooling performance of common 
types of cooling systems supporting the Major Bank B portfolio of facilities. A variety of package rooftop units were 
tested at three of the locations, while a common split system was tested at the fourth location.
As demonstrated in this field trial, PermaFrost NMR® restores the capacity lost over time due to fouling of the 
heat exchange surfaces. This improvement in thermal performance will manifest itself in any or all of the 
following ways:
 
• Restored additional capacity to better satisfy fluctuating building loads 
 
• Additional critical HVAC redundancy at no extra cost or interruption to facility operations
 
• Improved system efficiency, lowering cost to produce each ton of cooling required (i.e., kW/ton)
 
• Restored thermal efficiency allowing systems to achieve thermostat set points faster, reducing 
 
   runtime (i.e., kWh) and extending useful equipment life an average of 15% 
The improvements demonstrated in this or any field test resulting from PermaFrost NMR® are dependent on 
factors such as age, condition, service history, runtime of one or both compressors and the design and application 
of each system. The results in this pilot were very consistent with 13 year historical performance averages as well 
as the recent laboratory study completed in May, 2015 by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) in their testing 
chambers in [Texas Location], TX.

NMR®  in the four HVAC systems included in this study:
1. Energy Savings (annual)   
 
 
 
 
 
$  4,236
2. Avoided cost of additional capacity replacement   
 
$  6,000  
3. Deferred capital costs

6. Annual Rate of Return 
 
 
 
 
 
109%
7. Return On Investment (5 years) 
 
 
 
 
547%
Highlights of the study:
• The four HVAC systems tested ranged in age from 7 to 12 years respectively with the average age 
    being 9 years in service. The pilot systems  produced a combined 30.02 ton of cooling. After the 
    installation of Permafrost NMR® 22%  of the cooling capacity was restored (36.63 tons post vs 30.02 
    ton baseline).
• The average cost to produce each ton of cooling on the pilot systems dropped 21% from 1.43 kW/ton 
    in the baseline to 1.13 kW/ton. 
• The average Coefficient of Performance (COP) of the pilot systems improved 23.7% from an average 
    of 2.91 in the baseline to 3.60. 
• The average cost to operate each system at an average of $.17 per kWh delivered fell 19.6% from 
    $5,403 in the baseline to $4,344.
• The cost to treat all four of the pilot systems of $3,875 divided by the annual savings achieved of 
    $4,236 results in an average payback period of 11 months.

Objectives
The PermaFrost NMR® study was jointly-conducted by Major Bank B, Property Management Firm B, Underwriters Laboratories (UL), 
HVAC Contractor A and Powertron Global and achieved four objectives: 
 
1. Determine that the “as-is” capacity and efficiency of the four pilot systems supporting the 
 
   aforementioned Major Bank B facilities had degraded by at least 10% after an average of 9 years in 
 
   operation.  
 
2. Verify that an average of 10% performance improvement in both tonnage and kW/ton occurred  
 
    across all four of pilot cooling systems due to the installation of PermaFrost NMR®. A lower kW/ton 
 
    efficiency ratio reduces the unit cost of running climate control systems.
 
3. Verify that every system is producing cooler, drier air as measured in both Dry Bulb and Wet Bulb 
 
    deltas due to the installation of  PermaFrost NMR®.
 
4. Report the financial benefits associated with efficiency improvements realized over the duration of 
 
    the study in terms of energy cost savings and capital improvements of restored capacity.. 
 
    The financial benefits support an effective business case for Major Bank B portfolio of properties to reduce 
 
    its unit cost for cooling providing a 24-month or less payback to Major Bank B.
The multiple cooling systems involved in the study are recorded as follows:
Carrier, Mfg date: 2006, R22, 208 volt-3 Phase, Model 48HJF009 (987 4th Ave, Brooklyn)
Carrier, Mfg date: 2008, R22, 208 volt-3 Phase, Model 48HJF012 (9904 4th Ave, Brooklyn)
Carrier, Mfg date: 2006, R22, 208 volt-3 Phase, Model 48HJF008 (16406 Union Tnpk, Queens)
Carrier, Mfg date: 2003, R22, 208 volt-3 Phase, Model 38TRA048 ([Queens Laboratory Address], Queens)

Methodology
After verifying the amount of air flowing across the evaporator coils before beginning each pilot, the 
subsequent measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected using AHRI Standards 210/240
& 340/360 and compiled in accordance with Option B of the IPMVP (International Measurement and 
Verification Protocol) framework.   
The results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic 
engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• kW/ton = Actual Measured Energy / Actual Measured Capacity 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = 12 / (kW/ton) /3.412
 
• Actual Cooling Capacity per Hour = (Measured CFM * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta T) / 12,000 BTU
Recovered Unit Cost with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
The kW/ton is the standard Unit Cost in the HVAC 
industry. It is the HVAC industry’s standard of 
determining how much energy is required to create 1 ton 
of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you reduce your 
unit cost of cooling you are saving regardless of how 
much cooling is required.
The chart to the right illustrates the amount of efficiency 
restoration the ECM created in the pilot systems after 
installation. This degradation in operational efficiency is 
costing Major Bank B a substantial amount of money in 
wasted energy.  As the last chart clearly illustrates, the 
pilot systems are currently performing 21% more 
efficiently than the control systems. This gap will only 
continue to widen until it levels off at 30-35% loss of 
efficiency.

Energy Consumption & Financial Detail
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the pilot systems compared to the control system.
Avg. Baseline Energy Consumption
Avg. Baseline Capacity:  7.51 tons
Avg. Adjusted kW Baseline:  1.16 kW/ton * 9.16 tons = 10.63 kW
Avg. Adjusted Baseline kWh:  10.63 kW * 2,990 Annual Operating Hrs = 31,784 kWh
Avg. Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 31,784 kWh * $.17 = $5,403
Avg. Post Energy Consumption
kW Post:  .933 kW/ton * 9.16 tons = 8.545 kW
Annual kWh Post:  8.545 kW * 2,990 hours = 25,550 kWh
Annual Cost Post:  25,550 kWh * $.17 cents = $4,344
Avg. Savings per Year Per System
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year:  $5,403 - $4,344 = $1,059
Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $1,059 / 12 = $88
Estimated Energy savings per year for all four pilot systems = $4,236
Payback Period
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in all four pilot cooling systems: $3,875
Estimated Payback Period for Major Bank B when treating all four pilot cooling systems: $3,875 / $352 = 11 Months
Return on Investment
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 109%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 547%
Explanation of Regression Analysis
Utilizing data collected during the pilot study, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for TD 
Bank for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in both capacity and efficiency. Working together, these improvements reduce the 
annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the cooling systems 
was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available capacity and then 
subtracting the revised cost to run the systems at the same restored capacity after the PermaFrostNMR® ECM was installed. 
This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or load % at 
which the systems will now operate due to the restored performance profile. This restored performance profile allows the 
cooling systems to satisfy the internal area set point with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.

Capital Improvements Detail
The capacity recovered after the PermaFrost NMR®  treatment has substantial capital benefits including cost 
avoidance, deferred capital expense, and capital improvement in addition to the reduced energy cost to run the 
systems.  These are instantaneous benefits realized at installation.
Treating the 4 HVAC systems with PermaFrost NMR® allows Major Bank B to realize the following 
ﬁnancial beneﬁts: 
 
1. Restoration of 6 tons of HVAC Capacity. (Current rate to purchase commercial rooftop HVAC 
 
    capacity is ~ $1000 per ton installed). 
 
2. Deferred Capital Cost. (Extending the remaining useful life of HVAC equipment will defer capital 
 
    cost of replacement. Using five years (30%) service life remaining, the systems will experience an 
 
    estimated 1-1.5 years of additional service life, deferring replacement costs by 20%). 
 
3. Capital Improvement Deduction. (Improving performance and extending the useful life of existing 
 
    equipment allows for a capital expense classification. This classification enhances EBITDA, reduces 
 
    exposure, and preserves asset value while deducting the expense over the remaining life of the system 
 
    ~ 5 years).

Major Bank B is Saving More than Just Energy and
Preserving Capital
By treating the pilot cooling systems plus all the other equipment at the four locations with PermaFrost 
NMR®, based on the manner in which the systems are currently being operated, Major Bank B will save 
approximately 87,276 kWh per year and all the costs associated with those savings. From an environmental 
impact standpoint, Major Bank B will also benefit all the surrounding communities in which they operate.  
Imagine the positive environmental impacts of treating the rest of Major Bank B portfolio of offices and retail 
locations spread across the eastern seaboard.  
The 87,276 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 60.2 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from 
being released or any of the following:
