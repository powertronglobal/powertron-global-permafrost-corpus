NMR®  in the four HVAC systems included in this study:
1. Energy Savings (annual)   
 
 
 
 
 
$  4,236
2. Avoided cost of additional capacity replacement   
 
$  6,000  
3. Deferred capital costs 
 
 
 
  
 
$  1,200 
4. Capital improvement deduction 
 
 
 
 
$  3,875 
5. Payback Period 
 
 
 
 
 
 
11 Months
6. Annual Rate of Return 
 
 
 
 
 
109%
7. Return On Investment (5 years) 
 
 
 
 
547%
Highlights of the study:
• The four HVAC systems tested ranged in age from 7 to 12 years respectively with the average age 
    being 9 years in service. The pilot systems  produced a combined 30.02 ton of cooling. After the 
    installation of Permafrost NMR® 22%  of the cooling capacity was restored (36.63 tons post vs 30.02 
    ton baseline).
• The average cost to produce each ton of cooling on the pilot systems dropped 21% from 1.43 kW/ton 
    in the baseline to 1.13 kW/ton. 
• The average Coefficient of Performance (COP) of the pilot systems improved 23.7% from an average 
    of 2.91 in the baseline to 3.60. 
• The average cost to operate each system at an average of $.17 per kWh delivered fell 19.6% from 
    $5,403 in the baseline to $4,344.
• The cost to treat all four of the pilot systems of $3,875 divided by the annual savings achieved of 
    $4,236 results in an average payback period of 11 months.
