Study Overview
This report details the results of the recently completed comprehensive energy performance study conducted at 
four New York City Major Bank B locations. They are as follows:
 
 
• 987 4th Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 
 
• 9904 4th Avenue, Brooklyn, NY
 
• 16406 Union Turnpike, Queens, NY 
         
• [Queens Laboratory Address], Queens, NY
Running from August 10 to September 4, 2015, the pilot was designed to illustrate the positive impact the 
PermaFrost NMR® energy control measure (ECM) would have on the overall cooling performance of common 
types of cooling systems supporting the Major Bank B portfolio of facilities. A variety of package rooftop units were 
tested at three of the locations, while a common split system was tested at the fourth location.
As demonstrated in this field trial, PermaFrost NMR® restores the capacity lost over time due to fouling of the 
heat exchange surfaces. This improvement in thermal performance will manifest itself in any or all of the 
following ways:
 
• Restored additional capacity to better satisfy fluctuating building loads 
 
• Additional critical HVAC redundancy at no extra cost or interruption to facility operations
 
• Improved system efficiency, lowering cost to produce each ton of cooling required (i.e., kW/ton)
 
• Restored thermal efficiency allowing systems to achieve thermostat set points faster, reducing 
 
   runtime (i.e., kWh) and extending useful equipment life an average of 15% 
The improvements demonstrated in this or any field test resulting from PermaFrost NMR® are dependent on 
factors such as age, condition, service history, runtime of one or both compressors and the design and application 
of each system. The results in this pilot were very consistent with 13 year historical performance averages as well 
as the recent laboratory study completed in May, 2015 by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) in their testing 
chambers in [Texas Location], TX.
