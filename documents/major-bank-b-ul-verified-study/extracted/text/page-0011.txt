Capital Improvements Detail
The capacity recovered after the PermaFrost NMR®  treatment has substantial capital benefits including cost 
avoidance, deferred capital expense, and capital improvement in addition to the reduced energy cost to run the 
systems.  These are instantaneous benefits realized at installation.
Treating the 4 HVAC systems with PermaFrost NMR® allows Major Bank B to realize the following 
ﬁnancial beneﬁts: 
 
1. Restoration of 6 tons of HVAC Capacity. (Current rate to purchase commercial rooftop HVAC 
 
    capacity is ~ $1000 per ton installed). 
 
2. Deferred Capital Cost. (Extending the remaining useful life of HVAC equipment will defer capital 
 
    cost of replacement. Using five years (30%) service life remaining, the systems will experience an 
 
    estimated 1-1.5 years of additional service life, deferring replacement costs by 20%). 
 
3. Capital Improvement Deduction. (Improving performance and extending the useful life of existing 
 
    equipment allows for a capital expense classification. This classification enhances EBITDA, reduces 
 
    exposure, and preserves asset value while deducting the expense over the remaining life of the system 
 
    ~ 5 years).
