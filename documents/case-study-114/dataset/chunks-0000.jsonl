These units \nrepresent a microcosm of the overall Retail Chain C portfolio of equipment. \nUnderstanding the Opportunity for Efficiency Restoration\nAll Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (HVACR) systems experience thermal\ndegradation over time. Internal surfaces of heat exchangers lose their optimal thermal transfer\ncharacteristics, resulting in reduced capacity, lower efficiency, and higher operating costs. This\ndegradation affects superheat levels and overall system performance, impacting the useful\nequipment life of the HVACR system.\nRestoring System Efficiency with PermaFrost NMR\nPermaFrost NMR® technology addresses this thermal degradation by creating a permanent thermal\nmetal coating on the tube walls, whether on the inside or outside surfaces depending on the HVACR\nequipment. This coating conditions the metal surfaces, reducing friction and restoring the system's\noriginal thermal transfer efficiency. In every application this results in a lower per unit cost of cooling\nwhich ultimately translates into lower overall energy costs. \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 605, "chars": 2843, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_110_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:5c28ff156895022296299e552c49bcb53db5d8798b4c2846e60b323611622498"}

Units \n51 and 52 were initially tested and treated on 16 July 2014 and had 400+ runtime hours after installation of the ECM \nbefore the post readings were taken on 25 Sept 2014. Due to some maintenance and scheduling issues, units 50 and 57 \nwere not initially tested and treated until 14 Aug 2014 and had just over 300 runtime hours while the chiller, which was \nalso tested and treated on 14 Aug, had just under 250 runtime hours on it when post readings were taken on 25 Sept \n2014. Since the combined results were well within expected savings parameters, no further readings are necessary.  \nBoth the baseline dates were nearly identical weather and building load perspective. The scheduled post reading date was \nsomewhat cooler but the internal building load was the same in three of the spaces served by the units. To replicate \nsimilar weather conditions on the RTUs, doors were opened to the compressors to get the head pressures to close to what \nthey were in the baseline readings. Any shortfalls in pressures were adjusted for by raising the post amps accordingly. \nDue to differences in operational load, the area served by unit 50 was above the 1 degree entering air WB temperature \ndifference testing parameters we normally accept to assure high confidence in the data but the team decided to leave it a \npart of the study for transparency. The load on circuit B of the chiller was much higher in the post (86.5%) than in the \nbaseline (50%) and since circuit A was still down for maintenance the M&V team could not load limit the chiller to take \nmeasurements without negatively affecting laundry operations. For this portion of the test the key element to look at is the \nreduction of kW/ton. \nAs expected in any in-situ testing, all the RTUs had varying airflows, refrigerant temps and enthalpy deltas which show \nup in the varying levels of performance. This is the reason to focus on the delta improvements both at each unit and as an \naggregate. \nThe collection of the data in both the baseline and post periods was collected by Powertron Global® while witnessed \nthroughout by HVAC Services Provider technicians. Pictures were also taken of all the key readings used in the formulas and are \navailable upon request.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 663, "chars": 3132, "pages": {"start": 5, "end": 6}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_110_chunk_0003", "next_id": "pdf_110_chunk_0005", "content_hash": "sha256:5fd0d312dc4e1b904da4f98710184cb36ed9ea82b52159afd045ec65de703337"}

This represents 80.2% of nominal design capacity. The \nmajority of this capacity loss is directly attributable to the thermal degradation of the heat exchange surfaces \nover time. This is due in large part to thermal degradation which creates an insulating barrier to heat transfer on the \ntube walls. \nAfter the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed and allowed to work inside the units for an average of 300+ \nruntime hours, the average total capacity of the five pilot units rose 32.19 tons to 140.5 tons or 104% of the \noverall nominal design capacity of all five units.
