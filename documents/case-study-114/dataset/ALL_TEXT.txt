Retail Chain C Energy Eﬃciency Study
Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study
This efficiency study was conducted in an effort to verify the effectiveness of the PermaFrost NMR®  Energy 
Conservation Measure (ECM) in four large roof top units (RTUs) and a chiller at Retail Chain C (Retail Chain C) 
distribution facility and to document the future avoided energy costs associated with the same. These units 
represent a microcosm of the overall Retail Chain C portfolio of equipment. 
Understanding the Opportunity for Efficiency Restoration
All Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (HVACR) systems experience thermal
degradation over time. Internal surfaces of heat exchangers lose their optimal thermal transfer
characteristics, resulting in reduced capacity, lower efficiency, and higher operating costs. This
degradation affects superheat levels and overall system performance, impacting the useful
equipment life of the HVACR system.
Restoring System Efficiency with PermaFrost NMR
PermaFrost NMR® technology addresses this thermal degradation by creating a permanent thermal
metal coating on the tube walls, whether on the inside or outside surfaces depending on the HVACR
equipment. This coating conditions the metal surfaces, reducing friction and restoring the system's
original thermal transfer efficiency. In every application this results in a lower per unit cost of cooling
which ultimately translates into lower overall energy costs.

Summary Results of Retail Chain C Study
This comprehensive report contains specific information regarding the performance profiles of four 25-ton 
Roof Top Units (RTUs) and one 140-ton air cooled chiller at Retail Chain C facility in [Texas City]. 
At the conclusion of the pilot, the five units showed the following substantial changes: 
 
• Overall capacity rose by 32.19 tons from 108.31 tons to 140.5 tons or 29.7%
 
• Average cost per unit of cooling (i.e., kW/ton) fell by .46 from 1.52 to 1.06 or 30.3%
 
• Aggregate kWh consumed based on avg kW/ton fell by 223,749 from 739,345 to 515,596 or 30.3% 
 
• Energy costs to operate the five units fell by $22,375 from $73,935 to $51,560 or 30.3%  
These efficiency improvements demonstrated equate to an Initial Payback Period (IPP) of the Retail Chain C project 
(including all testing fees) of 11.7 months and a corresponding Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 103%. This is 
exactly what was estimated in the proposal given the age and average runtime of the equipment.
Further details of the measurements are described in the various sections later in this report. All testing was 
conducted by Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer] while being assisted and 
witnessed throughout by [Facility Manager] of Retail Chain C and his HVAC contractor, HVAC Services Provider.

Process
This comprehensive report contains specific information regarding the performance profiles of four of the 116 
packaged RTUs and one air-cooled chiller that support Retail Chain C facility in [Texas City]. 
Detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the units before (baseline) and 
after (post) the installation of the ECM. This testing determined the impact on three key elements relating to 
the original design specifications that greatly affect the HVAC portion of Retail Chain C power bill.  They include:
 
1. The cooling capacity the units are capable of producing after 11+ years in service. 
 
2. The actual cost of per unit of cooling the units are delivering as reflected in the kW/ton 
 
    measurement. 
 
3. The thermal dynamic ability of the equipment to still perform at or close to operational design.  
Methodology
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the 
IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework and the standards set forth by the 
National Environmental Balancing Bureau (NEBB).
 
Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer] took and recorded all of the readings while 
being assisted and witnessed by HVAC Services Provider technicians during every phase of the testing.  
The collection periods for each of the units were similar in both the baseline and post periods to best replicate 
internal building loads.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the pilot chiller to perform prior to 
PermaFrost NMR® (ECM) being installed, as well as illustrate the amount of thermal degradation due in large 
part to thermal degradation within the heat exchangers (evaporator and condenser barrels).
 
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following applicable thermodynamic 
engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• Ton = (Airflow * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta) / 12,000 
 
• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
 
• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU 
 
• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Water Temp – Saturated Evaporator Temp (CH)

Engineering Notes
Following a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to determine the operational condition of the units were 
satisfactory, Baseline M&V data was collected and recorded by the M&V team with assistance from HVAC Services Provider. Units 
51 and 52 were initially tested and treated on 16 July 2014 and had 400+ runtime hours after installation of the ECM 
before the post readings were taken on 25 Sept 2014. Due to some maintenance and scheduling issues, units 50 and 57 
were not initially tested and treated until 14 Aug 2014 and had just over 300 runtime hours while the chiller, which was 
also tested and treated on 14 Aug, had just under 250 runtime hours on it when post readings were taken on 25 Sept 
2014. Since the combined results were well within expected savings parameters, no further readings are necessary.  
Both the baseline dates were nearly identical weather and building load perspective. The scheduled post reading date was 
somewhat cooler but the internal building load was the same in three of the spaces served by the units. To replicate 
similar weather conditions on the RTUs, doors were opened to the compressors to get the head pressures to close to what 
they were in the baseline readings. Any shortfalls in pressures were adjusted for by raising the post amps accordingly. 
Due to differences in operational load, the area served by unit 50 was above the 1 degree entering air WB temperature 
difference testing parameters we normally accept to assure high confidence in the data but the team decided to leave it a 
part of the study for transparency. The load on circuit B of the chiller was much higher in the post (86.5%) than in the 
baseline (50%) and since circuit A was still down for maintenance the M&V team could not load limit the chiller to take 
measurements without negatively affecting laundry operations. For this portion of the test the key element to look at is the 
reduction of kW/ton. 
As expected in any in-situ testing, all the RTUs had varying airflows, refrigerant temps and enthalpy deltas which show 
up in the varying levels of performance. This is the reason to focus on the delta improvements both at each unit and as an 
aggregate. 
The collection of the data in both the baseline and post periods was collected by Powertron Global® while witnessed 
throughout by HVAC Services Provider technicians. Pictures were also taken of all the key readings used in the formulas and are 
available upon request.

Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Calculated Capacity of Retail Chain C Units Baseline and Post
The charts below illustrate just how far off Retail Chain C units had degraded in terms of capacity over 11+ years of use. 
With the RTUs operating at 100% load and the chiller at 50% load (adjusted down from 87% in post), these  
same five pilot units were determined in the baseline measurement periods to be producing a total of 108.31 
tons of cooling out of a possible 135 nominal design tons. This represents 80.2% of nominal design capacity. The 
majority of this capacity loss is directly attributable to the thermal degradation of the heat exchange surfaces 
over time. This is due in large part to thermal degradation which creates an insulating barrier to heat transfer on the 
tube walls. 
After the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed and allowed to work inside the units for an average of 300+ 
runtime hours, the average total capacity of the five pilot units rose 32.19 tons to 140.5 tons or 104% of the 
overall nominal design capacity of all five units. This represents a 29.7% increase in nominal capacity over the 
baseline numbers.

Calculated Cost Per Cooling Unit to Operate
The chart to the right illustrates the performance
efficiency the PermaFrost NMR® ECM created in the 
five treated pilot units. The average cost to operate 
these units before they were treated, as calculated in 
kW/ton, was 1.52.
The specific cost to operate these same units after 
they were treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as 
calculated in kW/ton, is currently 1.06.
The baseline kW/ton ratings measured in-situ were 
expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimations 
for 11+ year old equipment. The post results are also 
in line with the average improvement savings shown 
over more than 125,000 installations globally.

Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the five Retail Chain C pilot units.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Adjusted Baseline Tonnage: 140.5 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: 1.52 kW/ton * 140.5 tons = 213.56 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 213.56 kW * 3,462 Annual Operating Hrs = 739,345 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 739,345 kWh * $.10 = $73,935
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: 1.06 kW/ton * 140.5 tons = 148.93 kW
Annual kWh Post: 148.93 kW * 3,462 hours = 515,596 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 515,596 kWh * .10 cents = $51,560
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $73,935 - $51,560 = $22,375
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $22,375 / 12 = $1,865
Initial Payback Period (IPP)
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in five pilot units (including M&V): $21,750
Estimated IPP for Retail Chain C on the five pilot units: $21,750 / $1,865 = 11.7 months
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 103%
Return on Investment Over 10 Years = 1,029%
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for 
Retail Chain C for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in the 
Avoided Energy Reporting (Post) Analysis Period. IPP comes from determining what the cost to run the systems was 
when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then 
subtracting the revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was 
installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the 
systems will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the internal 
building set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.

Retail Chain C is Saving More than just Energy
By treating all five Retail Chain C units with PermaFrost NMR® and based on the current manner in which Retail Chain C 
operates these units, the company will save approximately 223,749 kWh per year and all the costs associated 
with those savings. From an environmental impact standpoint, Retail Chain C is also benefitting the surrounding 
communities in Houston. Imagine how great the environmental impact will be when Retail Chain C moves forward 
with treating all their HVAC equipment across the USA.
The 223,749 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 154 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from 
being released or any of the following:
Annual greenhouse emissions from:
