Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the five Retail Chain C pilot units.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Adjusted Baseline Tonnage: 140.5 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: 1.52 kW/ton * 140.5 tons = 213.56 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 213.56 kW * 3,462 Annual Operating Hrs = 739,345 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 739,345 kWh * $.10 = $73,935
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: 1.06 kW/ton * 140.5 tons = 148.93 kW
Annual kWh Post: 148.93 kW * 3,462 hours = 515,596 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 515,596 kWh * .10 cents = $51,560
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $73,935 - $51,560 = $22,375
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $22,375 / 12 = $1,865
Initial Payback Period (IPP)
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in five pilot units (including M&V): $21,750
Estimated IPP for Retail Chain C on the five pilot units: $21,750 / $1,865 = 11.7 months
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 103%
Return on Investment Over 10 Years = 1,029%
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for 
Retail Chain C for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in the 
Avoided Energy Reporting (Post) Analysis Period. IPP comes from determining what the cost to run the systems was 
when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then 
subtracting the revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was 
installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the 
systems will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the internal 
building set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
