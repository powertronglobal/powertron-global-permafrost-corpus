Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Calculated Capacity of Retail Chain C Units Baseline and Post
The charts below illustrate just how far off Retail Chain C units had degraded in terms of capacity over 11+ years of use. 
With the RTUs operating at 100% load and the chiller at 50% load (adjusted down from 87% in post), these  
same five pilot units were determined in the baseline measurement periods to be producing a total of 108.31 
tons of cooling out of a possible 135 nominal design tons. This represents 80.2% of nominal design capacity. The 
majority of this capacity loss is directly attributable to the thermal degradation of the heat exchange surfaces 
over time. This is due in large part to thermal degradation which creates an insulating barrier to heat transfer on the 
tube walls. 
After the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed and allowed to work inside the units for an average of 300+ 
runtime hours, the average total capacity of the five pilot units rose 32.19 tons to 140.5 tons or 104% of the 
overall nominal design capacity of all five units. This represents a 29.7% increase in nominal capacity over the 
baseline numbers.
