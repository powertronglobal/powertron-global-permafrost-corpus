Summary Results of Retail Chain C Study
This comprehensive report contains specific information regarding the performance profiles of four 25-ton 
Roof Top Units (RTUs) and one 140-ton air cooled chiller at Retail Chain C facility in [Texas City]. 
At the conclusion of the pilot, the five units showed the following substantial changes: 
 
• Overall capacity rose by 32.19 tons from 108.31 tons to 140.5 tons or 29.7%
 
• Average cost per unit of cooling (i.e., kW/ton) fell by .46 from 1.52 to 1.06 or 30.3%
 
• Aggregate kWh consumed based on avg kW/ton fell by 223,749 from 739,345 to 515,596 or 30.3% 
 
• Energy costs to operate the five units fell by $22,375 from $73,935 to $51,560 or 30.3%  
These efficiency improvements demonstrated equate to an Initial Payback Period (IPP) of the Retail Chain C project 
(including all testing fees) of 11.7 months and a corresponding Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 103%. This is 
exactly what was estimated in the proposal given the age and average runtime of the equipment.
Further details of the measurements are described in the various sections later in this report. All testing was 
conducted by Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer] while being assisted and 
witnessed throughout by [Facility Manager] of Retail Chain C and his HVAC contractor, HVAC Services Provider.
