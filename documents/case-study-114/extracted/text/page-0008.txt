Calculated Cost Per Cooling Unit to Operate
The chart to the right illustrates the performance
efficiency the PermaFrost NMR® ECM created in the 
five treated pilot units. The average cost to operate 
these units before they were treated, as calculated in 
kW/ton, was 1.52.
The specific cost to operate these same units after 
they were treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as 
calculated in kW/ton, is currently 1.06.
The baseline kW/ton ratings measured in-situ were 
expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimations 
for 11+ year old equipment. The post results are also 
in line with the average improvement savings shown 
over more than 125,000 installations globally.
