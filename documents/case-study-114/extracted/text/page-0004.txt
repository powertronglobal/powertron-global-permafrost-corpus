Process
This comprehensive report contains specific information regarding the performance profiles of four of the 116 
packaged RTUs and one air-cooled chiller that support Retail Chain C facility in [Texas City]. 
Detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the units before (baseline) and 
after (post) the installation of the ECM. This testing determined the impact on three key elements relating to 
the original design specifications that greatly affect the HVAC portion of Retail Chain C power bill.  They include:
 
1. The cooling capacity the units are capable of producing after 11+ years in service. 
 
2. The actual cost of per unit of cooling the units are delivering as reflected in the kW/ton 
 
    measurement. 
 
3. The thermal dynamic ability of the equipment to still perform at or close to operational design.  
Methodology
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the 
IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework and the standards set forth by the 
National Environmental Balancing Bureau (NEBB).
 
Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer] took and recorded all of the readings while 
being assisted and witnessed by HVAC Services Provider technicians during every phase of the testing.  
The collection periods for each of the units were similar in both the baseline and post periods to best replicate 
internal building loads.
