Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the pilot chiller to perform prior to 
PermaFrost NMR® (ECM) being installed, as well as illustrate the amount of thermal degradation due in large 
part to thermal degradation within the heat exchangers (evaporator and condenser barrels).
 
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following applicable thermodynamic 
engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• Ton = (Airflow * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta) / 12,000 
 
• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
 
• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU 
 
• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Water Temp – Saturated Evaporator Temp (CH)
