Detailed forensic performance testing (outlined later in this report) was \nperformed on several of the operating units at each location (Store #75 & Store #112). The 5 units tested \nwere all York packaged rooftop units some using R-22 and some with R-410 refrigerant and totaling 32 tons \n(three 5-ton units and two 8.5-ton units). These two particular franchise locations are part of a series of \nstores owned by Regional Convenience Store Chain in the Baltimore metropolitan area. Infrastructure Contractor, represented by \n[Infrastructure Consultant] and [Client Representative], arranged with James Kitchens of Regional Convenience Store Chain, to perform this pilot.\n \nThe substantial improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at the units was solely \nattributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. The units now provide cooler supply air with greater efficiency \ndue to the restoration of the heat transfer ability of the evaporator and condenser coils, both of which have a \ndirect correlation to an increase in the number of Btuh the machines are now capable of producing. \n \nTotal system efficiency across all five units improved by an average of 29%, while the EER across the units \nrose by an average of 28.6%. There was an overall average increase in coil capacity of 29.1% Btuh, equating \nto the restoration of 7.2-tons of capacity or 29%. There is also a reduction of 22.3% in both total power and \nwatts per ton, which is another measurable way to view the thermodynamic enhancement of the \nPermaFrost NMR® ECM. Without any power company rebates factored in, the result of the average ECM \nimprovements is an ROI to Regional Convenience Store Chain of just 12.6 months (without rebates) based on the runtime \ninformation provided to the team by the store owners. Regional Convenience Store Chain is eligible for 65% rebate from BGE/ICF \nfor installed cost of PermaFrost NMR® which will significantly reduce the ROI. The tables of data and \nfinancial calculations are available for review at the end of this report.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 687, "chars": 3142, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_094_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:64a907e6591d748d3a555a8926d2d50f648e75a65bf70154e766098997e05c14"}

When installed into the low side port, the product immediately goes \nto work restoring optimal heat transfer characteristics to the coils by embedding into the microscopic\nlattice structure of the metal as a thermal transfer agent, forming a passive nano-magnetic film on\nthe surface. This process enhances the conductivity of the metal and creates a permanent thermal\ncoating that maintains optimal heat transfer efficiency for the life of the equipment. \nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity, and \nbetter refrigerant flow – all of which allows a system to achieve set temperatures quicker and then shut \noff, unload or throttle back. \nThe indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment \ninclude reduced run time, less kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, superior lubrication, \nless metallic wear and longer overall equipment life.\nBOUNDARY LAYER\nOIL REMOVED\nBEFORE TREATMENT\nAFTER TREATMENT\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 440, "chars": 2131, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_094_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_094_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:117ce31eeaad522a6e366744dbbcc24ac0000ce88bb8112ac1e4391c05103611"}

The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and \nAir-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the IPMVP \nas a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and products.\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.\nRetrofit Isolation (Option B) is defined as: All parameter measurement with the boundary of the ECM \n(Permafrost NMR®) as the single source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of \nthe energy use of the energy conservation method affected equipment or system and any performance \nenhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using \nmeasurements of proxies of energy use. \nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+/ - Routine adjustments +/ - Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 437, "chars": 2170, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_094_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_094_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:09e3929d5ec02a4de5796fccf3b2be2fe7dd97d28ffa70f0f764134fa41713df"}
