Performance Report on PermaFrost NMR® ECM

Regional Convenience Store Chain - 2 locations

October 2, 2012

Executive Summary

This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure

(ECM) PermaFrost NMR®. Detailed forensic performance testing (outlined later in this report) was

performed on several of the operating units at each location (Store #75 & Store #112). The 5 units tested

were all York packaged rooftop units some using R-22 and some with R-410 refrigerant and totaling 32 tons

(three 5-ton units and two 8.5-ton units). These two particular franchise locations are part of a series of

stores owned by Regional Convenience Store Chain in the Baltimore metropolitan area. Infrastructure Contractor, represented by

[Infrastructure Consultant] and [Client Representative], arranged with James Kitchens of Regional Convenience Store Chain, to perform this pilot.

The substantial improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at the units was solely

attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. The units now provide cooler supply air with greater efficiency

due to the restoration of the heat transfer ability of the evaporator and condenser coils, both of which have a

direct correlation to an increase in the number of Btuh the machines are now capable of producing.

Total system efficiency across all five units improved by an average of 29%, while the EER across the units

rose by an average of 28.6%. There was an overall average increase in coil capacity of 29.1% Btuh, equating

to the restoration of 7.2-tons of capacity or 29%. There is also a reduction of 22.3% in both total power and

watts per ton, which is another measurable way to view the thermodynamic enhancement of the

PermaFrost NMR® ECM. Without any power company rebates factored in, the result of the average ECM

improvements is an ROI to Regional Convenience Store Chain of just 12.6 months (without rebates) based on the runtime

information provided to the team by the store owners. Regional Convenience Store Chain is eligible for 65% rebate from BGE/ICF

for installed cost of PermaFrost NMR® which will significantly reduce the ROI. The tables of data and

financial calculations are available for review at the end of this report.

Product Brief

Our patented surface chemical nanotechnology is a sustainable one-time treatment that lasts for

the remaining useful life of any type of system in which it’s installed – DX (RTUs, Split Systems,

CRAC’s), Chillers (including Ammonia Chillers), Heat Pumps, Ice Machines, or Refrigerated Transport.

PermaFrost NMR® is a Nanotechnology that uses the patented Nucleo Molecular Regenerative®

(NMR) technology as its core agent. When installed into the low side port, the product immediately goes

to work restoring optimal heat transfer characteristics to the coils by embedding into the microscopic

lattice structure of the metal as a thermal transfer agent, forming a passive nano-magnetic film on

the surface. This process enhances the conductivity of the metal and creates a permanent thermal

coating that maintains optimal heat transfer efficiency for the life of the equipment.

The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity, and

better refrigerant flow – all of which allows a system to achieve set temperatures quicker and then shut

off, unload or throttle back.

The indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment

include reduced run time, less kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, superior lubrication,

less metallic wear and longer overall equipment life.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol

The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) is used to develop this

report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and

Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the IPMVP

as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and products.

There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They

are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.

Retrofit Isolation (Option B) is defined as: All parameter measurement with the boundary of the ECM

(Permafrost NMR®) as the single source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of

the energy use of the energy conservation method affected equipment or system and any performance

enhancements versus the baseline data.

Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the

savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term

measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by

short-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using

measurements of proxies of energy use.

The final computation follows the formula:

Energy Science Division

Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy

+/ - Routine adjustments +/ - Non-Routine Adjustments

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content

The content of the following report will demonstrate the effects of PermaFrost NMR®’s ability to correct the

effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces.

A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment is implemented to determine if the unit’s operational

conditions are satisfactory. Baseline measurements will be recorded and then the proper amount and type of

PermaFrost NMR® will be injected. The product will be allowed up to 4 weeks to seat itself into the metal

surfaces before post (E.R.P.) measurements were taken to establish the efficiency gains.

The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP International Performance Measurement and

Verification Protocol as the M&V plan. The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global’s Senior

Energy Engineer [Senior Energy Engineer] ME/CEM/CMC/CMVP.

The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:

kW = Volts * Amps * 1.47 (Three Phase) / 1000

Delta T = Return Air DB – Supply Air DB

Enthalpy = Return Air WB Deg. F and Supply Air WB Deg. F Converted to Enthalpy

Actual Btuh Capacity = Measured CFM X 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta (Baseline – Post)

System Eﬃciency % = Actual Coil Capacity Btuh / Nominal Coil Capacity Btuh

EER = Btuh / Adjusted Watts

Adjusted Total Watts = 1,367 WPT * 7.84 tons = 10,717

Adjusted Baseline kWh = (10,717 TW/1,000) * 8760 Annual Operating hrs = 93,881 kWh

Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM = 93,881 kWh * $.088 = $8,268

Post ECM kWh = (8,252 NTW / 1,000) * 8760 Annual Operating hrs = 72,288 kWh

Cost to Run After ECM = 72,288 kWh * $.088 = $6,362

Cost Savings per Month = ($8,268 - $6,362) / 12 = $159

Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed @ $855/ $159 = 5.4

ROI = 5.4 months

ROI with BGE/ICF rebates = 1.9 months

Energy Reporting Period

The identical IPMVP data recordings from the baseline (including insertion depths with probes) were

recorded on 9/19/2012 using the same recently NIST calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy.

Given the 18.5% cooler outdoor temperature in the Post, the compressor Amps (70% of the total Amps) were

adjusted upward by 18.5%. This adjustment then permeates through to the Post Watts as well as the Watts

per Ton. The measurements are as follows:

Baseline

The following results are based off of the Baseline Measurement of data and the Energy Reporting Period.

Baseline kWh = (7,788 CTW / 1,000) *8760 Annual Operating Hours = 68,223 kWh

Baseline Cost To Run = 68,223 kWh * $.088 = $5,997

Regression Analysis is then used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Unit.

Adjusted Baseline Tonnage = 8.49 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)

Adjusted Total Watts = 1,217 WPT * 8.49 tons = 10,332

Adjusted Baseline kWh = (10,332 TW/1,000) * 8760 Annual Operating hrs = 90,508 kWh

Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM = 90,508 kWh * $.088 = $7,991

Post ECM kWh = (8,151 NTW / 1,000) * 8760 Annual Operating hrs = 71,403 kWh

Cost to Run After ECM = 71,403 kWh * $.088 = $6,284

Cost Savings per Month = ($7,991 - $6,284) / 12 = $142

Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed @ $855/ $142 = 6

ROI = 6 months

ROI with BGE/ICF rebates = 2.1 months
