Lauderdale, FL \nComprehensive HVAC/R Capacity Study\nFeaturing the PermaFrost NMR® Energy Conservation Measure (ECM) \nProperty of Powertron Global®\n\n\n\n1\nHVAC/R Eﬃciency Report\nPurpose of the Study\nThe purpose of this study is to verify that the restored capacity produced six years+ ago when all four plit \nsystem DX units were first treated with the PermaFrost NMR® is being sustained. This same efficiency \nimprovement is then quantified into dollars saved by Major Global Bank A in the treated units. \nThe split system units involved in this study are representative of a great majority of the portfolio of equipment \noperated by Major Global Bank A. The same information gathered in the study is then extrapolated out across the entire Major Global Bank A \nportfolio to closely estimate what capacity has already been lost in term of increased energy costs. This same \nextrapolation methodology is also used to estimate what the potential future avoided wasted energy costs are \nexpected to be when treating all DX units types.  \nMany industry leading organizations, including the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air \nConditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), project that all heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration \n(HVACR) units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they operate and age. Thermal degradation is caused by a \nphenomenon that is present in all HVACR equipment that operates as a vapor compression cycle associated \nwith refrigerant and oil for lubrication. This thermal degradation is well documented by the HVACR industry \nand the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal degradation prevents units from operating at the \noriginal design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times and additional kWh consumption.\nProperty of Powertron Global®\n\n\n\n2\nProcess\nThis report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of four similar DX units \ntreated over six years ago with PermaFrost NMR® compared to where ASHRAE degradation averages had \nthem performing prior to treatment. \nDetailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the DX units after the \ninstallation of PermaFrost NMR® to determine the impact on the three key elements that greatly affect Major Global Bank A’s \npower bill as they relate to the original design specifications: \n \n1. The cooling capacity the units are capable of producing after an average of 10.5 years in service.\n \n2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the units are delivering as  \n \n    reflected in the kW/ton measurement. \n \n3. The thermal dynamic ability of the units to continue to perform at or close to operational design.\nMethodology\nThe measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the \nIPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted of Powertron \nGlobal’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer].  \nNotes\nThe readings were taken in the same conditions used by Air-Conditioning, Heating, & Refrigeration Institute (AHRI) to \nissue capacity ratings. All RTU’s were tested in sunny conditions with outside air temperatures between 83-87 degrees. \nThe boundary of the testing were the DX units and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance \ncalculations is very high.\nProperty of Powertron Global®", "tokens": 781, "chars": 3793, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "dataroom_022_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:ca9572115969ebf5fdc98047d46c7bbb08fb026fd5c28c362494611297685c89"}

The lower baseline operating \ntonnage and COP ratings are calculated based on historical data and are in line with the ASHRAE loss of \nperformance and cost to operate numbers. The degraded equipment performance was costing Major Global Bank A significant \nmoney and wasting energy in the four treated units before PermaFrost NMR® was added in 2008. The \nequipment was using significantly more kWh to operate than they did when they were new.\nThe performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the DX units in the baseline and \npost testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. The implementation of PermaFrost \nNMR® ECM in the four units averaging approximately 5 years of age at the time resulted in a restoration of \n3.94 operating tons and an average improvement of 15.4% in kilowatt per ton (kW/ton) significantly reducing \nthe cost to operate the units throughout the year.\nProperty of Powertron Global®\n\n\n\n5\nRecovered Wasted Energy with ECM \nThe chart to the right illustrates the performance \nrestoration the ECM created in the treated units. The \naverage cost to operate these units before they were \ntreated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in \nkW/ton, averaged 1.36.\nThe specific cost to operate these units after they \nwere treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated \nin kW/ton, is currently 1.15.\nThe higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ \nwas expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss \nof performance efficiency and cost to operate \nestimate for these  units.
