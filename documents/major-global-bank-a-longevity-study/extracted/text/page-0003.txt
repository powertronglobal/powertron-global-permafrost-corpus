Process
This report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of four similar DX units 
treated over six years ago with PermaFrost NMR® compared to where ASHRAE degradation averages had 
them performing prior to treatment. 
Detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the DX units after the 
installation of PermaFrost NMR® to determine the impact on the three key elements that greatly affect Major Global Bank A’s 
power bill as they relate to the original design specifications: 
 
1. The cooling capacity the units are capable of producing after an average of 10.5 years in service.
 
2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the units are delivering as  
 
    reflected in the kW/ton measurement. 
 
3. The thermal dynamic ability of the units to continue to perform at or close to operational design.
Methodology
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the 
IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted of Powertron 
Global’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer].  
Notes
The readings were taken in the same conditions used by Air-Conditioning, Heating, & Refrigeration Institute (AHRI) to 
issue capacity ratings. All RTU’s were tested in sunny conditions with outside air temperatures between 83-87 degrees. 
The boundary of the testing were the DX units and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance 
calculations is very high.
