Purpose of the Study
The purpose of this study is to verify that the restored capacity produced six years+ ago when all four plit 
system DX units were first treated with the PermaFrost NMR® is being sustained. This same efficiency 
improvement is then quantified into dollars saved by Major Global Bank A in the treated units. 
The split system units involved in this study are representative of a great majority of the portfolio of equipment 
operated by Major Global Bank A. The same information gathered in the study is then extrapolated out across the entire Major Global Bank A 
portfolio to closely estimate what capacity has already been lost in term of increased energy costs. This same 
extrapolation methodology is also used to estimate what the potential future avoided wasted energy costs are 
expected to be when treating all DX units types.  
Many industry leading organizations, including the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air 
Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), project that all heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration 
(HVACR) units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they operate and age. Thermal degradation is caused by a 
phenomenon that is present in all HVACR equipment that operates as a vapor compression cycle associated 
with refrigerant and oil for lubrication. This thermal degradation is well documented by the HVACR industry 
and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal degradation prevents units from operating at the 
original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times and additional kWh consumption.
