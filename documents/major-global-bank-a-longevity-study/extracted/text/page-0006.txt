Recovered Wasted Energy with ECM 
The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration the ECM created in the treated units. The 
average cost to operate these units before they were 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, averaged 1.36.
The specific cost to operate these units after they 
were treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated 
in kW/ton, is currently 1.15.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ 
was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss 
of performance efficiency and cost to operate 
estimate for these  units. The post results are also in 
line with the average improvement savings shown 
in more than 120,000 installations globally.
