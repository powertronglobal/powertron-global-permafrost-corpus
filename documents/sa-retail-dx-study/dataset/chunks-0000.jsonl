This transformation displaces layers of \nlubricating fluids that have been impinged in the evaporator and condenser heat \nexchanger metal surfaces. When the fluid is displaced, the evaporator and \ncondenser can transfer additional heat energy through the tube walls (thermal \nrestoration). This enables the evaporator to completely dehumidify the air per the \nunit’s design specifications.

The \nproprietary enzyme based cleaner is non corrosive and completely biodegradable.  \nA common form of fouling (exterior surface) arises from the formation of bacteria \nand fungi deep inside the coils. This biological form of fouling is exceptionally \nproblematic for HVAC systems. When microbes take root deep inside the coils they \nbegin to form biofilms, which is a plasticity type of membrane excreted by these \nmicro-organisms. Biofilms are particularly detrimental to the HVAC system because \nthese films are highly conductive which works to inhibit heat transfer between the \nmetal surfaces of the coil and the passing air flow. In addition, biofilms can have \nsticky surfaces that can accumulate dust and the other fouling debris, thereby \nacting to inhibit air flow and efficient heat transfer though the coils.", "tokens": 645, "chars": 2886, "pages": {"start": 8, "end": 9}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_003_chunk_0006", "next_id": "dataroom_003_chunk_0008", "content_hash": "sha256:c2370b37f3436ffa84258d02db823233ab2e96c11060158f3a707cbe7af05e39"}

The results of the confirmatory testing demonstrate the \nefficacy of PermaFrost NMR® by restoring the evaporator and condenser heat \ntransfer capabilities per manufacturer’s design, thereby restoring cooling capacity \nwhile lowering the electrical cost per ton of cooling.  \nAPPENDIX \nI. \nRTU 2 Performance Analysis Summary \nII.\nRTU 3 Performance Analysis Summary\nIII.\nRTU 4 Performance Analysis Summary\nIV.\nRTU 5 Performance Analysis Summary\nV. \nRTU 7 Performance Analysis Summary\nVI.\nRTU 10 Performance Analysis Summary\nVII.\nRTU 12 Performance Analysis Summary\nVIII.\nRTU 14 Performance Analysis Summary\nIX.\nRTU 15 Performance Analysis Summary\nX. \nRTU 16 Performance Analysis Summary\nXI.\nRTU 17 Performance Analysis Summary\nXII.\n33 points measured\n*(raw data files are made available)\n\n\n\nThis document is proprietary and confidential to Powertron Global, LLC and is not to be modified, distributed all or in part to any third party \nwithout prior written approval. © Copyright 2020 Powertron Global, LLC. \nAPPENDIX I\n\n\n\n9/21/2020\nPowertron Global\nhttps://fmv.powertronglobal.com/?obj=reports\n1/13\nRTU 2 Post\nBaseline 07/08/2020 12:00 AM - 07/15/2020 12:00 AM VS Post 09/12/2020 12:00\nAM - 09/19/2020 12:00 AM\nkW/Ton\nbaseline\npost\n\n\n\n9/21/2020\nPowertron Global\nhttps://fmv.powertronglobal.com/?obj=reports\n2/13\nkW/Ton Detail\nTemperature\nBaseline kW/Ton\nPost kW/Ton\n% kwton change\nBaseline Number of Samples\nPost Number of Samples\n75\n0.82\n5742\n76\n1.84\n0.86\n53\n56\n3916\n77\n1.09\n0.91\n17\n907\n2410\n78\n1.13\n0.85\n25\n2299\n2056\n79\n1.10\n0.89\n19\n3169\n2365\n80\n1.23\n0.91\n26\n1677\n2768\n81\n1.15\n0.92\n20\n1937\n2817\n82\n1.21\n0.93\n23\n1363\n4208\n83\n1.22\n0.94\n23\n922\n3252\n84\n1.28\n0.96\n25\n635\n4554\n85\n1.32\n0.96\n27\n981\n2938\n86\n1.35\n0.99\n27\n1612\n4034\n87\n1.31\n1.00\n24\n1459\n5238\n88\n1.29\n1.03\n20\n1723\n4852\n89\n1.32\n1.01\n23\n2446\n5184\n90\n1.29\n0.96\n26\n2192\n3986\n91\n1.28\n1.03\n20\n2860\n2787\n\n\n\n9/21/2020\nPowertron Global\nhttps://fmv.powertronglobal.com/?obj=reports\n3/13\nTemperature\nBaseline kW/Ton\nPost kW/Ton\n% kwton change\nBaseline Number of Samples\nPost Number of Samples\n92\n1.30\n1.05\n19\n2030\n1566\n93\n1.31\n1.04\n21\n2889\n1308\n94\n1.31\n1.10\n16\n1993\n621\n95\n1.29\n1.05\n19\n3120\n387\n96\n1.26\n1.07\n15\n2545\n76\n97\n1.30\n0.91\n30\n2181\n107\n98\n1.30\n0.91\n30\n2652\n80\n99\n1.33\n1.12\n16\n3305\n52\n\n\n\n9/21/2020\nPowertron Global\nhttps://fmv.powertronglobal.com/?obj=reports\n4/13\nTONS\nbaseline\npost", "tokens": 1078, "chars": 3115, "pages": {"start": 9, "end": 15}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_003_chunk_0007", "next_id": "dataroom_003_chunk_0009", "content_hash": "sha256:26f1853347710eca65bce2a2fa7140c67a6db9dba294866f4092c571d2da8b49"}
