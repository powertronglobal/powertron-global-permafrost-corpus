Conclusion 
The confirmatory testing results validate the performance improvements of the 
treated HVAC/R system and are in line with a previously tested UL (formally 
Underwriters Laboratories) unit as well as +300 P.E. reviewed case studies 
available upon request.  The results of the confirmatory testing demonstrate the 
efficacy of PermaFrost NMR® by restoring the evaporator and condenser heat 
transfer capabilities per manufacturer’s design, thereby restoring cooling capacity 
while lowering the electrical cost per ton of cooling.
