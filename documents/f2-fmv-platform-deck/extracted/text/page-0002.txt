If your business would like to bring its HVAC assets into the online world of IoT 
(Internet of Things) to better manage your equipment by your facility personnel, 
or if you are a mechanical ﬁrm that oﬀers commissioning, re-commissioning or 
Measurement & Veriﬁcation (M&V) services, Powertron Global’s F2 device and 
FMV Platform delivers IoT cloud based system at a fraction of the cost of installing 
new Pharma Company B/EMS solutions or hiring conventional engineering services of the past.  
70% of all HVAC in service is operating 30-50% oﬀ design and wasting energy.  
No more guessing, opinions or uniformed approaches to energy eﬃciency! Let the real time data drive 
your operational decisions. Diagnose system eﬃciency and performance, verify energy conservation 
measures, create alerts for proactive maintenance strategies, and audit existing Pharma Company B/EMS 
systems/sensors, or long-term real-time system monitoring and management. The F2 does it all!
Powertron Global is offering an affordable program of our F2 metering devices for HVAC 
equipment. Take advantage of what the IoT world has to oﬀer your business or mechanical ﬁrm.
Our Powertron F2 IoT Devices can be installed on most DX and Chiller (water or air-cooled) HVAC 
equipment including Air-handlers (AHU) in the ﬁeld today. Our devices can be a permanent or 
temporary (transferable to another piece of like equipment) installment.
Make your HVAC/R system smarter and it’s performance data accessible. The 
Powertron Global IoT solution provides enterprise level, real-time monitoring of several types of 
meters including but not limited to power, water, BTU, temperatures, ﬂows, and pressures. We also
