Let the real time data drive \nyour operational decisions. Diagnose system eﬃciency and performance, verify energy conservation \nmeasures, create alerts for proactive maintenance strategies, and audit existing Pharma Company B/EMS \nsystems/sensors, or long-term real-time system monitoring and management. The F2 does it all!\nPowertron Global is offering an affordable program of our F2 metering devices for HVAC \nequipment. Take advantage of what the IoT world has to oﬀer your business or mechanical ﬁrm.\nOur Powertron F2 IoT Devices can be installed on most DX and Chiller (water or air-cooled) HVAC \nequipment including Air-handlers (AHU) in the ﬁeld today. Our devices can be a permanent or \ntemporary (transferable to another piece of like equipment) installment.\nMake your HVAC/R system smarter and it’s performance data accessible. The \nPowertron Global IoT solution provides enterprise level, real-time monitoring of several types of \nmeters including but not limited to power, water, BTU, temperatures, ﬂows, and pressures. We also \nhave custom oﬀerings speciﬁcally designed to manage and monitor HVAC energy performance i.e. \nelectrical and mechanical.", "tokens": 466, "chars": 1959, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "dataroom_017_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:67bd0b11177adcc758b260b9a7336b048a749fa064e7410b26ca23ba56fa73bf"}
