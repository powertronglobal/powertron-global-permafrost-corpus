It is a major cause of \ncapacity loss in Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (HVACR) systems, preventing them \nfrom operating at the original design efficiency soon after installation.  The purpose of this study is to verify the \neffectiveness of the PermaFrost NMR® Energy Conservation Measure (ECM) in the European Chiller Manufacturer chiller #2 at the \nAfrican Telecom Provider [Pretoria Area] Switching Centre and document the future avoided energy costs associated with the same. \nSummary Results \nThis report contains specific information regarding a chiller BASE and POST performance profile at 100% \nload supporting the African Telecom Provider A in South Africa.  BASE to POST performance versus design:  \n•\n95.51% to 90.31% less power consumed\n•\n76.91% to 88.61% increased cooling capacity\n•\n80.43% to 101.71% improved energy to capacity cost efficiency\n•\n80.48% to 98.51% improved coefficient of performance (COP)\nAll testing was conducted by HVAC Contractor B’s Managing Director and Director of Engineering, [Technical Director], \nassisted by Senior Technician [Client Representative], while being witnessed by [Client Representative], [Facilities Manager] and \n[Facilities Rep] of Facilities Management Company A plus [Client Representative] and [Client Representative] of African Telecom Provider.  \nHVAC Contractor B supported the data collection process and installed the ECM into the chiller. HVAC Contractor B is the \nexclusive national distributor for European Chiller Manufacturer in South Africa. \nTesting - Goals \nThe BASE and POST testing determined the impact on 3 key elements relating to the original design \nspecifications that greatly affect the HVACR portion of the ETE switching centre power bill. They include: \n•\nThe cooling capacity the chiller is capable of producing after ten (10) years in service.\n•\nThe actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling the chiller is delivering as\nreflected in the amount of kWEnergy per kWRefrigeration required measurement (kWE/kWR).\n•\nThe thermal dynamic ability of the equipment to still perform at or close to operational design.\nTesting - Methodology (IPMVP) \nThe testing measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance \nwith the IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework.", "tokens": 789, "chars": 3403, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_107_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:49aed379b1205916fbfbc7a156e0aa80f55931af2d27935f664586ff7ffc125d"}

The baseline day \nchosen to test the chiller was an average day temperature and humidity-wise for the Midrand area in the \nspring which will ensure repeatability of similar weather for the POST testing measurements. The weather \nand facility conditions provided an adequate heat load to ensure the chiller the system would remain loaded \nand running during the actual data collection period.  The boundary of the testing was the chiller and \nnothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance calculations is very high. \nThe content detailed in this report will demonstrate the ability of the pilot chiller to perform prior to and \nafter the ECM being installed, as well as illustrate the thermal degradation that naturally occurs in heat exchangers over time.  The results were formulated by entering the measured data into the \nfollowing thermodynamic engineering formulas: \n•\nkWE = Volts*Amps*Power Factor *√3/1000\n(kWE = Kilowatt Energy) \n•\nkWR = Flow Rate*1*Delta-T*4.185\n(kWR = Kilowatt Refrigeration) \n•\nkWE/kWR = Efficiency\n(Cost to Operate) \n•\nkWR/kWE = Coefficient of Performance\n(COP)  \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\nBASE Measurement Testing – 16 September 2015 \n1.\nChillers #1 and #2 were running at the same set points.  FMC technicians changed the central controller\nsetting to give priority to chiller #2 about to be measured and treated.\n2.\nChiller #2 was cycling on and off too often too rapidly (HVAC Contractor B pointed this out at a their initial chiller\ndata gathering and inspection in June 2015), and upon checking the TA STAD 80 valve which is used to\nbalance and set the correct water flow for each chiller, they found the TA STAD 80 valve for chiller #2\ncompletely open (8.5 turns setting).\n3.\nFMC’s measuring tool determined chiller #2 evaporator water flow rate set at 18.39 l/s (litres per second),\nsome 348% over the desired 5.28 l/s design value, while coincidently, chiller #1 was set to 5.30 l/s.\n4.\nWith a 126.4 kW chiller capacity, 18.39 l/s (see picture right) flow rate produced a\ntemperature differential of 1.5°C at full load. This clarified why chiller #2 has\ncontinued to stop and start at such short intervals i.e. “slamming”.  It also explains\nwhy chiller #2 has not been able to be remotely controlled ( in this state it is\nuncontrollable) by FMC’s Measurement and Verification (M&V) team.\n5.\nHVAC Contractor B adjusted the valve close to the design value at 5.228 l/s (see picture at\nright) and chiller #2 immediately commenced running for longer periods.\n6.\nAs both chillers are called chiller 1 in the just installed new control system, their\ntemperature sensors were pulled and checked to ensure they updated correctly per\nthe ambient temperature, especially the leaving water temperature sensors, which\nwere independent to chiller #1 and #2, while the entering water temperature\nsensor was common to both chiller #1 and #2.\n7.\nAt the insistence of FMC senior engineering management, HVAC Contractor B were\ninstructed to set chiller #2 back to the very high 18.39 l/s flow rate at the end of the\nBASE measurements.", "tokens": 879, "chars": 3705, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_107_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_107_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:f969f4763f71e326848c17fffb7624e3922d92e8f9d8f782686e0f0221beb5fd"}

HVAC Contractor B is concerned this will endanger chiller #2 but\nhopes that the anti-recycle timers will prevent both chiller #2’s compressors from\noverheating and subsequently burning out.

These variations were repeatedly checked and confirmed by 2 different\nEuropean Chiller Manufacturer meters and one FMC meter.  The evaporator water supply temperature sensor was\ncleaned and reseated on 4 November 2015.\n3.\nUtilizing FMC’s measuring tool, the TA STAD 80 valve (which is used to balance and set the correct water\nflow rate) was set at 5.193 l/s (litres per second) compared to 5.228 l/s for the pre or BASE measurement.\n4.\nHVAC Contractor B allowed chiller #2 to stabilize and the evaporator water supply temperature to reach the BASE\n7.43°C (on the meter) before taking simultaneous measurement readings (circa 3:05PM on 4 Nov 2015):\n5.\nA - Evaporator Entering 11.70°C and Leaving 6.30°C Water temperatures producing a 5.40°C Delta-T,\nhowever the system stabilized thereafter at 5.20°C Delta-T which was most often recorded by three\ndifferent meters over the 2-day period, and was subsequently used for all thermodynamic formulae.\n6.\nB – 314 kPa/-5.5°C low and 1429 kPa/40.0°C high pressures/temperatures for circuit 1 refrigerant and\n395 kPa/-1.0°C low and 1518 kPa/41.9°C high pressures/temperatures for circuit 2 refrigerant.\n7.\nC - Volts: 389.33, 388.79, 386.17 = 388.10 average and Amps: 61.06, 63.80, 58.58  = 61.14 average.\n8.\nAfter all POST measurements were taken, circuit #1 was replenished with ± 2-3 kg.
