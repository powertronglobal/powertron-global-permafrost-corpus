BASE Measurement Testing – 16 September 2015 
1.
Chillers #1 and #2 were running at the same set points.  FMC technicians changed the central controller
setting to give priority to chiller #2 about to be measured and treated.
2.
Chiller #2 was cycling on and off too often too rapidly (HVAC Contractor B pointed this out at a their initial chiller
data gathering and inspection in June 2015), and upon checking the TA STAD 80 valve which is used to
balance and set the correct water flow for each chiller, they found the TA STAD 80 valve for chiller #2
completely open (8.5 turns setting).
3.
FMC’s measuring tool determined chiller #2 evaporator water flow rate set at 18.39 l/s (litres per second),
some 348% over the desired 5.28 l/s design value, while coincidently, chiller #1 was set to 5.30 l/s.
4.
With a 126.4 kW chiller capacity, 18.39 l/s (see picture right) flow rate produced a
temperature differential of 1.5°C at full load. This clarified why chiller #2 has
continued to stop and start at such short intervals i.e. “slamming”.  It also explains
why chiller #2 has not been able to be remotely controlled ( in this state it is
uncontrollable) by FMC’s Measurement and Verification (M&V) team.
5.
HVAC Contractor B adjusted the valve close to the design value at 5.228 l/s (see picture at
right) and chiller #2 immediately commenced running for longer periods.
6.
As both chillers are called chiller 1 in the just installed new control system, their
temperature sensors were pulled and checked to ensure they updated correctly per
the ambient temperature, especially the leaving water temperature sensors, which
were independent to chiller #1 and #2, while the entering water temperature
sensor was common to both chiller #1 and #2.
7.
At the insistence of FMC senior engineering management, HVAC Contractor B were
instructed to set chiller #2 back to the very high 18.39 l/s flow rate at the end of the
BASE measurements.  HVAC Contractor B is concerned this will endanger chiller #2 but
hopes that the anti-recycle timers will prevent both chiller #2’s compressors from
overheating and subsequently burning out.  As the chillers do not belong to
HVAC Contractor B, they were set back as requested, considering the combined experience
of the on-site FMC personnel as knowing and understanding the risk under which
they are operating.  While we consider this highly damaging to the chiller and
jeopardizing to its performance during the required PermaFrost NMR gestation
period and thereafter, at its completion, we will reset chiller #2 to the exact BASE
measuring conditions, including 5.228 l/s, before we take the POST measuring
conditions to verify the ECM results.  The attached IPMVP Pilot rules, sent to FMC
and accepted with their agreement to proceed with the Pilot, clearly defines these
same rules of engagement under which IPMVP operates under universal acceptance.
8.
HVAC Contractor B allowed chiller #2 to stabilize and evaporator water leaving temperature to approach 7.43°C
on the panel (In 11.5°C /Out 7.1°C measured) before taking simultaneous readings (circa 12:50PM):
•
A - Evaporator Entering 11.81°C and Leaving 7.43°C Water temperatures producing a 4.38°C Delta-T
Note: Chiller #1 and #2 are both #1 on the new controller.  Temperatures above are for chiller #2
•
B – 380 kPa/-1.1°C low and 1557 kPa/43.3°C high pressures/temperatures for circuit 1 refrigerant
and 410 kPa/0.8°C low and 1600 kPa/44.0°C high pressures/temperatures for circuit 2 refrigerant.
•
C - Volts: 394.51, 395.01, 391.78 = 393.77 average and Amps: 63.34, 67.02, 61.70 = 64.02 average.
