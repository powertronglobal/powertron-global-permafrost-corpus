Environmental Impact – Reduced Carbon Emissions form Reduced Energy Savings 
By saving 9,198 kilowatt-hours (kWh) annually, Chiller #2 will save 4,251 kg. carbon-
dioxide emissions. This is equivalent to one mid-size vehicle running for one full year. 
CONCLUSION 
The [Pretoria Area] ETE pilot European Chiller Manufacturer WRAT/B 0502 chiller behaved very close to ASHRAE’s predicted capacity 
loss.  Restoral of the thermal transfer capability of the heat exchangers after sufficient runtime hours increased the 
system’s capacity which will immediately lead to energy savings while increasing the system’s operating life and 
reducing emergency maintenance.  The overall effect will also dramatically reduce the chiller’s carbon footprint.  
The Energy Conservation Method (ECM) PermaFrost NMR® will provide significant CAPEX and OPEX benefits.
