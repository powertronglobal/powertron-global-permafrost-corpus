HVAC/R Efficiency Report (Preliminary) 
Purpose 
Thermal degradation is well documented by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air 
Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). It is a major cause of 
capacity loss in Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (HVACR) systems, preventing them 
from operating at the original design efficiency soon after installation.  The purpose of this study is to verify the 
effectiveness of the PermaFrost NMR® Energy Conservation Measure (ECM) in the European Chiller Manufacturer chiller #2 at the 
African Telecom Provider [Pretoria Area] Switching Centre and document the future avoided energy costs associated with the same. 
Summary Results 
This report contains specific information regarding a chiller BASE and POST performance profile at 100% 
load supporting the African Telecom Provider A in South Africa.  BASE to POST performance versus design:  
•
95.51% to 90.31% less power consumed
•
76.91% to 88.61% increased cooling capacity
•
80.43% to 101.71% improved energy to capacity cost efficiency
•
80.48% to 98.51% improved coefficient of performance (COP)
All testing was conducted by HVAC Contractor B’s Managing Director and Director of Engineering, [Technical Director], 
assisted by Senior Technician [Client Representative], while being witnessed by [Client Representative], [Facilities Manager] and 
[Facilities Rep] of Facilities Management Company A plus [Client Representative] and [Client Representative] of African Telecom Provider.  
HVAC Contractor B supported the data collection process and installed the ECM into the chiller. HVAC Contractor B is the 
exclusive national distributor for European Chiller Manufacturer in South Africa. 
Testing - Goals 
The BASE and POST testing determined the impact on 3 key elements relating to the original design 
specifications that greatly affect the HVACR portion of the ETE switching centre power bill. They include: 
•
The cooling capacity the chiller is capable of producing after ten (10) years in service.
•
The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling the chiller is delivering as
reflected in the amount of kWEnergy per kWRefrigeration required measurement (kWE/kWR).
•
The thermal dynamic ability of the equipment to still perform at or close to operational design.
Testing - Methodology (IPMVP) 
The testing measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance 
with the IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework.  The baseline day 
chosen to test the chiller was an average day temperature and humidity-wise for the Midrand area in the 
spring which will ensure repeatability of similar weather for the POST testing measurements. The weather 
and facility conditions provided an adequate heat load to ensure the chiller the system would remain loaded 
and running during the actual data collection period.  The boundary of the testing was the chiller and 
nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance calculations is very high. 
The content detailed in this report will demonstrate the ability of the pilot chiller to perform prior to and 
after the ECM being installed, as well as illustrate the thermal degradation that naturally occurs in heat
exchangers over time.  The results were formulated by entering the measured data into the 
following thermodynamic engineering formulas: 
•
kWE = Volts*Amps*Power Factor *√3/1000
(kWE = Kilowatt Energy) 
•
kWR = Flow Rate*1*Delta-T*4.185
(kWR = Kilowatt Refrigeration) 
•
kWE/kWR = Efficiency
(Cost to Operate) 
•
kWR/kWE = Coefficient of Performance
(COP)
