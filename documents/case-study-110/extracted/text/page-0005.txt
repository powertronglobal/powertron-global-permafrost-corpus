POST Measurement Testing – 3/4 November 2015 
1.
[Facilities Rep] (Facilities Management Company A) supported and witnessed the 2-day measurement.
2.
The reason for the 2-day requirement was twofold:
•
A cold front swept through Pretoria/[Pretoria Area] necessitating mid-PM measurements
to allow the POST Outside Ambient Temperature OAT to approach the BASE 27.0°C
OAT.  The highest OAT attained circa 3:05PM on 4 Nov. 2015 was 25.8°C although a
more conservative 26.0°C was subsequently used for all thermodynamic formulae.
•
Chiller #2’s evaporator water supply temperature sensor gave erratic readings ranging from mostly
too high; then too low; or changing very slowly compared to Chiller #2’s evaporator water return
temperature sensor; or not changing at all by sticking at ±2.00°C when measured instrument readings
showed a Δ-T of 5.20°C.  These variations were repeatedly checked and confirmed by 2 different
European Chiller Manufacturer meters and one FMC meter.  The evaporator water supply temperature sensor was
cleaned and reseated on 4 November 2015.
3.
Utilizing FMC’s measuring tool, the TA STAD 80 valve (which is used to balance and set the correct water
flow rate) was set at 5.193 l/s (litres per second) compared to 5.228 l/s for the pre or BASE measurement.
4.
HVAC Contractor B allowed chiller #2 to stabilize and the evaporator water supply temperature to reach the BASE
7.43°C (on the meter) before taking simultaneous measurement readings (circa 3:05PM on 4 Nov 2015):
5.
A - Evaporator Entering 11.70°C and Leaving 6.30°C Water temperatures producing a 5.40°C Delta-T,
however the system stabilized thereafter at 5.20°C Delta-T which was most often recorded by three
different meters over the 2-day period, and was subsequently used for all thermodynamic formulae.
6.
B – 314 kPa/-5.5°C low and 1429 kPa/40.0°C high pressures/temperatures for circuit 1 refrigerant and
395 kPa/-1.0°C low and 1518 kPa/41.9°C high pressures/temperatures for circuit 2 refrigerant.
7.
C - Volts: 389.33, 388.79, 386.17 = 388.10 average and Amps: 61.06, 63.80, 58.58  = 61.14 average.
8.
After all POST measurements were taken, circuit #1 was replenished with ± 2-3 kg. Of R-22 refrigerant.
As both chillers #1 and #2 were fully serviced prior to the BASE measurement, there is presumed to be a
leak in the system.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE DURING EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE
9.
Considering the evaporator supply water temperature sensor’s erratic behaviour it is recommended to
replace the four (4) evaporator and condenser water supply and return temperature sensors as these bear
huge operating cost implications.  They should be placed in a closed environment side-by-side and
equally calibrated.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE DURING EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE
10. The newly installed chiller controller at the electrical panel is not providing accurate refrigerant pressure
and temperature readings.  It is unsure precisely how both chillers can be remotely monitored, measured
and managed.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE DURING EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE
