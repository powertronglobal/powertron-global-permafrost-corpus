HVAC/R Efficiency Report (Preliminary) 
Purpose

Thermal degradation is well documented by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air 
Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). It is a major cause of 
capacity loss in Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (HVACR) systems, preventing them 
from operating at the original design efficiency soon after installation.  The purpose of this study is to verify the 
effectiveness of the PermaFrost NMR® Energy Conservation Measure (ECM) in the European Chiller Manufacturer chiller #2 at the 
African Telecom Provider [Pretoria Area] Switching Centre and document the future avoided energy costs associated with the same.

Summary Results

This report contains specific information regarding a chiller BASE and POST performance profile at 100% 
load supporting the African Telecom Provider A in South Africa.  BASE to POST performance versus design:

•
95.51% to 90.31% less power consumed
•
76.91% to 88.61% increased cooling capacity
•
80.43% to 101.71% improved energy to capacity cost efficiency
•
80.48% to 98.51% improved coefficient of performance (COP)

All testing was conducted by HVAC Contractor B’s Managing Director and Director of Engineering, [Technical Director], 
assisted by Senior Technician [Client Representative], while being witnessed by [Client Representative], [Facilities Manager] and 
[Facilities Rep] of Facilities Management Company A plus [Client Representative] and [Client Representative] of African Telecom Provider.  
HVAC Contractor B supported the data collection process and installed the ECM into the chiller. HVAC Contractor B is the 
exclusive national distributor for European Chiller Manufacturer in South Africa.

Testing - Goals

The BASE and POST testing determined the impact on 3 key elements relating to the original design 
specifications that greatly affect the HVACR portion of the ETE switching centre power bill. They include:

•
The cooling capacity the chiller is capable of producing after ten (10) years in service.
•
The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling the chiller is delivering as
reflected in the amount of kWEnergy per kWRefrigeration required measurement (kWE/kWR).
•
The thermal dynamic ability of the equipment to still perform at or close to operational design.

Testing - Methodology (IPMVP)

The testing measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance 
with the IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework.  The baseline day 
chosen to test the chiller was an average day temperature and humidity-wise for the Midrand area in the 
spring which will ensure repeatability of similar weather for the POST testing measurements. The weather 
and facility conditions provided an adequate heat load to ensure the chiller the system would remain loaded 
and running during the actual data collection period.  The boundary of the testing was the chiller and 
nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance calculations is very high.

The content detailed in this report will demonstrate the ability of the pilot chiller to perform prior to and 
after the ECM being installed, as well as illustrate the thermal degradation that naturally occurs in heat exchangers over time.  The results were formulated by entering the measured data into the 
following thermodynamic engineering formulas:

•
kWE = Volts*Amps*Power Factor *√3/1000
(kWE = Kilowatt Energy) 
•
kWR = Flow Rate*1*Delta-T*4.185
(kWR = Kilowatt Refrigeration) 
•
kWE/kWR = Efficiency
(Cost to Operate) 
•
kWR/kWE = Coefficient of Performance
(COP)

BASE Measurement Testing – 16 September 2015

1.
Chillers #1 and #2 were running at the same set points.  FMC technicians changed the central controller
setting to give priority to chiller #2 about to be measured and treated.
2.
Chiller #2 was cycling on and off too often too rapidly (HVAC Contractor B pointed this out at a their initial chiller
data gathering and inspection in June 2015), and upon checking the TA STAD 80 valve which is used to
balance and set the correct water flow for each chiller, they found the TA STAD 80 valve for chiller #2
completely open (8.5 turns setting).
3.
FMC’s measuring tool determined chiller #2 evaporator water flow rate set at 18.39 l/s (litres per second),
some 348% over the desired 5.28 l/s design value, while coincidently, chiller #1 was set to 5.30 l/s.
4.
With a 126.4 kW chiller capacity, 18.39 l/s (see picture right) flow rate produced a
temperature differential of 1.5°C at full load. This clarified why chiller #2 has
continued to stop and start at such short intervals i.e. “slamming”.  It also explains
why chiller #2 has not been able to be remotely controlled ( in this state it is
uncontrollable) by FMC’s Measurement and Verification (M&V) team.
5.
HVAC Contractor B adjusted the valve close to the design value at 5.228 l/s (see picture at
right) and chiller #2 immediately commenced running for longer periods.
6.
As both chillers are called chiller 1 in the just installed new control system, their
temperature sensors were pulled and checked to ensure they updated correctly per
the ambient temperature, especially the leaving water temperature sensors, which
were independent to chiller #1 and #2, while the entering water temperature
sensor was common to both chiller #1 and #2.
7.
At the insistence of FMC senior engineering management, HVAC Contractor B were
instructed to set chiller #2 back to the very high 18.39 l/s flow rate at the end of the
BASE measurements.  HVAC Contractor B is concerned this will endanger chiller #2 but
hopes that the anti-recycle timers will prevent both chiller #2’s compressors from
overheating and subsequently burning out.  As the chillers do not belong to
HVAC Contractor B, they were set back as requested, considering the combined experience
of the on-site FMC personnel as knowing and understanding the risk under which
they are operating.  While we consider this highly damaging to the chiller and
jeopardizing to its performance during the required PermaFrost NMR gestation
period and thereafter, at its completion, we will reset chiller #2 to the exact BASE
measuring conditions, including 5.228 l/s, before we take the POST measuring
conditions to verify the ECM results.  The attached IPMVP Pilot rules, sent to FMC
and accepted with their agreement to proceed with the Pilot, clearly defines these
same rules of engagement under which IPMVP operates under universal acceptance.
8.
HVAC Contractor B allowed chiller #2 to stabilize and evaporator water leaving temperature to approach 7.43°C
on the panel (In 11.5°C /Out 7.1°C measured) before taking simultaneous readings (circa 12:50PM):
•
A - Evaporator Entering 11.81°C and Leaving 7.43°C Water temperatures producing a 4.38°C Delta-T
Note: Chiller #1 and #2 are both #1 on the new controller.  Temperatures above are for chiller #2
•
B – 380 kPa/-1.1°C low and 1557 kPa/43.3°C high pressures/temperatures for circuit 1 refrigerant
and 410 kPa/0.8°C low and 1600 kPa/44.0°C high pressures/temperatures for circuit 2 refrigerant.
•
C - Volts: 394.51, 395.01, 391.78 = 393.77 average and Amps: 63.34, 67.02, 61.70 = 64.02 average.

POST Measurement Testing – 3/4 November 2015

1.
[Facilities Rep] (Facilities Management Company A) supported and witnessed the 2-day measurement.
2.
The reason for the 2-day requirement was twofold:
•
A cold front swept through Pretoria/[Pretoria Area] necessitating mid-PM measurements
to allow the POST Outside Ambient Temperature OAT to approach the BASE 27.0°C
OAT.  The highest OAT attained circa 3:05PM on 4 Nov. 2015 was 25.8°C although a
more conservative 26.0°C was subsequently used for all thermodynamic formulae.
•
Chiller #2’s evaporator water supply temperature sensor gave erratic readings ranging from mostly
too high; then too low; or changing very slowly compared to Chiller #2’s evaporator water return
temperature sensor; or not changing at all by sticking at ±2.00°C when measured instrument readings
showed a Δ-T of 5.20°C.  These variations were repeatedly checked and confirmed by 2 different
European Chiller Manufacturer meters and one FMC meter.  The evaporator water supply temperature sensor was
cleaned and reseated on 4 November 2015.

3.
Utilizing FMC’s measuring tool, the TA STAD 80 valve (which is used to balance and set the correct water
flow rate) was set at 5.193 l/s (litres per second) compared to 5.228 l/s for the pre or BASE measurement.
4.
HVAC Contractor B allowed chiller #2 to stabilize and the evaporator water supply temperature to reach the BASE
7.43°C (on the meter) before taking simultaneous measurement readings (circa 3:05PM on 4 Nov 2015):
5.
A - Evaporator Entering 11.70°C and Leaving 6.30°C Water temperatures producing a 5.40°C Delta-T,
however the system stabilized thereafter at 5.20°C Delta-T which was most often recorded by three
different meters over the 2-day period, and was subsequently used for all thermodynamic formulae.
6.
B – 314 kPa/-5.5°C low and 1429 kPa/40.0°C high pressures/temperatures for circuit 1 refrigerant and
395 kPa/-1.0°C low and 1518 kPa/41.9°C high pressures/temperatures for circuit 2 refrigerant.
7.
C - Volts: 389.33, 388.79, 386.17 = 388.10 average and Amps: 61.06, 63.80, 58.58  = 61.14 average.

8.
After all POST measurements were taken, circuit #1 was replenished with ± 2-3 kg. Of R-22 refrigerant.
As both chillers #1 and #2 were fully serviced prior to the BASE measurement, there is presumed to be a
leak in the system.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE DURING EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE
9.
Considering the evaporator supply water temperature sensor’s erratic behaviour it is recommended to
replace the four (4) evaporator and condenser water supply and return temperature sensors as these bear
huge operating cost implications.  They should be placed in a closed environment side-by-side and
equally calibrated.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE DURING EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE
10. The newly installed chiller controller at the electrical panel is not providing accurate refrigerant pressure
and temperature readings.  It is unsure precisely how both chillers can be remotely monitored, measured
and managed.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE DURING EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE

Environmental Impact – Reduced Carbon Emissions form Reduced Energy Savings

By saving 9,198 kilowatt-hours (kWh) annually, Chiller #2 will save 4,251 kg. carbon-
dioxide emissions. This is equivalent to one mid-size vehicle running for one full year.

CONCLUSION

The [Pretoria Area] ETE pilot European Chiller Manufacturer WRAT/B 0502 chiller behaved very close to ASHRAE’s predicted capacity 
loss.  Restoral of the thermal transfer capability of the heat exchangers after sufficient runtime hours increased the 
system’s capacity which will immediately lead to energy savings while increasing the system’s operating life and 
reducing emergency maintenance.  The overall effect will also dramatically reduce the chiller’s carbon footprint.  
The Energy Conservation Method (ECM) PermaFrost NMR® will provide significant CAPEX and OPEX benefits.
