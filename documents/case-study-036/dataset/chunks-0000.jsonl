The evaporator leaving air enthalpy is measured \nby the outlet air enthalpy sensor. The inlet and outlet enthalpies are subtracted \nfrom each other resulting in a sum called the Enthalpy delta. This enthalpy delta \n(∆) is used in the shown formula below. Other components of this formula \ncomplete the equation. These include the volume of air passing through the \nevaporator (CFM or Cubic feet of air per minute) and an engineering standard ratio \nof 4.5 (Ratio of Standard Air) or constant.  The result of this calculation yields the \nindustry standard the British Thermal Unit (BTU), which is used to calculate the \nunit’s capacity in BTU. This BTU number is then divided by the constant 12,000 \nwhich is to convert to refrigeration tons because every 12,000 BTUs equals 1 Ton \nof HVAC capacity.
