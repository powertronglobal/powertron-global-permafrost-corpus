1.      Introduction

Caribbean Telecom Group conducted three confirmatory tests from March 6, 2018 to March 
27, 2018 located in [Jamaica Location] to verify Powertron Global’s PermaFrost 
NMR® energy efficiency improvement effect on three DX system’s refrigeration

The testing included monitoring the operation before and after (PRE and POST) 
PermaFrost NMR® treatment to verify the amount of cooling capacity (tons) 
restoration and the resultant kW/ton energy savings improvement.

The Measurement and Verification (M&V) protocol defined the boundary by 
isolating the entry and departure points of the medium being cooled to determine 
cooling performance and comparing that with the power being used to quantify 
the power costs per unit of cooling, kW/ton (kilowatt-per-ton), EER (Energy 
Efficiency Ratio) and COP (Co-Efficient of Performance).

1. Method of Procedure for testing:

The objective of measuring the overall cooling production of HVAC/R systems 
can be realized by measuring the total energy consumed by the specific unit 
being tested and the total BTUH production of the system then calculating these 
parameters to obtain current capacity, kW/ton, EER (energy efficient ratio) and 
COP (coefficient of performance). Using that information the total BTUH of 
cooling production can be realized. The objective of measuring overall power 
consumed by an HVAC/R system can be realized by measuring voltage, 
amperage and power factor.  
 
For these HVAC/R systems parameters were measured every 5 seconds for a 
period of seven (7) and four (4) days to develop a scientific baseline and to 
capture post data measurements. Data was extracted from the same parameters 
every fifteen (15) seconds during all operating hours.

The outdoor air temperature entering the air-cooled condenser coils of each unit 
will affect the design capacity. An analysis is provided of the seven (7) day & four 
(4) day periods of performance profiles of subsequent kW/ton, EER and COP 
across a variation of outdoor air temperatures spanning a twenty-five (25) degree 
span (70ºF-95ºF). 
 
Total BTUH was developed along with total kW consumption by measuring all 
required data points (35 points - see appendix for points measured) and entering 
them into industry best practice engineering formulae. All measurement hardware 
was certified under NIST or CE standards. Engineering formulae was developed 
by AHRI / ASHRAE (American Heating and Refrigeration Institute / American 
Society of Heating Refrigeration & Air Conditioning Engineers):

Kilo-watt (kW) = Volts (V) x Amps (A) x Power Factor (PF) x √3 / 1000

British Thermal Units (BTU) = CFM x 4.5 x Enthalpy Delta

Capacity / Tons = BTU / 12,000

Kilo-watt per Ton (kW/Ton) = kW Energy / Tons (capacity)

Co-Efficient of Performance (COP) = 12/kW per ton/ 3.412

Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) = BTU / Watts

To Determine Capacity: 
 
The evaporator entering air volume and the return enthalpy are measured by the 
CFM and inlet enthalpy sensors. The evaporator leaving air enthalpy is measured 
by the outlet air enthalpy sensor. The inlet and outlet enthalpies are subtracted 
from each other resulting in a sum called the Enthalpy delta. This enthalpy delta 
(∆) is used in the shown formula below. Other components of this formula 
complete the equation. These include the volume of air passing through the 
evaporator (CFM or Cubic feet of air per minute) and an engineering standard ratio 
of 4.5 (Ratio of Standard Air) or constant.  The result of this calculation yields the 
industry standard the British Thermal Unit (BTU), which is used to calculate the 
unit’s capacity in BTU. This BTU number is then divided by the constant 12,000 
which is to convert to refrigeration tons because every 12,000 BTUs equals 1 Ton 
of HVAC capacity. The capacity formula is: 
 
 
CFM x 4.5 x Enthalpy ∆ = BTUs / 12,000 = Tons (capacity) 
 
 
CFM – Cubic Feet per Minute of Air Flow or Air Volume 
4.5 – Ratio of Standard Air (constant) 
Enthalpy ∆ - Enthalpy Delta of the Inlet – Outlet Enthalpy

BTU – British Thermal Units  
12,000 – every 12,000 BTUs equals 1 Ton (constant) 
 
Example 
 
4000 (CFM) X 4.5 (Standard Air Ratio) X 8 (Enthalpy Delta) = 144,000 BTU, then 
divide by 12,000 = 12 tons

To Determine Electrical Energy Consumption: 
 
Total electrical consumption is measured at the main source of electric service of 
each rooftop unit. This includes, voltage, amperage and power factor and a 
constant of the square root of 3 (√3). This is then divided by 1000 to obtain 
kilowatts. The electrical formula for kilowatt (kW) is:

kW = V x A x PF x √3 / 1000 
 
V – Voltage 
A – Amperage 
PF – Power Factor 
√3 – Square Root of 3 for 3-phase Input Power 
1000 – constant  
 
 
Example 
 
480 (volts) X 45 (amps) X √3 (phase angle for three phase power only) X 0.90 
(power factor) / 1000 = 33.67 kilowatts

To Determine Efficiency: 
 
Divide the measured kilowatts (kW) by the measured tons to obtain kW per ton. 
kW per ton is the industry standard to determine system efficiency.

Example

33.67 kW / 12 tons = 2.80 kilowatts per ton

4.    Technical

When PermaFrost NMR® is installed into a unit, a molecular transformation 
develops. This transformation displaces layers of lubricating fluids that have been 
impinged in the evaporator and condenser heat exchanger metal surfaces. When 
the fluid is displaced, the evaporator and condenser can transfer additional heat

energy through the tube walls (thermal restoration). This enables the evaporator to 
completely dehumidify the air per the unit’s design specifications.  When more 
dehumidification is developed, the enthalpy (a measure of how many grains of 
moisture are contained in a pound of air) increases. 
 
If the CFM and 4.5 remain constant, then it is the effect of PermaFrost NMR®’s 
Enthalpy Delta increase that restores (increases) the lost capacity (Tons).  
 
If the tonnage increases, then the kW/ton decreases by means of mathematical 
function, demonstrating PermaFrost NMR®’s post-treatment effect lowering the 
electrical cost of every ton of cooling produced, no matter how many tons are 
called for at any given time.  
  
PermaFrost NMR® cannot change any unit’s electrical characteristics i.e. 
everything that requires electricity is rated for the required power under different 
loads e.g. compressors and fans.  
 
 
 
 
5.    Conclusion

The Caribbean Telecom Group’s test results for the three (3) treated HVAC/R systems are 
consistent with previously tested systems at Caribbean Telecom Provider in 2015-16, UL (formerly, 
Underwriters Laboratories) lab & field tests and the more than 300 independent 3rd 
party M&V studies which have been conducted on PermaFrost NMR® to restore 
the evaporator and condenser heat transfer capabilities, thereby increasing 
cooling capacity while lowering the electrical cost per ton of cooling (kW/ton).
