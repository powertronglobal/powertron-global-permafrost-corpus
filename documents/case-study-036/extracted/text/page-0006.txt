energy through the tube walls (thermal restoration). This enables the evaporator to 
completely dehumidify the air per the unit’s design specifications.  When more 
dehumidification is developed, the enthalpy (a measure of how many grains of 
moisture are contained in a pound of air) increases. 
 
If the CFM and 4.5 remain constant, then it is the effect of PermaFrost NMR®’s 
Enthalpy Delta increase that restores (increases) the lost capacity (Tons).  
 
If the tonnage increases, then the kW/ton decreases by means of mathematical 
function, demonstrating PermaFrost NMR®’s post-treatment effect lowering the 
electrical cost of every ton of cooling produced, no matter how many tons are 
called for at any given time.  
  
PermaFrost NMR® cannot change any unit’s electrical characteristics i.e. 
everything that requires electricity is rated for the required power under different 
loads e.g. compressors and fans.  
 
 
 
 
5.    Conclusion 
 
The Caribbean Telecom Group’s test results for the three (3) treated HVAC/R systems are 
consistent with previously tested systems at Caribbean Telecom Provider in 2015-16, UL (formerly, 
Underwriters Laboratories) lab & field tests and the more than 300 independent 3rd 
party M&V studies which have been conducted on PermaFrost NMR® to restore 
the evaporator and condenser heat transfer capabilities, thereby increasing 
cooling capacity while lowering the electrical cost per ton of cooling (kW/ton).
