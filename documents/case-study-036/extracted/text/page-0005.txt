BTU – British Thermal Units  
12,000 – every 12,000 BTUs equals 1 Ton (constant) 
 
Example 
 
4000 (CFM) X 4.5 (Standard Air Ratio) X 8 (Enthalpy Delta) = 144,000 BTU, then 
divide by 12,000 = 12 tons 
 
 
To Determine Electrical Energy Consumption: 
 
Total electrical consumption is measured at the main source of electric service of 
each rooftop unit. This includes, voltage, amperage and power factor and a 
constant of the square root of 3 (√3). This is then divided by 1000 to obtain 
kilowatts. The electrical formula for kilowatt (kW) is: 
 
kW = V x A x PF x √3 / 1000 
 
V – Voltage 
A – Amperage 
PF – Power Factor 
√3 – Square Root of 3 for 3-phase Input Power 
1000 – constant  
 
 
Example 
 
480 (volts) X 45 (amps) X √3 (phase angle for three phase power only) X 0.90 
(power factor) / 1000 = 33.67 kilowatts  
 
 
To Determine Efficiency: 
 
Divide the measured kilowatts (kW) by the measured tons to obtain kW per ton. 
kW per ton is the industry standard to determine system efficiency.  
 
Example 
 
33.67 kW / 12 tons = 2.80 kilowatts per ton   
 
 
 
 
4.    Technical 
 
When PermaFrost NMR® is installed into a unit, a molecular transformation 
develops. This transformation displaces layers of lubricating fluids that have been 
impinged in the evaporator and condenser heat exchanger metal surfaces. When 
the fluid is displaced, the evaporator and condenser can transfer additional heat
