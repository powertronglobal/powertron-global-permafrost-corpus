The testing included monitoring the operation before and after (PRE and POST) 
PermaFrost NMR® treatment to verify the amount of cooling capacity (tons) 
restoration and the resultant kW/ton energy savings improvement.  
 
The Measurement and Verification (M&V) protocol defined the boundary by 
isolating the entry and departure points of the medium being cooled to determine 
cooling performance and comparing that with the power being used to quantify 
the power costs per unit of cooling, kW/ton (kilowatt-per-ton), EER (Energy 
Efficiency Ratio) and COP (Co-Efficient of Performance). 
 
 
 
1. Method of Procedure for testing: 
 
The objective of measuring the overall cooling production of HVAC/R systems 
can be realized by measuring the total energy consumed by the specific unit 
being tested and the total BTUH production of the system then calculating these 
parameters to obtain current capacity, kW/ton, EER (energy efficient ratio) and 
COP (coefficient of performance). Using that information the total BTUH of 
cooling production can be realized. The objective of measuring overall power 
consumed by an HVAC/R system can be realized by measuring voltage, 
amperage and power factor.  
 
For these HVAC/R systems parameters were measured every 5 seconds for a 
period of seven (7) and four (4) days to develop a scientific baseline and to 
capture post data measurements. Data was extracted from the same parameters 
every fifteen (15) seconds during all operating hours.
