A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any \ntype of system in which it is installed – DX (direct expansion air and chilled water systems), Chillers \n(screw, reciprocating, scroll and centrifugal), heat pumps, ice making equipment.  Specialized \napplications include computer room cooling and dehumidification systems, chiller plants (water and ice \nproduction applications), domestic and industrial refrigeration (ammonia low and ultra low \ntemperature), air-cooled single application water chillers and split and package rooftop HVAC \nequipment.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity, and \nimproved refrigerant velocity – all of which allows a system to achieve set point temperatures in a more \nrapid fashion that reduces system loading and operating periods.  The indirect benefits resulting from \nthe enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW \nhours used, less amp draw at the compressor, less metallic wear and longer overall equipment life.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 477, "chars": 2267, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_023_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:c52d3f9ac90e6311203ca67d8443c88ba01e29dad57d1c9a6fbe378e5b0ef9c4"}

The unit is owned and maintained by \nRegional Healthcare Provider (heretofore referred to as The School) located in Ridgely, MD. [Director of Facilities], Director of \nFacilities, oversaw the trial. \nThe improved/restored efficiency on the unit directly attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was \nsubstantial.  The unit now provides cooler supply air with greater efficiency due to the restoration of the \nheat transfer capacity of the evaporator and condenser coils and increased the available useful tonnage. \nThe pool area was in use in the Post testing period and unoccupied during Pre testing.  When the pool is in \nuse the door to the locker room and the hallway entering the entrance area to the locker room is wedged \nopen in case of an emergency and the possible need of emergency response.  This allows the very moist and \nwarm air to enter the building finance side of the building.  During the Post testing period there was an \nenormous load coming from the pool. \nThe overall system efficiency improved by 18% and the EER improved by 48.7%.  There was an increase in \ncoil capacity of 16,200 in Btuh which equates to gaining 1.35-tons of capacity or 20.9%.  There is also a \nreduction of 32.7% in total power and watts per ton which is another measurable way to view the \nthermodynamic enhancement of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The tables of data and financial calculations \nare available for review at the end of this report.  The result of these combined ECM improvements is an \nROI to The School of 1.7 years.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 516, "chars": 2304, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_023_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_023_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:c72247eeb1b94dae1e49178c946b3c875caa552022cc590d6b681fe2697a4515"}

The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and \nAir-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the \nIPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and \nproducts.\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize.  They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.  Option B is \ndefined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single \nsource of measurement.  Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM \naffected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using \nmeasurements of proxies of energy use. \nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+ - Routine adjustments + - Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 436, "chars": 2149, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_023_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_023_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:537ceaf02bdd2b56992457eb06ab8b8ff0f9bd955e7e3ebe64e7beef4cb5616f"}

A diagnostic examination of \nthe pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the unit’s operational conditions were satisfactory. \nBaseline measurements were recorded and then the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR™ was \ninjected.  The product was then allowed four (4) weeks to seat itself into the metal surfaces before post \nmeasurements were taken to establish the efficiency gains.\nThe following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP International Performance Measurement and \nVerification Protocol as the M&V plan.
