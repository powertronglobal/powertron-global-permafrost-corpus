Performance Report on PermaFrost NMR® ECM

York Split System Servicing Finance Oﬃce

July 27, 2012

Product Brief

PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface science Energy Control Measure

(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) technology as its core agent.  A sustainable,

one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any

type of system in which it is installed – DX (direct expansion air and chilled water systems), Chillers

(screw, reciprocating, scroll and centrifugal), heat pumps, ice making equipment.  Specialized

applications include computer room cooling and dehumidification systems, chiller plants (water and ice

production applications), domestic and industrial refrigeration (ammonia low and ultra low

temperature), air-cooled single application water chillers and split and package rooftop HVAC

equipment.

The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity, and

improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allows a system to achieve set point temperatures in a more

rapid fashion that reduces system loading and operating periods.  The indirect benefits resulting from

the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW

hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, less metallic wear and longer overall equipment life.

Executive Summary

This report contains specific information regarding the installation of PermaFrost NMR® in the 7.5-ton York

DX Split HVAC unit at Regional Healthcare Provider School Finance Office.  The unit is owned and maintained by

Regional Healthcare Provider (heretofore referred to as The School) located in Ridgely, MD. [Director of Facilities], Director of

Facilities, oversaw the trial.

The improved/restored efficiency on the unit directly attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was

substantial.  The unit now provides cooler supply air with greater efficiency due to the restoration of the

heat transfer capacity of the evaporator and condenser coils and increased the available useful tonnage.

The pool area was in use in the Post testing period and unoccupied during Pre testing.  When the pool is in

use the door to the locker room and the hallway entering the entrance area to the locker room is wedged

open in case of an emergency and the possible need of emergency response.  This allows the very moist and

warm air to enter the building finance side of the building.  During the Post testing period there was an

enormous load coming from the pool.

The overall system efficiency improved by 18% and the EER improved by 48.7%.  There was an increase in

coil capacity of 16,200 in Btuh which equates to gaining 1.35-tons of capacity or 20.9%.  There is also a

reduction of 32.7% in total power and watts per ton which is another measurable way to view the

thermodynamic enhancement of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The tables of data and financial calculations

are available for review at the end of this report.  The result of these combined ECM improvements is an

ROI to The School of 1.7 years.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol

The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocols (IPMVP) are used to develop this

report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and

Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the

IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and

products.

There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize.  They

are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.  Option B is

defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single

source of measurement.  Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM

affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.

Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the

savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term

measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by

short-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using

measurements of proxies of energy use.

The final computation follows the formula:

Energy Science Division

Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy

+ - Routine adjustments + - Non-Routine Adjustments

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content

The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR™ to correct the

effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces.

The School made the decision to treat the unit as it was the on the same meter as the pool unit so the school

can also monitor that meter for a reduction in kWh when adjusted for weather.  A diagnostic examination of

the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the unit’s operational conditions were satisfactory.

Baseline measurements were recorded and then the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR™ was

injected.  The product was then allowed four (4) weeks to seat itself into the metal surfaces before post

measurements were taken to establish the efficiency gains.

The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP International Performance Measurement and

Verification Protocol as the M&V plan.  The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global’s Senior

Energy Engineer [Senior Energy Engineer] ME/CEM/CMC/CMVP.

The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:

kW = Volts X Amps x 1.56 (Three Phase) / 1000

Delta T = Return Air DB – Supply Air DB

Enthalpy = Return Air WB Deg. F and Supply Air WB Deg. F Converted to Enthalpy

Actual Btuh Capacity = Measured CFM X 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta

System Eﬃciency % = Actual Coil Capacity Btuh / Nominal Coil Capacity Btuh

EER = Btuh / Watts

Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to determine a very accurate ROI for

The Company for implementing this ECM:

Baseline kWh = (8517.6 CTW / 1,000) * 1,440 Annual Operating Hrs = 12,265 kWh

Baseline Cost To Run = 12,265 kWh * $.11 = $1,349

Regression Analysis is then used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Unit #1

Adjusted Base Tonnage = 7.81 tons (ERP) – 6.46 (base) = 1.35 tons + 6.46 tons = 7.81 tons

Adjusted Total Watts = 1,318.5 WPT * 7.81 tons = 10,297 W

Adjusted Base kWh = (10,297 W/1,000) * 1,440 Annual Operating Hrs = 14,828 kWh

Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM = 14,828 kWh * $.11 = $1,631

Post ECM kWh = (6,927.8 W / 1,000) * 1,440 Annual Operating Hrs = 9,976 kWh

Cost to Run After ECM = 9,976 kWh * $.11 = $1,097

Cost Savings per Month = ($1,631 - $1,097) / 12 = $44.50

Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed @ $840 / $44.50 = 18.9

ROI = 18.9 months
