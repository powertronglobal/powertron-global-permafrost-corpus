Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to determine a very accurate ROI for 
The Company for implementing this ECM:
Baseline kWh = (8517.6 CTW / 1,000) * 1,440 Annual Operating Hrs = 12,265 kWh
Baseline Cost To Run = 12,265 kWh * $.11 = $1,349
Regression Analysis is then used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Unit #1
Adjusted Base Tonnage = 7.81 tons (ERP) – 6.46 (base) = 1.35 tons + 6.46 tons = 7.81 tons
Adjusted Total Watts = 1,318.5 WPT * 7.81 tons = 10,297 W
Adjusted Base kWh = (10,297 W/1,000) * 1,440 Annual Operating Hrs = 14,828 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM = 14,828 kWh * $.11 = $1,631
Post ECM kWh = (6,927.8 W / 1,000) * 1,440 Annual Operating Hrs = 9,976 kWh
Cost to Run After ECM = 9,976 kWh * $.11 = $1,097
Cost Savings per Month = ($1,631 - $1,097) / 12 = $44.50
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed @ $840 / $44.50 = 18.9
 
ROI = 18.9 months
