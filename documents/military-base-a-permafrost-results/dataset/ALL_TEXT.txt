PermaFrost® Results
      In order to analyze the benefits of PermaFrost®, Military Base A agreed to treat a number of 
buildings and monitor the effects over a 6 month period.  The decision was made to pick facilities that had  
heat pumps and get performance data in the heating mode and the cooling mode.  The goal was to examine 
pre & post kWh consumption for each building in order to trend the results for many sites over several months.  
The data shows a minimum of 3 months in heating mode and 3 months in cooling mode.  PermaFrost® is 
applicable in both modes in heat pumps.  The data below will show a comparison of like months of the 
pre-treatment versus post-treatment billing cycles.

     Installation
Powertron Global™ sent a team of trained installers to work with the HVAC staff at Military Base A for the 
installation process.  Powertron Global™ personnel conducted a class room training session on the details 
of product handling, installation, expectations and handled all subsequent questions.  After conducting 
several unit installations Powertron Global™ staff monitored Military Base A HVAC staff complete the remainder 
of the facilities.

Summary
The pilot was successful and the units at the sites performed exactly as expected.  Total energy consumption 
for the sites was reduced 11.1% prior to weather adjustments and 12.5% after a slight adjustment for 
changes in weather.  The performance measured is projected to provide an initial payback of approximately 
9 to 11 months.  The climate in the Washington DC area is perfect for heat pumps and provides the 
opportunity to get savings for most of the year since the units operate in both seasons.  If these results are 
used to project the payback in standard HVAC systems operating only in cooling mode in this area, they 
would provide a payback of 12-14 months as a result of 3 months less operation time.
