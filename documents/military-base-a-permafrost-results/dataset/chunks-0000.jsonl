The decision was made to pick facilities that had  \nheat pumps and get performance data in the heating mode and the cooling mode.  The goal was to examine \npre & post kWh consumption for each building in order to trend the results for many sites over several months.  \nThe data shows a minimum of 3 months in heating mode and 3 months in cooling mode.  PermaFrost® is \napplicable in both modes in heat pumps.  The data below will show a comparison of like months of the \npre-treatment versus post-treatment billing cycles.\n1\nBldg 3766\n     kWh Used\n     Installation\nPowertron Global™ sent a team of trained installers to work with the HVAC staff at Military Base A for the \ninstallation process.

After conducting \nseveral unit installations Powertron Global™ staff monitored Military Base A HVAC staff complete the remainder \nof the facilities.  \nNovember \nDecember \nJanuary\nMarch\nApril \nMay\n17978\n20007\n22075\n20243\n16947\n12272\n15624\n25536\n12869\n36304\n12936\n10771\nBefore\nAfter\nAverage\nkWh reduction\nAdjusted\nfor weather\n-12.6%\n-13.1%\n\n\n\n2\n     kWh Used\nBldg 3765\nNovember \nDecember \nJanuary\nMarch\nApril \nMay\n**THE CEM THREW THIS BUILDING OUT **\n7519\n9516\n7660\n7873\n9009\n8463\n6159\n6257\n7771\n10381\n8965\nBefore\nAfter\nAverage\nkWh reduction\nAdjusted\nfor weather\nplus 2.0%\nplus 4.5%\nBldg 3616\nNovember \nDecember \nJanuary\nMarch\nApril \nMay\n9787\n8771\n10020\n9997\n10758\n10971\n9999\n9235\n9108\n8567\n9717\n9414\nBefore\nAfter\nAverage\nkWh reduction\nAdjusted\nfor weather\n-6.6%\n-8.3%\nPermaFrost® Results\nBldg 1845\nNovember \nDecember \nJanuary\nMarch\nApril \nMay\n25775\n25690\n27666\n23820\n23353\n24884\n20531\n23110\n24239\n23363\n23700\n25354\nBefore\nAfter\nAverage\nkWh reduction\nAdjusted\nfor weather\n-6.9%\n-6.3%\n\n\n\nTotal AFTER Weather adjustment\n3\n     kWh Used - Results\nTotal reduction in kWh\n-8.5% with Bldg 3765 \n \n \n-11.1% with out Bldg 3765 \n-9.1% with Bldg 3765 \n \n \n \n \n-12.5% with out Bldg 3765 \nAbnormal Usage not related to PermaFrost® \n \n \nPreviously calculated by [Energy Manager] CEM   \n \nEliminated by CEM for erratic meter patterns  \n \nPermaFrost® Results\nBldg 1778\nNovember \nDecember \nJanuary\nMarch\nApril \nMay\n7182\n7443\n9295\n7736\n6231\n5551\n5597\n7852\n7208\n6111\n4880\n3983\nBefore\nAfter\nAverage\nkWh reduction\nAdjusted\nfor weather\n-18.3%\n-22.5%\n     kWh Used", "tokens": 810, "chars": 2627, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "dataroom_026_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:d3638c2b0c03a9990e0ca291247928895b8e61d8846b57f0c4707a29e5a5325e"}

Total energy consumption \nfor the sites was reduced 11.1% prior to weather adjustments and 12.5% after a slight adjustment for \nchanges in weather.  The performance measured is projected to provide an initial payback of approximately \n9 to 11 months.  The climate in the Washington DC area is perfect for heat pumps and provides the \nopportunity to get savings for most of the year since the units operate in both seasons.  If these results are \nused to project the payback in standard HVAC systems operating only in cooling mode in this area, they \nwould provide a payback of 12-14 months as a result of 3 months less operation time.\n4\nPermaFrost® Results\n\n\n\n5\n     Weather\nNovember\nHDD\nCDD\nTotal\n543\n0\n543\nDifference in Post\n30.8% less HDD\n376\n0\n376\n2008\n2009\nDecember\nHDD\nCDD\nTotal\n759\n0\n759\nDifference in Post\n10% more HDD\n835\n0\n835\nJanuary\nHDD\nCDD\nTotal\n1028\n0\n1028\nDifference in Post\n11.1% less HDD\n914\n0\n914\n2009\n2010\n2008\n2009\n2009\n2010\nFebruary\nHDD\nCDD\nTotal\n698\n0\n698\nDifference in Post\n22.8% more HDD\n857\n0\n857\nPermaFrost® Results\n\n\n\n6\nMarch\nHDD\nCDD\nTotal\n608\n0\n608\nDifference in Post\n31.1% less HDD\n419\n0\n419\n2009\n2010\n2009\n2010\n2009\n2010\n2009\n2010\n2009\n2010\nApril\nHDD\nCDD\nTotal\n270\n37\n307\nDifference in Post\n35.2% less HDD\n& CDD combined\n159\n40\n199\nMay\nHDD\nCDD\nTotal\n73\n93\n166\nDifference in Post\n55.4% more HDD \n& CDD combined\n57\n201\n258\nJune\nHDD\nCDD\nTotal\n4\n270\n274\nDifference in Post\n72.6% more HDD \n& CDD combined\n0\n473\n473\nJuly\nHDD\nCDD\nTotal\n0\n378\n378\nDifference in Post\n49.7% more CDD\n0\n566\n566\nPermaFrost® Results", "tokens": 654, "chars": 1892, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 7}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_026_chunk_0001", "next_id": "", "content_hash": "sha256:84baa64a963910bfdc94e52f8d15c891fd8066440fbadb29bafd80987b71b6bf"}
