PermaFrost® Results
      In order to analyze the benefits of PermaFrost®, Military Base A agreed to treat a number of 
buildings and monitor the effects over a 6 month period.  The decision was made to pick facilities that had  
heat pumps and get performance data in the heating mode and the cooling mode.  The goal was to examine 
pre & post kWh consumption for each building in order to trend the results for many sites over several months.  
The data shows a minimum of 3 months in heating mode and 3 months in cooling mode.  PermaFrost® is 
applicable in both modes in heat pumps.  The data below will show a comparison of like months of the 
pre-treatment versus post-treatment billing cycles.
