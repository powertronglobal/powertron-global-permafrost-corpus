     Summary
The pilot was successful and the units at the sites performed exactly as expected.  Total energy consumption 
for the sites was reduced 11.1% prior to weather adjustments and 12.5% after a slight adjustment for 
changes in weather.  The performance measured is projected to provide an initial payback of approximately 
9 to 11 months.  The climate in the Washington DC area is perfect for heat pumps and provides the 
opportunity to get savings for most of the year since the units operate in both seasons.  If these results are 
used to project the payback in standard HVAC systems operating only in cooling mode in this area, they 
would provide a payback of 12-14 months as a result of 3 months less operation time.
