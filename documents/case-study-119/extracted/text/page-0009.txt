Notes
This Pilot DXC provides cooling for the African Telecom Provider B
Telecom switching center on campus. It is 
estimated the DXC runs approximately 4,380 
hours annually prior to the PermaFrost NMR® 
ECM being installed.
Chiller Load in both the Baseline and Post was 100%. OAT was 3.34ºC cooler in the 
Post so the measured 31.3 amps were adjusted upward to account for that.
