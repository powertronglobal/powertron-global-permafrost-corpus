HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report
Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study
Thermal degradation is well documented by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air 
Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). It is a major cause of 
capacity loss in Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (HVACR) systems, preventing them 
from operating at the original design efficiency soon after initial installation in the field. 
The purpose of this study is to verify the effectiveness of the PermaFrost NMR® Energy Conservation Measure 
(ECM) in a water-cooled DX Chiller unit (pictured below) at the African Telecom Provider B switching center location and 
document the future avoided energy costs associated with the same.
