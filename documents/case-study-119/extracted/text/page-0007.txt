Recovered Wasted Energy with PermaFrost NMR®
The chart to the right illustrates the performance
 restoration PermaFrost NMR® created in the 
treated DXC. The average cost to operate this DXC
 before it was treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as
 calculated in kWE/kWR, was 0.43.
The specific cost to operate this DXC after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kWE/kWR, is currently 0.32.
The baseline kWE/kWR ratings measured in-situ were higher than average but still within the expected 
range when compared to the ASHRAE loss of performance efficiency and cost to operate estimations for six 
(6) year old equipment with this amount of annual operating hours. The post results are also in line with 
the average improvement savings shown over more than 125,000 installations globally.
