Return On Investment
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for he African Telecom Provider B DXC. 
 
Baseline Energy Consumption
Adjusted Baseline Capacity: 59.08 kWR
Adjusted kW Baseline: 0.43 kWE/kWR * 59.08 kWR = 25.4 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 25.4 kW * 4,380 Annual Operating Hrs = 111,252 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 111,252 kWh * R1.10 = R122,377
 
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: 0.32 kWE/kWR * 59.08 kWR = 18.91 kW
Annual kWh Post: 18.91 kW * 4,380 hours = 82,826 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 82,826 kWh * R1.10 = R91,109
 
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: R122,377 – R91,109 = R31,268
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: R31,268 / 12 = R2,606
 
Initial Payback Period
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot DXC: R38,000
Estimated Initial Payback Period on the DXC: R38,000 / R2,606 = 14.58 months
Total kWh saved by treating this DXC = 28,426 kWh
 
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period 
for African Telecom Provider B implementing PermaFrost NMR®, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true 
energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended 
in the Avoided Energy Reporting (Post) Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the 
systems was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage 
capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the 
PermaFrostNMR® was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the 
reduced number of hours the systems will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the 
systems to reach the internal building set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand 
loading.
