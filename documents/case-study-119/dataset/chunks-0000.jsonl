The detailed performance testing \n(outlined later in this report) was performed on the DXC before (baseline) and after (post) the installation of \nPermaFrost NMR®. \nThis testing determined the impact on three key elements relating to the original design specifications that \ngreatly affect the HVAC portion of the African Telecom Provider B power bill. They include:\n \n1. The cooling capacity the DXC is capable of producing after just six (6) years in service. \n \n2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling  the DXC is delivering as \n \n    reflected in the kWEnergy / kWRefrigeration measurement. \n \n3. The thermal dynamic ability of the equipment to still perform at or close to operational design.  \nMethodology\nThe measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the \nIPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework.\n \n[Facilities Manager] of African Telecom Provider B and [Director] of Greenwave Automation witnessed and verified the \nrecording of all of the pilot measurements while being observed by Powertron Global’s Director of \nEngineering, [Senior Energy Engineer].\n  \nThe baseline day chosen to test the DXC’s was an average day temperature and humidity-wise for the \nJohannesburg area in the winter which ensured repeatability of similar weather for the post testing \nmeasurements. The weather and facility conditions on both days provided an adequate heat load on the \nfacility to ensure the compressor in the system would remain fully loaded and running during the actual data \ncollection period. The boundary of the testing was the DXC and nothing else; therefore confidence in the \naccuracy of the performance calculations is very high.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 495, "chars": 2430, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_112_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_112_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:5f10bccc4b68a0bc365a75ff6fcadcaf8681befce0fd1b6ef255a68c393a625b"}

This same pilot DXC was determined to be performing at an \naverage of 70% of the original design efficiency in the baseline. The actual design rated tonnage of the DXC is \n67 kWR. In actuality, the DXC was only producing a total of 46.77 kWR of cooling at the start of the pilot. The \nmajority of this 30% efficiency loss is directly attributable to the thermal degradation of the heat exchange \nsurfaces over a short period of time. This is due in large part to thermal degradation which creates an insulating barrier \nto heat transfer on the tube walls (inside the tube on a direct expansion chiller and outside the tube on a \nflooded evaporator chiller).  \nAfter the ECM was installed, the average efficiency in the DXC increased to 93.85% of design specifications, \nequating to 59.08 kWR. The restoration of 12.31 kWR  represents a 26.3% increase in capacity.   \n \nCost to African Telecom Provider B to Operate the DXC Baseline vs Post\nThe degraded capacity described above prior to PermaFrost NMR® being implemented was costing African Telecom Provider B\nTelecom a similar amount in the way of wasted energy each hour the DXC was operating. The average cost to \noperate the pilot DXC as calculated in kWE/kWR was 0.43 in the Baseline. When new, the kWE/kWR rating for \nunits like these usually ranges from 0.32 – 0.35 kW/kWR when the proper sized ducting is used.\n \nThe restored average kW/kWR rating following the ECM is now 0.32. This represents a 25.6% reduction in \nenergy costs from the baseline for every ton of cooling produced. This will result in an initial payback period \n(IPP) to African Telecom Provider B of 1.22 years and an internal rate of Return (IRR) of 82.3%. Extrapolated out over just the \nnext five (5) years, this ECM project will net African Telecom Provider B a substantial ROI of 411% on their investment. These \naccumulated savings will greatly reduce the eventual CapEx costs to replace the DXC’s when they finally reach \nthe end of their useful life.   \n \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 653, "chars": 2675, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_112_chunk_0003", "next_id": "pdf_112_chunk_0005", "content_hash": "sha256:b4fe1318c50e4c15c5dc43ca4b5df34a00bbfd2fda49293dbaf83235cd7507e7"}

This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended \nin the Avoided Energy Reporting (Post) Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the \nsystems was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage \ncapacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the \nPermaFrostNMR® was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the \nreduced number of hours the systems will now operate due to the restored capacity.
