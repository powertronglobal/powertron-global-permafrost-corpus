HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report
Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study
Thermal degradation is well documented by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air 
Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). It is a major cause of 
capacity loss in Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (HVACR) systems, preventing them 
from operating at the original design efficiency soon after initial installation in the field. 
The purpose of this study is to verify the effectiveness of the PermaFrost NMR® Energy Conservation Measure 
(ECM) in a water-cooled DX Chiller unit (pictured below) at the African Telecom Provider B switching center location and 
document the future avoided energy costs associated with the same.

Process
This comprehensive report contains specific information regarding the performance profile of a single 
water-cooled DX chiller (DXC) that supports the African Telecom Provider B facility. The detailed performance testing 
(outlined later in this report) was performed on the DXC before (baseline) and after (post) the installation of 
PermaFrost NMR®. 
This testing determined the impact on three key elements relating to the original design specifications that 
greatly affect the HVAC portion of the African Telecom Provider B power bill. They include:
 
1. The cooling capacity the DXC is capable of producing after just six (6) years in service. 
 
2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling  the DXC is delivering as 
 
    reflected in the kWEnergy / kWRefrigeration measurement. 
 
3. The thermal dynamic ability of the equipment to still perform at or close to operational design.  
Methodology
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the 
IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework.
 
[Facilities Manager] of African Telecom Provider B and [Director] of Greenwave Automation witnessed and verified the 
recording of all of the pilot measurements while being observed by Powertron Global’s Director of 
Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer].
  
The baseline day chosen to test the DXC’s was an average day temperature and humidity-wise for the 
Johannesburg area in the winter which ensured repeatability of similar weather for the post testing 
measurements. The weather and facility conditions on both days provided an adequate heat load on the 
facility to ensure the compressor in the system would remain fully loaded and running during the actual data 
collection period. The boundary of the testing was the DXC and nothing else; therefore confidence in the 
accuracy of the performance calculations is very high.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content detailed in this report will demonstrate the ability of the pilot DXC to perform prior to the ECM 
being installed, as well as illustrate the amount of thermal degradation 
within the heat exchangers. 
Following a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to determine the operational condition of the 
system was satisfactory, Baseline Measurement and Verification (M&V) data was collected and recorded by 
the M&V team. Approximately two (2) months after installation of PermaFrost NMR®, the M&V team 
returned on a very similar weather day to the Baseline to take Post M&V measurements in the identical 
fashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements and associated calculations show the amount of 
capacity restored.
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
• kWE = Volts * Amps * Power Factor *  √3 / 1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• kWR = (Airflow * 1 * Enthalpy Delta) * 4.185 
 
• kWE /kWR = Actual Cooling Capacity
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = 1 / Actual Cooling Capacity

HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Calculated Eﬃciency of African Telecom Provider B DXC Baseline and Post
The measurements taken show just how far off design the African Telecom Provider B pilot DXC had already degraded in 
terms of efficiency over six (6) years of use. This same pilot DXC was determined to be performing at an 
average of 70% of the original design efficiency in the baseline. The actual design rated tonnage of the DXC is 
67 kWR. In actuality, the DXC was only producing a total of 46.77 kWR of cooling at the start of the pilot. The 
majority of this 30% efficiency loss is directly attributable to the thermal degradation of the heat exchange 
surfaces over a short period of time. This is due in large part to thermal degradation which creates an insulating barrier 
to heat transfer on the tube walls (inside the tube on a direct expansion chiller and outside the tube on a 
flooded evaporator chiller).  
After the ECM was installed, the average efficiency in the DXC increased to 93.85% of design specifications, 
equating to 59.08 kWR. The restoration of 12.31 kWR  represents a 26.3% increase in capacity.   
 
Cost to African Telecom Provider B to Operate the DXC Baseline vs Post
The degraded capacity described above prior to PermaFrost NMR® being implemented was costing African Telecom Provider B
Telecom a similar amount in the way of wasted energy each hour the DXC was operating. The average cost to 
operate the pilot DXC as calculated in kWE/kWR was 0.43 in the Baseline. When new, the kWE/kWR rating for 
units like these usually ranges from 0.32 – 0.35 kW/kWR when the proper sized ducting is used.
 
The restored average kW/kWR rating following the ECM is now 0.32. This represents a 25.6% reduction in 
energy costs from the baseline for every ton of cooling produced. This will result in an initial payback period 
(IPP) to African Telecom Provider B of 1.22 years and an internal rate of Return (IRR) of 82.3%. Extrapolated out over just the 
next five (5) years, this ECM project will net African Telecom Provider B a substantial ROI of 411% on their investment. These 
accumulated savings will greatly reduce the eventual CapEx costs to replace the DXC’s when they finally reach 
the end of their useful life.

Recovered Wasted Energy with PermaFrost NMR®
The chart to the right illustrates the performance
 restoration PermaFrost NMR® created in the 
treated DXC. The average cost to operate this DXC
 before it was treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as
 calculated in kWE/kWR, was 0.43.
The specific cost to operate this DXC after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kWE/kWR, is currently 0.32.
The baseline kWE/kWR ratings measured in-situ were higher than average but still within the expected 
range when compared to the ASHRAE loss of performance efficiency and cost to operate estimations for six 
(6) year old equipment with this amount of annual operating hours. The post results are also in line with 
the average improvement savings shown over more than 125,000 installations globally.

Return On Investment
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for he African Telecom Provider B DXC. 
 
Baseline Energy Consumption
Adjusted Baseline Capacity: 59.08 kWR
Adjusted kW Baseline: 0.43 kWE/kWR * 59.08 kWR = 25.4 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 25.4 kW * 4,380 Annual Operating Hrs = 111,252 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 111,252 kWh * R1.10 = R122,377
 
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: 0.32 kWE/kWR * 59.08 kWR = 18.91 kW
Annual kWh Post: 18.91 kW * 4,380 hours = 82,826 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 82,826 kWh * R1.10 = R91,109
 
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: R122,377 – R91,109 = R31,268
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: R31,268 / 12 = R2,606
 
Initial Payback Period
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot DXC: R38,000
Estimated Initial Payback Period on the DXC: R38,000 / R2,606 = 14.58 months
Total kWh saved by treating this DXC = 28,426 kWh
 
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period 
for African Telecom Provider B implementing PermaFrost NMR®, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true 
energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended 
in the Avoided Energy Reporting (Post) Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the 
systems was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage 
capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the 
PermaFrostNMR® was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the 
reduced number of hours the systems will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the 
systems to reach the internal building set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand 
loading.

Notes
This Pilot DXC provides cooling for the African Telecom Provider B
Telecom switching center on campus. It is 
estimated the DXC runs approximately 4,380 
hours annually prior to the PermaFrost NMR® 
ECM being installed.
Chiller Load in both the Baseline and Post was 100%. OAT was 3.34ºC cooler in the 
Post so the measured 31.3 amps were adjusted upward to account for that.

The African Telecom Provider B is Saving More than just Energy
By treating the DXC with PermaFrost NMR® and based on the current manner in which they currently 
operate the unit, African Telecom Provider B will save approximately 28,426 kWh per year and all the costs associated with 
those savings. From an environmental impact standpoint, African Telecom Provider B is also benefitting the surrounding 
community. Imagine how great the environmental impact will be when African Telecom Provider Bmoves forward with treating 
all their HVAC equipment across South Africa.
The 28,426 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 19.6 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from 
being released or any of the following:
