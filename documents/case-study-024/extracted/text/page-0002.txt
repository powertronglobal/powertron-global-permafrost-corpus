Executive Summary 
 
A confirmatory test was conducted on eight (8) rooftop package air conditioning 
units (RTUs) located in the San Antonio Texas area at four (4) locations. Overall 
the efficiency improvements achieved were recorded at a 17.2% thermal capacity 
improvement and 25.7% reduction in kWh usage.  Prior to the implementation of 
the PermaFrost NMR nanotech solution, the units were operating at an average 
consumption rate of 1.37 kW per ton. After treatment the average kW/ton ratings is 
1.15 kW per ton however not all units or circuits have fully gestated and expect 
those numbers to further improve once that occurs. These thermal efficiency 
improvements have revealed the reduction in kWh savings by utilizing Cooling 
Degree-Days (CDD) comparisons (287 CDDs baseline vs. 287 CDDs post). A total 
of 2,140,762 data samples were utilized to comprise this report. Details can be 
found below and in the appendix sections of applicable units.
