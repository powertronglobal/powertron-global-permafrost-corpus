Dwyer O-4 (Outdoor and Ambient Air Temp) -Thermistor temperature sensor +-.22 
Thermistor temperature sensor: ±0.22°C @ 25°C (±0.4°F @ 77°F); RTD 
temperature sensor: DIN class B: ±0.3°C @ 0°C (±0.54°F @ 32°F). 
 
Dwyer AC Current Switches CCS-231150 (Compressor on/off) - Current switch, 
split core, adjustable set point with min. set point 1.5, normally open output. 0-200 
A AC. 0.3 A @ 135 VAC/DC; For non-dry contact models: 1 A @ 240 VAC. 
 
Dwyer AVUL (Air Velocity) - Simultaneous current and voltage outputs on all 
models provide universal inputs to monitoring equipment while the output range, 
units, and 0 to 5/10 VDC, 4-20 mA output. ±(5% of reading + 0.2 m/s) or ±(3% of 
reading + 0.2 m/s)  
 
Dwyer RHP-2D1B (Return and Supply RH and Temp) - Duct mount 2%  
 
RH/temperature transmitter with 4-20 mA RH output and 10K @ 25°C 
thermistor temperature output.  
 
FMV Platform & F2 Device – Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT) platform and edge 
device developed by Powertron Global that records sensor data through Modbus 
machine-to-machine language and transmit to the Cloud. Once in the Cloud the 
data is calculated utilizing standards engineering calculations as a basis of 
performance before and after the ECM treatment.  
 
 
Conclusion 
National Convenience Store Chain’s DX units’ compliant testing results validate the performance 
improvements of the treated HVAC/R system and are in line with a previously 
tested UL (Underwriters Laboratories) unit as well as +300 P.E. reviewed case 
studies available upon request. The results of the confirmatory testing 
demonstrate the efficacy of PermaFrost NMR® by restoring the evaporator and 
condenser heat transfer capabilities at or near manufacturer’s design, thereby 
restoring cooling capacity while lowering the electrical cost per ton of cooling.
