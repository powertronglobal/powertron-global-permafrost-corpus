The outdoor air temperature entering the air-cooled condenser coils of each unit 
will affect capacity and efficiency. An analysis is provided of the fourteen (14) day 
period of performance profiles including kW/ton, EER and COP across a variation 
of outdoor air temperatures spanning a thirty-degree (30) span (75ºF-105ºF).  
 
Total BTUH was developed along with total kW consumption by measuring all 
required data points (30 points - see appendix for points measured) and entering 
them into industry best practice engineering formulae.  
 
All measurement hardware was calibrated under NIST or CE standards. 
Engineering formulae was developed by AHRI / ASHRAE (American Heating and 
Refrigeration Institute / American Society of Heating Refrigeration & Air 
Conditioning Engineers): 
 
 
 
Kilo-watt (kW) = Volts (V) x Amps (A) x Power Factor (PF) / 1000 
British Thermal Units (BTU) = CFM x 4.5 x Enthalpy Delta  
Capacity / Tons = BTU / 12,000 
Kilo-watt per Ton (kW/Ton) = kW Energy / Tons (capacity) 
Co-Efficient of Performance (COP) = 12/kW per ton/ 3.412 
Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) = BTU / Watts 
 
 
 
To Determine Capacity: 
 
The cubic feet per minute (CFM) and inlet dry bulb and wet bulb temperature are 
measured within the return air sector of the rooftop unit. The inlet and outlet 
enthalpy are subtracted from each other (shown in the formula below) resulting in 
enthalpy delta.  Other components of this formula complete the equation. The result 
yields the industry standard British Thermal Unit (BTU), which is used to calculate 
the unit’s capacity.
