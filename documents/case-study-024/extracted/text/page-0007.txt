The capacity formula is: 
 
 
CFM x 4.5 x Enthalpy ∆ = BTUs / 12,000 = Tons (capacity) 
 
 
CFM – Cubic Feet per Minute of Air Flow or Air Volume 
4.5 – Ratio of Standard Air (constant) 
Enthalpy ∆ - Enthalpy Delta of the Inlet – Outlet Enthalpy 
BTU – British Thermal Units  
12,000 – every 12,000 BTUs equals 1 Ton (constant) 
 
 
Example 
 
4000 (CFM) X 4.5 (Standard Air Ratio) X 8 (Enthalpy Delta) = 144,000 BTU, then 
divide by 12,000 = 12 tons 
 
 
 
To Determine Electrical Energy Consumption: 
 
Total electrical consumption is measured at the main source of electric service of 
each unit. This three-phase formula includes, voltage, amperage, phase and power 
factor. This is then divided by 1000 to obtain kilowatts. The electrical formula for  
 
 
kilowatt (kW) is: 
 
kW = V x A x 1.72 x PF / 1000 
 
V – Voltage 
A – Amperage 
PF – Power Factor 
1000 – constant  
 
 
Example 
 
480 (volts) X 45 (amps) X 1.72 (sq. root of 3) X 0.90 (power factor) / 1000 = 19.4 
kilowatts
