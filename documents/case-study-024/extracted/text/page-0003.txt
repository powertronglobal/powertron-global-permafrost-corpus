Introduction 
 
The official baseline data-gathering period was performed from August 15 – 
September 17, 2024 for all four sites to verify the current energy efficiency and 
performance of eight (8) RTUs using Powertron Global’s FMV platform in 
conjunction with its F2 devices utilizing the latest in Internet of Things (IoT) cloud-
based reporting. It was determined to shift the baseline ~14-day period to later 
portion of the baseline data capture period in order to have an enhanced 
representative expression of heat load conditions in the pre & post data sets.  
 
The installation of the PermaFrost NMR did not occur until September 18-19, 
2024. The treated units were then allowed to operate/run as normal until the 
required gestation (compressor runtime to achieve system circulation) was 
achieved. Due to the seasons changing by November 1st and operational behavior 
for some of the units, four of the eight units achieved enough runtime for product 
seating and two of the eight units achieved enough runtime on only one 
circuit/compressor. We expect full gestation at a later date on the remaining units.
