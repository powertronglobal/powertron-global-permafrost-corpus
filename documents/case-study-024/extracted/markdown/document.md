Executive Summary

A confirmatory test was conducted on eight (8) rooftop package air conditioning 
units (RTUs) located in the San Antonio Texas area at four (4) locations. Overall 
the efficiency improvements achieved were recorded at a 17.2% thermal capacity 
improvement and 25.7% reduction in kWh usage.  Prior to the implementation of 
the PermaFrost NMR nanotech solution, the units were operating at an average 
consumption rate of 1.37 kW per ton. After treatment the average kW/ton ratings is 
1.15 kW per ton however not all units or circuits have fully gestated and expect 
those numbers to further improve once that occurs. These thermal efficiency 
improvements have revealed the reduction in kWh savings by utilizing Cooling 
Degree-Days (CDD) comparisons (287 CDDs baseline vs. 287 CDDs post). A total 
of 2,140,762 data samples were utilized to comprise this report. Details can be 
found below and in the appendix sections of applicable units.

Introduction

The official baseline data-gathering period was performed from August 15 – 
September 17, 2024 for all four sites to verify the current energy efficiency and 
performance of eight (8) RTUs using Powertron Global’s FMV platform in 
conjunction with its F2 devices utilizing the latest in Internet of Things (IoT) cloud-
based reporting. It was determined to shift the baseline ~14-day period to later 
portion of the baseline data capture period in order to have an enhanced 
representative expression of heat load conditions in the pre & post data sets.  
 
The installation of the PermaFrost NMR did not occur until September 18-19, 
2024. The treated units were then allowed to operate/run as normal until the 
required gestation (compressor runtime to achieve system circulation) was 
achieved. Due to the seasons changing by November 1st and operational behavior 
for some of the units, four of the eight units achieved enough runtime for product 
seating and two of the eight units achieved enough runtime on only one 
circuit/compressor. We expect full gestation at a later date on the remaining units.

Project Description 
 
Compliant testing is designed to monitor the operation of any system, before and 
after installation of PermaFrost NMR® to verify the amount of thermal capacity 
restored and current kW/ton energy savings improvement. Monitoring isolates the 
entry and departure points of the medium being cooled and the electrical power 
being used. Thus, the overall cooling capacity results can be compared to the 
overall power required per unit of cooling kW/Ton (kilowatt-per-ton), EER (Energy 
Efficiency Ratio), COP (Co-Efficient of Performance). 
 
Notes: 
 
Unit/Node 507 located at CK01 (2704090) in New Braunfels has both 
compressors/circuits wired (“jumped”) in a way that typically calls for both 
compressors each time it is called upon therefore causing this unit to handle the 
building load quite the majority of the time (see 508 notes below).  
 
This units staged cooling (first and second stage cooling) cannot function as per 
the manufacturers as a result.   This condition drastically is reducing the life cycle 
of this unit. Powertron recommends having a technician review this condition.  
 
Unit/Node 508 located at CK01, (2704090) the adjacent unit to 507, only 
operates during extreme temperatures when temperatures of >100 F are present.  
An attempt was made to artificially make it run but was mostly unsuccessful 
within a report structure. This unit is of 2023 vintage and contains some energy 
efficient features not being utilized and could share the workload with 507. 
 
Unit/Node 509 located at CK02 (2704091) is not called upon very often therefore 
not obtaining the required gestation for the benefits of the product to take full 
effect. Those benefits will eventually be realized at a later date once the unit runs 
more. This will be likely when the warmer temps return in the spring. 
 
Unit/Node 510 (also located at CK02) only runs with one compressor quite the 
majority of the time therefore only obtaining the required gestation in only one 
circuit/compressor. Powertron expects this unit to reach its full potential (circuit 2 
improvements) once the warmer weather returns.

Unit/Node 512 located at CK03 (2704068) has not achieved quite enough 
gestation time on compressor/circuit 2 at this point however partial results are 
present. This unit also has airflow issues that were documented earlier last month 
in November contained within the progress report submitted to the client. Now 
the unit is not being called upon since early November. It has short cycled (very 
brief ~1 min cycle times) “on” only a handful of times with the transition into 
colder temperatures. Warmer temps will be needed for it to finish its gestation.  
 
Unit/Node 514 located at CK04 (2704076), compressor/circuit 2 needs a bit more 
on gestation time however results are presenting themselves but expect further 
improvements.  
 
 
 
ECM Description 
 
When PermaFrost NMR (interior coil surface treatment) is installed into a unit, a 
thermal molecular transformation develops. This transformation removes the 
residual insulation effects of the presence of lubricants within the heat exchangers 
(evaporator / condensers) of vapor compression refrigeration systems.  This 
enables the evaporator to completely dehumidify the air per the  
unit’s design specifications.  When more dehumidification is developed, the 
enthalpy delta performance and thermal capacity increases. 
 
 
PermaFrost NMR does not change any unit’s electrical component usage, such as 
fans and compressors. It simply restores the thermal energy movement between 
the refrigerant within any system and it ability to absorb heat energy as in the 
performance of evaporators and condensers.

Method of Procedure for testing:

The objective of measuring the overall cooling production of HVAC/R systems is 
realized by measuring the total energy consumed by the specific unit being 
tested and the total BTUH thermal production of the system then calculating 
these parameters to obtain current capacity, kW/ton, EER (energy efficient ratio) 
and COP (coefficient of performance).    
 
For these HVAC/R systems, parameters were measured continuously every 
second during all hours for a period of fourteen (14) days to develop a scientific 
baseline.

The outdoor air temperature entering the air-cooled condenser coils of each unit 
will affect capacity and efficiency. An analysis is provided of the fourteen (14) day 
period of performance profiles including kW/ton, EER and COP across a variation 
of outdoor air temperatures spanning a thirty-degree (30) span (75ºF-105ºF).  
 
Total BTUH was developed along with total kW consumption by measuring all 
required data points (30 points - see appendix for points measured) and entering 
them into industry best practice engineering formulae.  
 
All measurement hardware was calibrated under NIST or CE standards. 
Engineering formulae was developed by AHRI / ASHRAE (American Heating and 
Refrigeration Institute / American Society of Heating Refrigeration & Air 
Conditioning Engineers):

Kilo-watt (kW) = Volts (V) x Amps (A) x Power Factor (PF) / 1000

British Thermal Units (BTU) = CFM x 4.5 x Enthalpy Delta

Capacity / Tons = BTU / 12,000

Kilo-watt per Ton (kW/Ton) = kW Energy / Tons (capacity)

Co-Efficient of Performance (COP) = 12/kW per ton/ 3.412

Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) = BTU / Watts

To Determine Capacity:

The cubic feet per minute (CFM) and inlet dry bulb and wet bulb temperature are 
measured within the return air sector of the rooftop unit. The inlet and outlet 
enthalpy are subtracted from each other (shown in the formula below) resulting in 
enthalpy delta.  Other components of this formula complete the equation. The result 
yields the industry standard British Thermal Unit (BTU), which is used to calculate 
the unit’s capacity.

The capacity formula is:

CFM x 4.5 x Enthalpy ∆ = BTUs / 12,000 = Tons (capacity)

CFM – Cubic Feet per Minute of Air Flow or Air Volume 
4.5 – Ratio of Standard Air (constant) 
Enthalpy ∆ - Enthalpy Delta of the Inlet – Outlet Enthalpy 
BTU – British Thermal Units  
12,000 – every 12,000 BTUs equals 1 Ton (constant)

Example 
 
4000 (CFM) X 4.5 (Standard Air Ratio) X 8 (Enthalpy Delta) = 144,000 BTU, then 
divide by 12,000 = 12 tons

To Determine Electrical Energy Consumption:

Total electrical consumption is measured at the main source of electric service of 
each unit. This three-phase formula includes, voltage, amperage, phase and power 
factor. This is then divided by 1000 to obtain kilowatts. The electrical formula for  
 
 
kilowatt (kW) is:

kW = V x A x 1.72 x PF / 1000 
 
V – Voltage 
A – Amperage 
PF – Power Factor 
1000 – constant  
 
 
Example 
 
480 (volts) X 45 (amps) X 1.72 (sq. root of 3) X 0.90 (power factor) / 1000 = 19.4

kilowatts

To Determine Efficiency: 
 
Divide the measured kilowatts (kW) by the measured tons to obtain kW per ton. kW

per ton is the industry standard to determine system efficiency.

Example

19.4 kW / 12 tons = 1.62 kilowatts per ton

Conclusion

National Convenience Store Chain’s DX units’ compliant testing results validate the performance 
improvements of the treated HVAC/R system and are in line with a previously 
tested UL (Underwriters Laboratories) unit as well as +300 P.E. reviewed case 
studies available upon request. The results of the confirmatory testing 
demonstrate the efficacy of PermaFrost NMR® by restoring the evaporator and 
condenser heat transfer capabilities at or near manufacturer’s design, thereby 
restoring cooling capacity while lowering the electrical cost per ton of cooling.
