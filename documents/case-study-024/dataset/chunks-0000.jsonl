Overall \nthe efficiency improvements achieved were recorded at a 17.2% thermal capacity \nimprovement and 25.7% reduction in kWh usage.  Prior to the implementation of \nthe PermaFrost NMR nanotech solution, the units were operating at an average \nconsumption rate of 1.37 kW per ton. After treatment the average kW/ton ratings is \n1.15 kW per ton however not all units or circuits have fully gestated and expect \nthose numbers to further improve once that occurs. These thermal efficiency \nimprovements have revealed the reduction in kWh savings by utilizing Cooling \nDegree-Days (CDD) comparisons (287 CDDs baseline vs. 287 CDDs post).

It was determined to shift the baseline ~14-day period to later \nportion of the baseline data capture period in order to have an enhanced \nrepresentative expression of heat load conditions in the pre & post data sets.  \n \nThe installation of the PermaFrost NMR did not occur until September 18-19, \n2024. The treated units were then allowed to operate/run as normal until the \nrequired gestation (compressor runtime to achieve system circulation) was \nachieved. Due to the seasons changing by November 1st and operational behavior \nfor some of the units, four of the eight units achieved enough runtime for product \nseating and two of the eight units achieved enough runtime on only one \ncircuit/compressor. We expect full gestation at a later date on the remaining units. \nThe F2 monitored HVAC/R equipment information can be found below:  \n \n \nSite ID \nEquip \nID \nMake \n Model Number \nSerial Number \nType \nYear \nMfg. \nRefrig.    \nType \nNominal \nCapacity \nCK01 \n507 \nHVAC Equipment Manufacturer \nWSC120E3R0A0\nRM0A1 \n164914039L \nRTU \n2016 \nR410 \n10 \nCK01 \n508 \nCarrier \n50FCM12A2A5A\n0A0A0 \n0423P71958 \nRTU \n2023 \nR410 \n10 \nCK02 \n509 \nHVAC Equipment Manufacturer \nWSD150E3R0B0\nBM0C1A1 \n171911084D \nRTU \n2017 \nR410 \n12.5 \nCk02 \n510 \nHVAC Equipment Manufacturer \nWSC120E3R0A0\nSM0C1A1 \n170913357L \nRTU \n2017 \nR410 \n10 \nCK03 \n511 \nHVAC Equipment Manufacturer \nWSC120E3R0A0\nRM0A1 \n163312074L \nRTU \n2016 \nR410 \n10 \nCk03 \n512 \nHVAC Equipment Manufacturer \nWSC120E3R0A0\nRM0A1 \n166312078L \nRTU \n2016 \nR410 \n10 \nCK04 \n513 \nHVAC Equipment Manufacturer \nWSC120E3R0A0\nRM0A1 \n164111401L \nRTU \n2016 \nR410 \n10 \nCK04 \n514 \nHVAC Equipment Manufacturer \nWSC120E3R0A0\nRM0A1 \n164111409L \nRTU \n2016 \nR410 \n10 \n \n4 Sites: \n \nCK01 - 2704090 – 541 S HWY 46, New Braunfels, TX  \nCK02 - 2704091 – 9514 FM 78, Converse, TX \nCK03 - 2704068 – 8002 FM 78, Converse, TX \nCK04 - 2704076 – 5911 Gibbs Sprawl Rd., San Antonio, TX", "tokens": 859, "chars": 2835, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_006_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_006_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:a67bd28be543662333075f6c1d9d8aebbe1de02b579a61c1ee80bee97c950dff"}
