Though all of the HVAC and refrigeration units supporting the two Major Restaurant Chain Donuts \nlocations involved in the pilot were treated, detailed forensic performance testing (outlined later in this \nreport) was performed on 50% of the operating units at each location.  The three units tested were all Carrier \npackaged rooftop units using R22 refrigerant and totaling 13 tons (one 5-ton unit and two 4-ton units).  \nThese two particular franchise locations are part of a series of stores owned by Chandresh Patel in the \nDetroit metropolitan area.\n \nThe substantial improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at the units was solely \nattributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The units now provide cooler supply air with greater efficiency \ndue to the restoration of the heat transfer ability of the evaporator and condenser coils, both of which have a \ndirect correlation to an increase in the number of Btuh the machines are now capable of producing. \n \nTotal system efficiency across all three units improved by an average of 21.8%, while the EER across the \nunits rose by 25.9%. There was an overall increase in coil capacity of 28,260 Btuh, equating to the restoration \nof 2.36-tons of capacity or 18.1%.  There is also a reduction of 19.5% in both total power and watts per ton, \nwhich is another measurable way to view the thermodynamic enhancement of the PermaFrost NMR® \nECM.  Without any power company rebates factored in, the result of the average ECM improvements is an \nROI to Major Restaurant Chain Donuts of just 9.6 months based on the runtime information provided to the team by the \nstore owners.  The tables of data and financial calculations are available for review at the end of this report.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 626, "chars": 2842, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_044_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:5cc37f7d8558129f760d6827587331de4b58ba6ac60263acd28087296de15da2"}

A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any \ntype of system in which it is installed – DX (direct expansion air and chilled water systems), Chillers \n(screw, reciprocating, scroll and centrifugal), heat pumps, ice making equipment.  Specialized \napplications include computer room cooling and dehumidification systems, chiller plants (water and \nice production applications), domestic and industrial refrigeration (ammonia low and ultra low \ntemperature), air-cooled single application water chillers and split and package rooftop HVAC \nequipment.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity, and \nimproved refrigerant velocity – all of which allows a system to achieve set point temperatures in a more \nrapid fashion that reduces system loading and operating periods.  The indirect benefits resulting from \nthe enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW \nhours used, less amp draw at the compressor, less metallic wear and longer overall equipment life.\nEnergy Science Division\nOIL BUILD-UP\nOIL REMOVED\nBEFORE TREATMENT\nAFTER TREATMENT\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\nMeasurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol\nThe International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocols (IPMVP) are used to develop this \nreport. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and \nAir-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the \nIPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and \nproducts.\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize.  They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.  Option B is \ndefined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (Permafrost NMR®) as the single \nsource of measurement.  Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM \naffected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using \nmeasurements of proxies of energy use. \nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+ - Routine adjustments + - Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 809, "chars": 3940, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_044_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_044_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:8a941d3b5f93b36603f15868fb4e17d7284527675115721fc2628dafa33e3972"}
