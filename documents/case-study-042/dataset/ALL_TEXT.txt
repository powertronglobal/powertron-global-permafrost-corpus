Performance Report on PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Major Restaurant Chain’ Donuts - 2 locations
September 6, 2012
Executive Summary
        This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure (ECM) 
PermaFrost NMR®.  Though all of the HVAC and refrigeration units supporting the two Major Restaurant Chain Donuts 
locations involved in the pilot were treated, detailed forensic performance testing (outlined later in this 
report) was performed on 50% of the operating units at each location.  The three units tested were all Carrier 
packaged rooftop units using R22 refrigerant and totaling 13 tons (one 5-ton unit and two 4-ton units).  
These two particular franchise locations are part of a series of stores owned by Chandresh Patel in the 
Detroit metropolitan area.
 
The substantial improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at the units was solely 
attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The units now provide cooler supply air with greater efficiency 
due to the restoration of the heat transfer ability of the evaporator and condenser coils, both of which have a 
direct correlation to an increase in the number of Btuh the machines are now capable of producing. 
 
Total system efficiency across all three units improved by an average of 21.8%, while the EER across the 
units rose by 25.9%. There was an overall increase in coil capacity of 28,260 Btuh, equating to the restoration 
of 2.36-tons of capacity or 18.1%.  There is also a reduction of 19.5% in both total power and watts per ton, 
which is another measurable way to view the thermodynamic enhancement of the PermaFrost NMR® 
ECM.  Without any power company rebates factored in, the result of the average ECM improvements is an 
ROI to Major Restaurant Chain Donuts of just 9.6 months based on the runtime information provided to the team by the 
store owners.  The tables of data and financial calculations are available for review at the end of this report.

Product Brief
         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface science Energy Control Measure 
(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) technology as its core agent.  A sustainable, 
one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any 
type of system in which it is installed – DX (direct expansion air and chilled water systems), Chillers 
(screw, reciprocating, scroll and centrifugal), heat pumps, ice making equipment.  Specialized 
applications include computer room cooling and dehumidification systems, chiller plants (water and 
ice production applications), domestic and industrial refrigeration (ammonia low and ultra low 
temperature), air-cooled single application water chillers and split and package rooftop HVAC 
equipment.
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity, and 
improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allows a system to achieve set point temperatures in a more 
rapid fashion that reduces system loading and operating periods.  The indirect benefits resulting from 
the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW 
hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, less metallic wear and longer overall equipment life.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocols (IPMVP) are used to develop this 
report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and 
Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the 
IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and 
products.
There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize.  They 
are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.  Option B is 
defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (Permafrost NMR®) as the single 
source of measurement.  Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM 
affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term 
measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by 
short-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using 
measurements of proxies of energy use. 
The final computation follows the formula:
Energy Science Division
Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy
+ - Routine adjustments + - Non-Routine Adjustments

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces.
 
A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the unit’s operational 
conditions were satisfactory. Baseline measurements were recorded and then the proper amount and type of 
PermaFrost NMR® was injected.  The product was then allowed four (4) weeks to seat itself into the metal 
surfaces before post measurements were taken to establish the efficiency gains.
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP International Performance Measurement and 
Verification Protocol as the M&V plan.  The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global’s Senior 
Energy Engineer [Senior Energy Engineer] ME/CEM/CMC/CMVP.
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
kW = Volts * Amps * 1.47 (Power Factor .85 *1.732) - for 3-Phase  
 
Delta T = Return Air DB – Supply Air DB
 
Enthalpy = Return Air WB Deg. F and Supply Air WB Deg. F Converted to Enthalpy
 
Actual Btuh Capacity = Measured CFM X 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta (Baseline – Post) 
 
System Eﬃciency % = Actual Coil Capacity Btuh / Nominal Coil Capacity Btuh
 
EER = Btuh / Adjusted Watts

Energy Reporting Period (Post)
The identical IPMVP data recordings from the baseline (including insertion depths with probes) were 
recorded on 9/4/2012 using the same recently NIST calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. 
Given the 9% cooler outdoor temperature in the Post, the compressor Amps (70% of the total Amps) were 
adjusted upward by 9%.  This adjustment then permeates through to the Post Watts as well as the Watts per 
Ton.  The measurements are as follows:

Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to determine a very accurate ROI for 
Major Restaurant Chain Donuts for implementing this ECM:
Baseline kWh = (6009.5 CTW / 1,000) * 5,760 Annual Operating Hrs = 34,615 kWh
Baseline Cost To Run = 34,615 kWh * $.105 = $3,635
Regression Analysis is then used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Taylor Unit  
Adjusted Base Tonnage = 4.78 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted Total Watts = 1,448 WPT * 4.78 tons = 6,917 W
Adjusted Base kWh = (6,921 TW/1,000) * 5,760 Annual Operating Hrs = 39,865 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM = 39,865 kWh * $.105 = $4,186
Post ECM kWh = (5,995 NTW / 1,000) * 5,760 Annual Operating Hrs = 34,531 kWh
Cost to Run After ECM = 34,531 kWh * $.105 = $3,626
Cost Savings per Month = ($4,186 - $3,626) / 12 = $46.66
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed @ $625 / $46.66 = 13.4
 
ROI = 13.4 months
