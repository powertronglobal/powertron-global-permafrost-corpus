Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to determine a very accurate ROI for 
Major Restaurant Chain Donuts for implementing this ECM:
Baseline kWh = (4,358.9 CTW / 1,000) * 5,760 Annual Operating Hrs = 25,107 kWh
Baseline Cost To Run = 25,107 kWh * $.135 = $3,389
Regression Analysis is then used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Taylor Unit  
Adjusted Base Tonnage = 3.9 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted Total Watts = 1,271 WPT * 3.9 tons = 4,957 ATW
Adjusted Base kWh = (4,957 ATW/1,000) * 5,760 Annual Operating Hrs = 28,552 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM = 28,552 kWh * $.135 = $3,855
Post ECM kWh = (4,293 NTW / 1,000) * 5,760 Annual Operating Hrs = 24,728 kWh
Cost to Run After ECM = 24,728 kWh * $.135 = $3,338
Cost Savings per Month = ($3,855 - $3,338) / 12 = $43
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed @ $500 / $43 = 11.7
 
ROI = 11.7 months
