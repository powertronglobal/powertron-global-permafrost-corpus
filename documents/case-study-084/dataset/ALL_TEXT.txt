2.0 OBJECTIVE

The objectives of the study were to verify the benefits afforded users of the PermaFrost product in
an ice machine application, in terms of reduction in energy consumption and the reduction of the
bin fill time. These benefits, in this application, can be translated into direct cost savings in the

production of ice in the hospitality industry.

3.0 DESCRIPTION OF SAMPLE

PermaFrost is a refrigerant additive reported to enhance the heat transfer. The client has indicated
that the product works by removing heat from metal surfaces, accelerating refrigerant flow,
increasing thermo-conductivity and heat transfer throughout the equipment. The client has
indicated that its unique molecular composition “passivates” and stabilizes the metal components
throughout the system, allowing for the refrigerant to absorb and dissipate heat at an accelerated

rate. In sealed systems, a single application is intended to last the life of the compressor.

4.0 TEST PROCEDURES

4.1 The ice machine was allowed to stabilize for a minimum of 6 cycles to establish a baseline of
production time and energy consumption levels.

4.2. 1 oz of PermaFrost was added directly introduced into refrigerant lines of the ice machine

4.3 The water feed for the ice machine was standard tap water. The unit was operated under
standard room temperature and humidity conditions (73°F and ~50% humidity) during the
entire testing period.

4.4 The energy consumption and bin fill times and any additional observations were measured
and recorded before and after the addition of PermaFrost.

4.5 Testing continued for a maximum of 24 hours after the addition of PermaFrost to the ice

machine.

5.0 Results

Test details - An ice cuber model Manitowoc GROISOA was tested before and after the
introduction of 1 oz of PermaFrost. This machine continuously circulates water over a cooled ice
trough. When the ice reaches a certain adjustable point it completes a circuit that triggers the
reverse hot cycle that heats the ice trough. The ice slides off the trough and into the bin. By doing
so the ice actuates a baffle connected to a switch that signals the compressor to resume the
cooling cycle. For this test the ice production time was measured and it was triggered off this
switch. The energy consumption was monitored on the incoming power supply to the entire unit.
Both prior to and after the introduction of PermaFrost the ice bin was completely empty so that

the cycle times were run under the same conditions.

The ice cycle time decreased from 20 minutes to 13 minutes, with a portion (approximately 2
minutes) of this being attributed to a cooler bin due to ice presence. A 25% reduction in ice
production time was attributed directly to the additive itself. The energy consumption decreased

by approximately 6% after the addition of Permafrost.

6.0 Conclusion/Summary
Over the 24-hour testing period the results indicated a decrease in ice production cycle time with
a corresponding decrease in energy consumption when PermaFrost was added to the Manitowoc

GRO150A (cuber type ice machine).
