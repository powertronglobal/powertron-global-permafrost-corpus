2.0 OBJECTIVE

The objectives of the study were to verify the benefits afforded users of the PermaFrost product in
an ice machine application, in terms of reduction in energy consumption and the reduction of the
bin fill time. These benefits, in this application, can be translated into direct cost savings in the

production of ice in the hospitality industry.

3.0 DESCRIPTION OF SAMPLE

PermaFrost is a refrigerant additive reported to enhance the heat transfer. The client has indicated
that the product works by removing heat from metal surfaces, accelerating refrigerant flow,
increasing thermo-conductivity and heat transfer throughout the equipment. The client has
indicated that its unique molecular composition “passivates” and stabilizes the metal components
throughout the system, allowing for the refrigerant to absorb and dissipate heat at an accelerated

rate. In sealed systems, a single application is intended to last the life of the compressor.

4.0 TEST PROCEDURES

4.1 The ice machine was allowed to stabilize for a minimum of 6 cycles to establish a baseline of
production time and energy consumption levels.

4.2. 1 oz of PermaFrost was added directly introduced into refrigerant lines of the ice machine

4.3 The water feed for the ice machine was standard tap water. The unit was operated under
standard room temperature and humidity conditions (73°F and ~50% humidity) during the
entire testing period.

4.4 The energy consumption and bin fill times and any additional observations were measured
and recorded before and after the addition of PermaFrost.

4.5 Testing continued for a maximum of 24 hours after the addition of PermaFrost to the ice

machine.
