Test details - An ice cuber model Manitowoc GROISOA was tested before and after the
introduction of 1 oz of PermaFrost. This machine continuously circulates water over a cooled ice
trough. When the ice reaches a certain adjustable point it completes a circuit that triggers the
reverse hot cycle that heats the ice trough. The ice slides off the trough and into the bin. By doing
so the ice actuates a baffle connected to a switch that signals the compressor to resume the
cooling cycle. For this test the ice production time was measured and it was triggered off this
switch. The energy consumption was monitored on the incoming power supply to the entire unit.
Both prior to and after the introduction of PermaFrost the ice bin was completely empty so that

the cycle times were run under the same conditions.

The ice cycle time decreased from 20 minutes to 13 minutes, with a portion (approximately 2
minutes) of this being attributed to a cooler bin due to ice presence. A 25% reduction in ice
production time was attributed directly to the additive itself. The energy consumption decreased

by approximately 6% after the addition of Permafrost.

6.0 Conclusion/Summary
Over the 24-hour testing period the results indicated a decrease in ice production cycle time with
a corresponding decrease in energy consumption when PermaFrost was added to the Manitowoc

GRO150A (cuber type ice machine).
