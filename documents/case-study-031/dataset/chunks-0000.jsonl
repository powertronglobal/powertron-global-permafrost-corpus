Many industry leading \norganizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age. \nThermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVAC/R equipment that operates as a \nvapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well \ndocumented by the HVAC/R industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal \ndegradation prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times \nand additional kWh consumption.\nThe chillers in this study (pictured below) are representative of a great majority of the portfolio of equipment \noperated by Major Global Bank. If thermal degradation is present in this chiller it is present in the entire inventory of \nequipment. Energy waste can be calculated based on this equipment (portfolio representation) and then \naccurately extrapolated across the entire inventory of equipment.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 511, "chars": 2395, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_036_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:352a9b860ab97061fa1ee87bb65ffab1330fd7d634ccef8086415a602dc7b47e"}

The cooling capacity the chillers produce after 11.5 (on average) years in service, before and after\nthe administration of the ECM.\n2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the chillers can deliver as\nreflected in the kW/ton measurement, before and after the administration of the ECM.\n3. The thermal dynamic ability of the chillers to perform in relation to operational design, before and\nafter the administration of the ECM.\nMethodology\nThe measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the \nIPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted Frank Sherry \nOperations Manager with Commercial Real Estate Services/Major Global Bank Realty Services and Powertron Global’s Director of \nEngineering, [Senior Energy Engineer].  \nNotes\nThe equipment measured were two YS water-cooled chillers manufactured by York. The GPM through the evaporator, the \nincoming condenser water and the return chilled water in the baseline and post were matched closely so no adjustments \nwere made.\nThe boundary of the testing was the chiller and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance \ncalculations is very high.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 461, "chars": 2302, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_036_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_036_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:1929021aad7b12f7ec33edb57ddb2d14e5f0a7a7847862dbcb4ba79a01030dfd"}

The delta of \nthese measurements and associated calculations show the amount of capacity restored.\nThe following IPMVP data points were recorded on 22 September 2014 using a flow meter recently calibrated by NIST \n(National Institutes of Standards and Technology) to insure measurement accuracy. The remaining measurements were \ntaken directly from the chiller’s control panel. The chiller was then treated with PermaFrost NMR® on the same day and \nallowed to run normally until 7 May 2015 to ensure the patented surface science nanotechnology had ample time to seat \ninto all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All measurements were taken at similar incoming water temperatures. \nThe collection of data, in both the baseline and post periods, was witnessed by [Witnesses] of \nCommercial Real Estate Services. \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 561, "chars": 2486, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_036_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_036_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:212a7686f98fbb140c8862be50fa7434bef289947c487a47e7c151ab9de72b8c"}

This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in \nthe Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller was when operating at the original \nenergy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to \nrun the chiller at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® ECM was installed. This regression analysis is \nthe most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours or load the chiller will now operate due to \nthe restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the chiller to reach the internal building set points with increased \nefficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.\n5\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 644, "chars": 2635, "pages": {"start": 5, "end": 6}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_036_chunk_0004", "next_id": "pdf_036_chunk_0006", "content_hash": "sha256:c1be1afa2a781d293cc1846bb882f6dcc8cd630b6aa60cb8e02d12cedca61d3c"}
