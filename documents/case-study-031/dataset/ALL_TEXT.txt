HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report
Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study
The purpose of this study is to verify the industry wide problem of efficiency loss in HVAC/R as projected by 
ASHRAE research and to quantify the amount of money wasted due to this loss. Many industry leading 
organizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age. 
Thermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVAC/R equipment that operates as a 
vapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well 
documented by the HVAC/R industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal 
degradation prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times 
and additional kWh consumption.
The chillers in this study (pictured below) are representative of a great majority of the portfolio of equipment 
operated by Major Global Bank. If thermal degradation is present in this chiller it is present in the entire inventory of 
equipment. Energy waste can be calculated based on this equipment (portfolio representation) and then 
accurately extrapolated across the entire inventory of equipment.

Process
This report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of two chillers that support 
the Major Global Bank Data Center in [Northeast Location], NJ. 
Detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the chillers before and after the 
installation of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM to determine the impact on the three key elements that greatly 
affect the HVAC/R power bill as they relate to the original design specifications:
1. The cooling capacity the chillers produce after 11.5 (on average) years in service, before and after
the administration of the ECM.
2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the chillers can deliver as
reflected in the kW/ton measurement, before and after the administration of the ECM.
3. The thermal dynamic ability of the chillers to perform in relation to operational design, before and
after the administration of the ECM.
Methodology
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the 
IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted Frank Sherry 
Operations Manager with Commercial Real Estate Services/Major Global Bank Realty Services and Powertron Global’s Director of 
Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer].  
Notes
The equipment measured were two YS water-cooled chillers manufactured by York. The GPM through the evaporator, the 
incoming condenser water and the return chilled water in the baseline and post were matched closely so no adjustments 
were made.
The boundary of the testing was the chiller and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance 
calculations is very high.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the chillers to perform prior to the 
PermaFrost NMR® ECM being installed, as well as illustrate the amount of thermal degradation due in large 
part to thermal degradation within the heat exchangers.
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase)
• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU
Notes
Following a diagnostic examination to determine the operational condition of the chiller was satisfactory, Baseline M&V 
data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. 400+ runtime hours after installation of the PermaFrost NMR® 
ECM, the M&V team returned to take Post M&V measurements in the identical fashion as in the Baseline. The delta of 
these measurements and associated calculations show the amount of capacity restored.
The following IPMVP data points were recorded on 22 September 2014 using a flow meter recently calibrated by NIST 
(National Institutes of Standards and Technology) to insure measurement accuracy. The remaining measurements were 
taken directly from the chiller’s control panel. The chiller was then treated with PermaFrost NMR® on the same day and 
allowed to run normally until 7 May 2015 to ensure the patented surface science nanotechnology had ample time to seat 
into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All measurements were taken at similar incoming water temperatures. 
The collection of data, in both the baseline and post periods, was witnessed by [Witnesses] of 
Commercial Real Estate Services.

Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the Major Global Bank Data Center Chillers 3 & 4.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 639 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline:  .635 kW/ton * 648 tons = 411.48 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 411.48 kW * 5650 Annual Operating Hrs = 2,324,862 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 2,324,862 kWh * $.11 = $255,734
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: .595 kW/ton * 648 tons = 385.56 kW
Annual kWh Post: 385.56 kW * 5650 hours = 2,178,414 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 2,178,414 kWh * .11 cents = $239,626
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $255,734 - $239,626 = $16,108
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $16,108 / 12 = $1,342
Initial Payback Period
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the chillers (3 & 4): $13,708
Estimated ROI Period for Major Global Bank on the chillers: $13,708 / $1,342 = 10.2 months
Annual Rate of Return = 117.5%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 587.5%
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for 
Major Global Bank for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true 
energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in 
the Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller was when operating at the original 
energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to 
run the chiller at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® ECM was installed. This regression analysis is 
the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours or load the chiller will now operate due to 
the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the chiller to reach the internal building set points with increased 
efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.

Major Global Bank/Property Management Firm is Saving More
than Just Energy
By treating the chillers with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the current manner in which Major Global Bank/Commercial Real Estate Services operates the chillers, it will save approximately 146,448 kWh per year and all the costs 
associated with those savings. From an environmental impact standpoint, Major Global Bank/Commercial Real Estate Services 
is also benefitting the surrounding community of [Northeast Location], NJ. Imagine how great the environmental 
impact will be when Major Global Bank moves forward with treating all their chiller equipment in all their properties 
across their portfolio.
The 146,448 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 101 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from 
being released or any of the following:
Annual greenhouse emissions from:
CO2 emissions from:
.541
