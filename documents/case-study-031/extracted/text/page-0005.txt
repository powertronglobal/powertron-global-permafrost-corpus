Recovered Wasted Energy with ECM - Chiller #3
The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration the ECM created in the treated chiller. The 
average cost to operate this chiller before it was treated 
with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in kW/ton, was 
.651.
The specific cost to operate this chiller after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, is currently .624.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ 
was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate for 
11.5 year-old year old chillers utilizing R-22 refrigerant.
