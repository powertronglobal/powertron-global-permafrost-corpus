by an HVAC/R system can be realized by measuring voltage, amperage and 
power factor.  
For these specific HVAC systems many parameters were measured every two 
seconds for a period of eight (8) days for the development of a scientific baseline 
of performance and a post period of eight (8) days for the development of a 
scientific post analysis of performance. Data was extracted from the parameters 
measured every five (5) seconds during the normal operating hours of 8am to 
11pm.  
Total BTUH was developed along with total kW consumption by measuring all 
required data points (35 points see appendix for points measured) and entering 
them into industry best practice engineering formulae. All measurement hardware 
was certified under NIST or CE standards. Engineering formulae was developed 
by AHRI / ASHRAE (American Heating and Refrigeration Institute / American 
Society of Heating Refrigeration & Air Conditioning Engineers) 
During regular business hours the outdoor air temperature entering the air-cooled 
condenser coils of each unit will affect the design capacity. Therefore we have 
provided baseline and post analysis of the eight (8) day periods at several 
outdoor air temperature intervals so as to provide the comparison of improved 
capacity and subsequent kW per ton, EER and COP across a variation of 
outdoor air temperatures consisting of a twelve (12) degree span (74-85 degrees 
F) to demonstrate the improvements across the temperature span.

CONCLUSION 
The results of the testing validate the performance improvement and are 
consistent with the UL (Underwriters Laboratories) results of PermaFrost NMR 
and the 300+ case studies available for review.
