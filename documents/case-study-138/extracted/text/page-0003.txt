GENERAL FINDINGS 
1.
Pre Inspection
Before testing began our engineering team arrived on site to perform a pre-test 
performance exercise. 
DHU 9 was observed as having low capacity production and high kW/ton due to 
the following: 
1) Low CFM due to glazed evaporator blower fan motor, loose evaporator blower
fan belt. 
2) ERV not operating
Powertron Global notified client and this action concluded with a service 
work order was sent to customer’s service contractor. Repairs were 
concluded and system was determined to be ready for the test. 
DHU 16 was observed as having low capacity production and high kW/ton due to 
the following: 
1) Low CFM due to the loose evaporator blower fan belt and damaged blower
motor sheave
2) 2) ERV not operating 
3) 3) Problematic sub-cooling and superheat 
Powertron Global notified client and this action concluded with a service 
work order was sent to customer’s service contractor.

Equipment Selection
DHU 9 was selected as the test candidate because it was the most conservative 
choice for performance improvement and was the best representation of 
customer’s HVAC/R portfolio of equipment.

Method of Procedure for testing:
The objective of measuring the overall cooling production of HVAC/R systems 
can be realized by measuring the total energy consumed by the specific unit 
being tested and the total BTU production of the system then calculating these 
parameters to obtain kW per ton, EER (energy efficient ratio) and COP 
(coefficient of performance). Using that information the total BTUH of cooling 
production can be realized. The objective of measuring overall power consumed
