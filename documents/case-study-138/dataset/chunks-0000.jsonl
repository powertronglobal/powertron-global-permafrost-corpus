Unit #16 (control) was also \nmonitored using the same methodology to measure its current kW/ton efficiency \nwithout PermaFrost NMR during the same time duration. \nThe monitoring isolates the entry and departure points of the medium being \ncooled and the power being used. By recording the conditions at those entry and \ndeparture points the overall cooling results can be compared to the overall power \nconsumed to quantify the power costs per unit of cooling kW/Ton (kilowatt-per-\nton), EER (Energy Efficiency Ratio) & COP (Co-Efficient of Performance). \nB. \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \nThe average efficiency improvements per system are: \nTESTED \nUNIT #9 \nkW/Ton \nCapacity-\nTons \nCOP \nEER \nEnthalpy \nBaseline \n0.99 \n22.2 \n3.61 \n12.31 \n5.53 \nPost \n0.81 \n25.7 \n4.4 \n15 \n6.39 \nImprovement % \n18.2% \n15.8% \n21.9% \n21.9% \n15.6% \nCONTROL \nUNIT #16 \nkW/Ton \nCapacity-\nTons \nCOP \nEER \nEnthalpy \nFeb 6-13 \n1.43 \n14.1 \n2.47 \n8.41 \n3.39 \nMar 7-14 \n*1.55\n13.1 \n2.28 \n7.77 \n3.14 \n* as expected per more samples in warmer weather\n\n\u2550\u2550\u2550 PAGE 003 \u2550\u2550\u2550\n3 \nC. \nGENERAL FINDINGS \n1.\nPre Inspection\nBefore testing began our engineering team arrived on site to perform a pre-test \nperformance exercise. \nDHU 9 was observed as having low capacity production and high kW/ton due to \nthe following: \n1) Low CFM due to glazed evaporator blower fan motor, loose evaporator blower\nfan belt. \n2) ERV not operating\nPowertron Global notified client and this action concluded with a service \nwork order was sent to customer\u2019s service contractor.

The objective of measuring overall power consumed \n\n\u2550\u2550\u2550 PAGE 004 \u2550\u2550\u2550\n4 \nby an HVAC/R system can be realized by measuring voltage, amperage and \npower factor.  \nFor these specific HVAC systems many parameters were measured every two \nseconds for a period of eight (8) days for the development of a scientific baseline \nof performance and a post period of eight (8) days for the development of a \nscientific post analysis of performance. Data was extracted from the parameters \nmeasured every five (5) seconds during the normal operating hours of 8am to \n11pm.  \nTotal BTUH was developed along with total kW consumption by measuring all \nrequired data points (35 points see appendix for points measured) and entering \nthem into industry best practice engineering formulae. All measurement hardware \nwas certified under NIST or CE standards. Engineering formulae was developed \nby AHRI / ASHRAE (American Heating and Refrigeration Institute / American \nSociety of Heating Refrigeration & Air Conditioning Engineers) \nDuring regular business hours the outdoor air temperature entering the air-cooled \ncondenser coils of each unit will affect the design capacity. Therefore we have \nprovided baseline and post analysis of the eight (8) day periods at several \noutdoor air temperature intervals so as to provide the comparison of improved \ncapacity and subsequent kW per ton, EER and COP across a variation of \noutdoor air temperatures consisting of a twelve (12) degree span (74-85 degrees \nF) to demonstrate the improvements across the temperature span.\nD.  \nCONCLUSION \nThe results of the testing validate the performance improvement and are \nconsistent with the UL (Underwriters Laboratories) results of PermaFrost NMR \nand the 300+ case studies available for review. \n\n\u2550\u2550\u2550 PAGE 005 \u2550\u2550\u2550\n5 \nF. \nAPPENDIX \nI. \nUnit #9 (TESTED) Performance Analysis Summary \nII.\nUnit #16 (CONTROL) Performance Analysis Summary\nIII.\nPoints Measured\n*(all csv files are available) \n\n\u2550\u2550\u2550 PAGE 006 \u2550\u2550\u2550\n6 \nAPPENDIX I \n\n\u2550\u2550\u2550 PAGE 007 \u2550\u2550\u2550\nHVAC Performance Comparison: kW/Ton\n DHU 9 Kit 4 TESTED\nkW/Ton Comparison \nOSA Temp.\nBase kW/Ton\nPost kW/Ton\n74 degF\n1.22 kW/Ton\n1.04 kw/Ton\n75 degF\n1.06 kW/Ton\n0.79 kw/Ton\n76 degF\n1.05 kW/Ton\n0.84 kw/Ton\n77 degF\n0.92 kW/Ton\n0.81 kw/Ton\n78 degF\n0.88 kW/Ton\n0.76 kw/Ton\n79 degF\n0.91 kW/Ton\n0.77 kw/Ton\n80 degF\n0.95 kW/Ton\n0.72 kw/Ton\n81 degF\n0.91 kW/Ton\n0.75 kw/Ton\n82 degF\n0.91 kW/Ton\n0.78 kw/Ton\n83 degF\n0.96 kW/Ton\n0.88 kw/Ton\n84 degF\n0.89 kW/Ton\n0.76 kw/Ton\n85 degF\n1.17 kW/Ton\n0.79 kw/Ton\nReport Parameters \nOSA Range.\nRA Filter\nPF Filter\nSampling Rate\nTotal Base Samples\nTotal Post Samples\n74 degF - 85 degF\n68.0 degF - 72.0 degF\n0.5 - 1.0\n5s\n47362 samples\n45537 samples", "tokens": 1132, "chars": 4303, "content_hash": "f96738d33b71", "prev_id": "case-study-138_chunk_0001", "next_id": "case-study-138_chunk_0003"}
