Formula for adjusted post tonnage = 899 + 10% = 990 tons
Post kW calculated from the volts and amps, power factor and efficiency total 607.87. Reduce that by the 6% 
increase as a result of the added temperature of the condenser and you get = 607.87 - 6% = 571.4 kW
Formula for adjusted post kW per ton = 571.4 kW / 990 tons = 0.58 kW per ton
