Results
The following results are based off of the Baseline Measurement of data and the Energy Reporting Period.
kW per ton Baseline = .63254 kW/ton * 1007 tons = 636.9 kW
kW per ton Energy Reporting Period = .57717 kW/ton * 990 tons = 571.4 kW
Annual kWh Baseline 636.9 kW * 2,600 hours = 1,655,940 kWh
Annual Cost Baseline = 1,655,940* .12 cents = $198,712.80
Annual kWh Energy Reporting Period 571.4 kW * 2,600 hours = 1,485,640 kWh
Annual Cost Energy Reporting Period = 1,485,640 kWh * .12 cents = $178,276.80
Avoided Energy Cost (savings)= $20,436
$20,436 / 12 months = $1703 per month / Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed @ $19,548.70 = 11.47 months
 
ROI = 11.5 months
