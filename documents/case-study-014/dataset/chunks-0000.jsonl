When installed into the low side port, the product immediately goes to \nwork restoring optimal heat transfer characteristics to the coils by embedding into the microscopic lattice structure of the metal as a thermal transfer agent, forming a passive nano-magnetic film on the surface. This process enhances the conductivity of the metal and creates a permanent thermal coating that maintains optimal heat transfer efficiency for the life of the equipment. \nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity, and \nbetter refrigerant flow – all of which allows a system to achieve set temperatures quicker and then shut \noff, unload or throttle back. \nThe indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment \ninclude reduced run time, less kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, superior lubrication, \nless metallic wear and longer overall equipment life.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\nExecutive Summary\nThis report contains specific information regarding the installation of PermaFrost NMR® in a Carrier 19XR \nwater-cooled chiller owned by Pharma Company B located in New Brunswick, NJ.\nThe Pharma Company B facility contact that managed the pilot was Frank Bagelio. \nIn summary, The Company’s chiller treated with \nthe PermaFrost NMR® ECM showed an 4.6% \nreduction in kW; a 10.7% reduction in required \noperating tonnage to deliver set point; a 8.8% \nreduction in kW/ton; an 9.6% improvement in \nCOP; a 55.6% improvement in refrigerant \napproach.

The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and \nAir-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the \nIPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and \nproducts.\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize.  They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.\nRetrofit Isolation (Option B) is defined as: All parameter measurement with the boundary of the ECM \n(PermaFrost NMR®) as the single source of measurement.  Savings are determined by field measurement of \nthe energy use of the energy conservation method affected equipment or system and any performance \nenhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained.  The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using \nmeasurements of proxies of energy use.\nThe final computation follows the formula below:\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+ - Routine adjustments + - Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 471, "chars": 2327, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_020_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_020_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:56471fae89314e9bb374bf92612edd62a1aa5f0680c8942c3b413eb433b5f264"}

The improvement in the refrigerant approach, a measurable thermodynamic enhancement \nof PermaFrost NMR®, at 55.6%. These results are highly significant. This chiller not only provides chilled \nwater at the rated GPM and design chilled water outlet temperature at reduced kWh and cost, it also does \nthis at a greater tonnage per kW. This allows the chiller to produce more tonnage at less energy. \nThe introduction of PermaFrost NMR® has restored a significant amount of chilled water performance to \nsupport this facility, which has resulted in much lower operational costs.\nBased on the data collected, the return on investment (ROI) for this ECM is just 11.5 months.\nA regression analysis was required to compensate for the increase in the incoming condenser water \ntemperature. During the baseline the temperature was 74.1 deg. F. During the avoided energy reporting \nperiod or the post data period the entering condenser water was 78.8 deg. F. \nDuring baseline and the post periods the chiller was operating at full load and with the identical GPM \nacross the evaporator. There was a recorded increase of 6% in the kW category and a reduction of 10% in \ncapacity. An analysis was performed of the actual temperature increase in degrees F of the water and the \nreduction of capacity and the increase of energy. \nThe condenser water temperature increase is 6% and the energy increase is also 6%. The direct correlation of \nthe increase in energy is attributed to the increase in condenser operating temperatures. As a result the post \nenergy reporting data was adjusted for this predicted variable.\nThe increase in condenser water temp is also attributable to the reduction in capacity from the 1007 tons \nmeasured in the baseline when the entering condenser water was 4.8 degrees cooler. This decrease in \ncapacity is approximately 10% and resets the capacity in the post energy period to 989 tons as a result of the \nwarmer water in the condenser. This capacity was adjusted as a non routine variable.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\nEnergy Science Division\nFormula for adjusted post tonnage = 899 + 10% = 990 tons\nPost kW calculated from the volts and amps, power factor and efficiency total 607.87. Reduce that by the 6% \nincrease as a result of the added temperature of the condenser and you get = 607.87 - 6% = 571.4 kW\nFormula for adjusted post kW per ton = 571.4 kW / 990 tons = 0.58 kW per ton\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 816, "chars": 3614, "pages": {"start": 8, "end": 10}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_020_chunk_0004", "next_id": "", "content_hash": "sha256:19f7fd400aa334f57ba3ad55a7a595cdeadf6728dea296d135b024749278b172"}
