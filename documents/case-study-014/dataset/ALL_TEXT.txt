Energy Performance Report
Pharma Company B
August 6, 2012
Product Brief
        Our patented surface chemical nanotechnology is a sustainable one-time treatment that lasts for the 
remaining useful life of any type of system in which it’s installed – DX (RTUs, Split Systems, CRAC’s), 
Chillers (including Ammonia Chillers), Heat Pumps, Ice Machines, or Refrigerated Transport. 
PermaFrost NMR® is a Nanotechnology that uses the patented Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) 
technology as its core agent.  When installed into the low side port, the product immediately goes to 
work restoring optimal heat transfer characteristics to the coils by embedding into the microscopic lattice structure of the metal as a thermal transfer agent, forming a passive nano-magnetic film on the surface. This process enhances the conductivity of the metal and creates a permanent thermal coating that maintains optimal heat transfer efficiency for the life of the equipment. 
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity, and 
better refrigerant flow – all of which allows a system to achieve set temperatures quicker and then shut 
off, unload or throttle back. 
The indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment 
include reduced run time, less kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, superior lubrication, 
less metallic wear and longer overall equipment life.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol IPMVP
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) is used to develop this 
report.  The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and 
Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the 
IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and 
products.
There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize.  They 
are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.
Retrofit Isolation (Option B) is defined as: All parameter measurement with the boundary of the ECM 
(PermaFrost NMR®) as the single source of measurement.  Savings are determined by field measurement of 
the energy use of the energy conservation method affected equipment or system and any performance 
enhancements versus the baseline data.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term 
measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained.  The savings are calculated by 
short-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using 
measurements of proxies of energy use.
The final computation follows the formula below:
Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy
+ - Routine adjustments + - Non-Routine Adjustments

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content of the following report will demonstrate the effects of PermaFrost NMR®’s ability to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces. 
It was determined with Pharma Company B to treat 1 water-cooled chiller. A diagnostic examination of the 
pilot equipment is implemented to determine if the unit’s operational conditions are satisfactory. Baseline 
measurements will be recorded and then the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® will be injected. 
The product will be allowed 4 weeks to seat itself into the metal surfaces before post measurements were 
taken to establish the efficiency gains. 
The unit was fully loaded during the baseline and the in the Energy Reporting Periods. The following 
parameters during a five-minute period were recorded:
Chiller kW, Chilled Water Delta T, Condenser Water Delta T, Condensed Liquid Refrigerant Temperature, 
Saturated (Suction) Evaporator Refrigerant Temperature, Operating Tonnage, kW per Ton and COP.
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
•  To determine the kW, voltage, amperage and power factor were recorded using a digital kW meter. Data 
from that meter is automatically calculated. Those data streams were verified by the manual calculation for 
determining kW energy as:
 
Volts * Amps * .85 * 1.732 / 1000
•  To determine the actual GPM the following formula was utilized:
 
GPM2 = GPM * Measured Pressure Drop (ft) / by Design Pressure Drop (ft) (squared)
•  To determine the Actual Cooling Tons per Hour the following formula was utilized:
 
Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU
•  To determine the Operating kW per Ton the following formula was utilized:
 
Actual kW / Actual Tonnage

Conclusion
The improved efficiency (kW per ton) at the unit at full load was 8.8%; a 10.7% reduction in required 
operating tonnage to deliver set point; a 8.8% reduction in kW/ton; an 9.6% improvement in COP; 4.6% 
reduction in kW. The improvement in the refrigerant approach, a measurable thermodynamic enhancement 
of PermaFrost NMR®, at 55.6%. These results are highly significant. This chiller not only provides chilled 
water at the rated GPM and design chilled water outlet temperature at reduced kWh and cost, it also does 
this at a greater tonnage per kW. This allows the chiller to produce more tonnage at less energy. 
The introduction of PermaFrost NMR® has restored a significant amount of chilled water performance to 
support this facility, which has resulted in much lower operational costs.
Based on the data collected, the return on investment (ROI) for this ECM is just 11.5 months.
A regression analysis was required to compensate for the increase in the incoming condenser water 
temperature. During the baseline the temperature was 74.1 deg. F. During the avoided energy reporting 
period or the post data period the entering condenser water was 78.8 deg. F. 
During baseline and the post periods the chiller was operating at full load and with the identical GPM 
across the evaporator. There was a recorded increase of 6% in the kW category and a reduction of 10% in 
capacity. An analysis was performed of the actual temperature increase in degrees F of the water and the 
reduction of capacity and the increase of energy. 
The condenser water temperature increase is 6% and the energy increase is also 6%. The direct correlation of 
the increase in energy is attributed to the increase in condenser operating temperatures. As a result the post 
energy reporting data was adjusted for this predicted variable.
The increase in condenser water temp is also attributable to the reduction in capacity from the 1007 tons 
measured in the baseline when the entering condenser water was 4.8 degrees cooler. This decrease in 
capacity is approximately 10% and resets the capacity in the post energy period to 989 tons as a result of the 
warmer water in the condenser. This capacity was adjusted as a non routine variable.

Formula for adjusted post tonnage = 899 + 10% = 990 tons
Post kW calculated from the volts and amps, power factor and efficiency total 607.87. Reduce that by the 6% 
increase as a result of the added temperature of the condenser and you get = 607.87 - 6% = 571.4 kW
Formula for adjusted post kW per ton = 571.4 kW / 990 tons = 0.58 kW per ton
