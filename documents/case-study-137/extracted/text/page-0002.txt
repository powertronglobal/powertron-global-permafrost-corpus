A.
INTRODUCTION
From August 1, to September 3, 2016 at the New York Park, testing was 
implemented to verify energy reduction through the Powertron Global product 
PermaFrost NMR affecting the refrigerant circuits of two 15-Ton package DX 
units.
Unit #3 - Carrier 48HJM017- 72088, Mfg Date 2003, R-22 equipped
Unit #4 - Carrier 48HJM017- 72088, Mfg Date 2003, R-22 equipped
The testing was designed to monitor the operation of the systems before and 
after the installation of PermaFrost NMR and to verify the amount of capacity 
restoration and the resulted energy savings.
The monitoring isolates the entry and departure points of the medium being 
cooled and the power being used. By recording the conditions at those entry and 
departure points the overall cooling results can be compared to the overall power 
consumed to quantify the power costs per unit of cooling kW/Ton (kilowatt-per-
ton), EER (Energy Efficiency Ratio) & COP (Co-Efficient of Performance).
