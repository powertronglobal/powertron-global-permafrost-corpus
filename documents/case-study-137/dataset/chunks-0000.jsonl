By recording the conditions at those entry and \ndeparture points the overall cooling results can be compared to the overall power \nconsumed to quantify the power costs per unit of cooling kW/Ton (kilowatt-per-\nton), EER (Energy Efficiency Ratio) & COP (Co-Efficient of Performance).\nB.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe average efficiency improvements per system are:\nUNIT\t\n \u00a0#3\t\n \u00a0\nkW/Ton\t\n \u00a0\nCOP\t\n \u00a0\nEER\t\n \u00a0\nBaseline\t\n \u00a0\n1.49\t\n \u00a0\n2.42\t\n \u00a0\n8.27\t\n \u00a0\nPost\t\n \u00a0\n1.12\t\n \u00a0\n3.15\t\n \u00a0\n10.75\t\n \u00a0\nImprovement\t\n \u00a0%\t\n \u00a0\n24.8%\t\n \u00a0\n30.2%\t\n \u00a0\n30.0%\t\n \u00a0\nUNIT\t\n \u00a0#4\t\n \u00a0\nkW/Ton\t\n \u00a0\nCOP\t\n \u00a0\nEER\t\n \u00a0\nBaseline\t\n \u00a0\n1.85\t\n \u00a0\n1.93\t\n \u00a0\n6.60\t\n \u00a0\nPost\t\n \u00a0\n0.71\t\n \u00a0\n5.04\t\n \u00a0\n17.18\t\n \u00a0\nImprovement\t\n \u00a0%\t\n \u00a0\n61.6%\t\n \u00a0\n161.1%\t\n \u00a0\n160.3%\t\n \u00a0\n\n\u2550\u2550\u2550 PAGE 003 \u2550\u2550\u2550\n \n \nC. \nGENERAL FINDINGS \n \n1.

The objective of measuring overall power consumed \nby an HVAC system can be realized by measuring voltage, amperage and power \nfactor.  \n \nFor these specific HVAC systems many parameters were measured every two \nseconds for a period of seven (7) days for the development of a scientific \nbaseline of performance and a post period of seven (7) days for the development \nof a scientific post analysis of performance.

Running the compressor(s) less significantly reduces energy \nconsumption. In this case Unit #3 and #4 had significantly less runtime hours with \nmatching weather data.
