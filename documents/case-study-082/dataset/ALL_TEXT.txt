PermaFrost NMR® Performance Report
Regional Hospital A
July, 2013 
Executive Summary
         This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure 
(ECM) PermaFrost NMR® in the DX split system supporting the fitness center within the Newark 
Regional Hospital A (Hospital A) at [Commercial Address], Newark, NJ. Detailed forensic performance testing (outlined 
later in this report) was performed on the nominal 15-ton split system using R410A refrigerant. Following 
testing, the system was treated with the proper amount and type of the PermaFrost NMR® technology 
specially formulated for this type of system. Measurement and Verification (M&V) was conducted 
pre-installation and post-gestation. 
The improvement in efficiency and restored capacity 
gained directly at the system was solely attributable to the 
PermaFrost NMR® ECM. This is a result of the reversal of 
thermal inefficiency on heat exchange surfaces.  
Following treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® 
technology, the relatively new 33-month old system 
showed an effective net 11.6% reduction in kW/ton based 
on the exact capacity measured in the baseline M&V and 
the post gestation M&V. With the 15-ton system operating 
at 100%, it showed a 14.1% reduction in kWh while 
simultaneously producing an increase in system efficiency of 18.1%. Prior to the ECM, the system produced 
13.29 tons of cooling. After the ECM, the tonnage produced by the system increased to 15.69 tons. This 
18.1% average capacity increase from the baseline performance level led to an effective average increase in 
COP of 13.1%. All of these factors directly correlate to what Hospital A will realize in energy savings as they 
operate the system in the future under the same parameters.

Following treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, the system also showed an 18% increase in 
the enthalpy delta, which is a critical HVAC measurement used to determine the thermodynamic 
enhancement brought about by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result of the ECM improvement is an ROI 
to Hospital A that is measured in months. The tables of data used to determine the financial payback are 
available for review at the end of this report. 
Product Brief
         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure 
(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, 
one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type 
of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and equipment that 
PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); chilled water systems 
(both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia refrigeration plants (single 
compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The equipment utilized in these 
systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single and multi-stage), scroll, 
reciprocating and screw configurations.
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and 
improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point temperatures in a more rapid 
fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced 
thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW hours used, less amp 
draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced carbon footprint for Hospital A.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) was utilized in the 
development of this report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating, 
Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization 
(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation 
methods and products.
There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They 
are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is 
defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single 
source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM 
affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term 
measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by 
short-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations 
using measurements of proxies of energy use. 
The final computation follows the formula:

Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces. 
A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the operational 
conditions of the CRAC units were satisfactory. Baseline M&V were recorded on both units and then the 
proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected. The gestation period for Hospital A pilot was 4 
weeks on these particular units to allow them to achieve the required ~250 hours of runtime on each to 
ensure adequate performance improvement time. At the end of this gestation period, Post M&V results 
were taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same or very similar 
entering air dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures. These are the two most critical measurements affected by 
the weather. When analyzing the data, no adjustments for weather were necessary. 
The following report incorporates the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol 
(IPMVP) as the M&V plan. Maintenance personnel from Hospital A witnessed the collection of all the data used 
in this report. The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer, 
[Senior Energy Engineer].  
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase)
 
 
BTUH = CFM * 4.5 (standard air) * Calculated Enthalpy Delta
 
 
kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
 
 
Percentage Eﬃciency = Measured BTUH / Manufacturers Design BTUH
 
 
Coeﬃcient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)

PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for Hospital A
Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Hospital A for 
implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to account for the amount of 
tonnage restored to the system. Once the percentage of improvement in capacity is determined, the kWh associated with 
the system in the Post is then reduced by the same percentage to account for the reduced number of hours the system 
will be required to run in the future to maintain the same set points. The average cost to operate the system prior to 
introduction of the ECM is then compared to the newly obtained cost to operate the system following the installation of 
the ECM to determine the estimated Payback Period for Hospital A.    
Baseline kWh         14.82 kW * 2,800 Annual Operating Hrs = 41,496 kWh
Cost to Run Baseline         41,496 kWh * $.15 = $6,224.40
Post ECM kWh         15.53 kW * 2,800 Annual Operating Hrs = 43,484 kWh
Revised kWh (based on 18% restored capacity)         43,484 kWh * (1 - .18) = 35,656.9 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Post         35,656.9 kWh * $.15 = $5,348.53
Avoided Energy Costs (Savings) Per Month         ($6,224.40- $5,348.53) / 12 = $69.99
Cost of ECM         $1,875
ROI         $1,875 / $69.99 = 26.8
 
ROI = 26 - 27 months
