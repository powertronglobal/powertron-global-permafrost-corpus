Detailed forensic performance testing (outlined \nlater in this report) was performed on the nominal 15-ton split system using R410A refrigerant. Following \ntesting, the system was treated with the proper amount and type of the PermaFrost NMR® technology \nspecially formulated for this type of system. Measurement and Verification (M&V) was conducted \npre-installation and post-gestation. \nThe improvement in efficiency and restored capacity \ngained directly at the system was solely attributable to the \nPermaFrost NMR® ECM. This is a result of the reversal of \nthermal inefficiency on heat exchange surfaces.  \nFollowing treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® \ntechnology, the relatively new 33-month old system \nshowed an effective net 11.6% reduction in kW/ton based \non the exact capacity measured in the baseline M&V and \nthe post gestation M&V. With the 15-ton system operating \nat 100%, it showed a 14.1% reduction in kWh while \nsimultaneously producing an increase in system efficiency of 18.1%. Prior to the ECM, the system produced \n13.29 tons of cooling. After the ECM, the tonnage produced by the system increased to 15.69 tons. This \n18.1% average capacity increase from the baseline performance level led to an effective average increase in \nCOP of 13.1%. All of these factors directly correlate to what Hospital A will realize in energy savings as they \noperate the system in the future under the same parameters.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 563, "chars": 2539, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_083_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:83bd19709723b9cd423155220472ebf902a721ff9a688216a2d667e032104bc1"}

The result of the ECM improvement is an ROI \nto Hospital A that is measured in months. The tables of data used to determine the financial payback are \navailable for review at the end of this report. \nProduct Brief\n         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure \n(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type \nof system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and equipment that \nPermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); chilled water systems \n(both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia refrigeration plants (single \ncompressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The equipment utilized in these \nsystems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single and multi-stage), scroll, \nreciprocating and screw configurations.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and \nimproved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point temperatures in a more rapid \nfashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced \nthermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW hours used, less amp \ndraw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced carbon footprint for Hospital A.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 516, "chars": 2449, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_083_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_083_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:0d1e4da84d4b2a210ecce7dd046337f3bb576711101a2267229939ba7823c7d7"}

The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating, \nRefrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization \n(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation \nmethods and products.\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is \ndefined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single \nsource of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM \naffected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations \nusing measurements of proxies of energy use. \nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+/ - Routine adjustments  + /- Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 440, "chars": 2187, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_083_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_083_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:d6bf274e7e4c4b57f0a717db2ef0831cab045f57ac5f0ebc1c1236ac9a065b49"}

Baseline M&V were recorded on both units and then the \nproper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected. The gestation period for Hospital A pilot was 4 \nweeks on these particular units to allow them to achieve the required ~250 hours of runtime on each to \nensure adequate performance improvement time. At the end of this gestation period, Post M&V results \nwere taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same or very similar \nentering air dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures. These are the two most critical measurements affected by \nthe weather. When analyzing the data, no adjustments for weather were necessary. \nThe following report incorporates the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol \n(IPMVP) as the M&V plan. Maintenance personnel from Hospital A witnessed the collection of all the data used \nin this report.
