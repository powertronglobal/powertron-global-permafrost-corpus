PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for Hospital A
Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Hospital A for 
implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to account for the amount of 
tonnage restored to the system. Once the percentage of improvement in capacity is determined, the kWh associated with 
the system in the Post is then reduced by the same percentage to account for the reduced number of hours the system 
will be required to run in the future to maintain the same set points. The average cost to operate the system prior to 
introduction of the ECM is then compared to the newly obtained cost to operate the system following the installation of 
the ECM to determine the estimated Payback Period for Hospital A.    
Baseline kWh         14.82 kW * 2,800 Annual Operating Hrs = 41,496 kWh
Cost to Run Baseline         41,496 kWh * $.15 = $6,224.40
Post ECM kWh         15.53 kW * 2,800 Annual Operating Hrs = 43,484 kWh
Revised kWh (based on 18% restored capacity)         43,484 kWh * (1 - .18) = 35,656.9 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Post         35,656.9 kWh * $.15 = $5,348.53
Avoided Energy Costs (Savings) Per Month         ($6,224.40- $5,348.53) / 12 = $69.99
Cost of ECM         $1,875
ROI         $1,875 / $69.99 = 26.8
 
ROI = 26 - 27 months
