HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report
Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study
Thermal degradation is well documented by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air 
Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). It is a major cause of 
capacity loss in Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (HVACR) systems, preventing them 
from operating at the original design efficiency soon after initial installation in the field. 
The purpose of this study is to verify the effectiveness of the PermaFrost NMR® Energy Conservation Measure 
(ECM) in the Package Unit (PU) pictured below at the Property Management Firm facility and document the future avoided energy 
costs associated with the same.
Summary Results
This comprehensive report contains specific information regarding the performance profile of the 35-ton PU at 
the Property Management Firm office building at [NYC Office Address].
  
At the conclusion of the pilot, the PU showed an 
annual 25,200 kWh reduction while increasing the 
capacity of the PU by 55.2% from 14.3 tons in the 
baseline to 22.2 tons in the post. The pilot PU also 
showed a 35.1% reduction in kW/ton and a similar 
35.1% reduction in annual kW usage. These 
efficiency improvements equate to an Initial 
Payback Period (IPP) of the ECM project for Property Management Firm 
of 6.7 months and a corresponding Internal Rate of 
Return (IRR) of 179%  
Further details of the measurements are described in the various sections later in this report. All testing was 
conducted by Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer] while being assisted and 
witnessed throughout by [Client Representative] of Property Management Firm.

Process
This report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of one of multiple PU units 
that support the NKGF Facility in [NYC Location]. 
Detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the pilot PU unit before and after 
the installation of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM to determine the impact on the three key elements that greatly 
affect NKGF’s HVAC power bill as they relate to the original design specifications:
 
 
1. The cooling capacity the PU unit is capable of producing after 21 years in service. 
 
2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the PU unit is delivering 
 
    as reflected in the kW/ton measurement. 
 
3. The thermal dynamic ability of the PU unit to still perform at or close to operational design.
Methodology
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the 
IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted of NKGF’s VP, 
Operations, [VP Operations]; Service Technician [Client Representative] and Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, 
[Senior Energy Engineer].  
Notes 
The boundary of the testing was the PU unit and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance 
calculations is very high.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the pilot PU unit to perform prior to and 
following the PermaFrost NMR® being installed. The report will also illustrate the amount of thermal 
degradation that has occurred due in large part to thermal degradation within the heat exchangers and how much of 
that has been restored after the ECM's introduction.
 
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• Tons = (Airflow * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta) / 12,000 
 
• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
 
• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Air Temp – Saturated Suction Temp 
Notes 
Following a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to determine the operational condition of the system was 
satisfactory, Baseline M&V data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. Four hundred hours after installation of 
PermaFrost NMR® ECM, the M&V team returned on a very similar weather day to the Baseline to take Post M&V 
measurements in the identical fashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements and associated calculations 
show the amount of capacity restored.
The following IPMVP data points were recorded on 26 June 2014 using recently calibrated devices by NIST (National 
Institutes of Standards and Technology) to insure measurement accuracy. The PU unit was then treated with 
PermaFrost NMR® on the same day and allowed to run at 67% load running two of the three compressors until 25 
August 2014 to ensure the patented surface science nanotechnology had ample time to seat into all the metal surfaces of 
the heat exchangers. All measurements were taken at 67% load and at similar return air and outdoor air temperatures. 
The collection of the data in both the baseline and post periods was collected by Powertron Global® under the watchful eye 
of the NKGF technician who maintains the unit. The measurements are listed below.

Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
PU Unit Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
NKGF has the problem of thermal degradation in its HVAC/R units.  The lower operating tonnage and COP 
ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. The 
degraded equipment performance is costing NKGF significant money and wasting energy. The equipment is 
using significantly more kWh to operate than it used when it was new. 
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the PU unit in the baseline and 
post testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. 
The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 7.9 operating tons and an 
improvement of 54% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the PU unit 
throughout the year.
The HVAC Equipment Manufacturer PU unit treated has a nominal capacity of 35 tons at 100% load at 85 degree entering air. During the 
testing period the system was operating at 67% load utilizing two of the three compressors. Since normal 
operations were not to be changed to accommodate the pilot, the emphasis here is on the delta between 
baseline and post.

Recovered Wasted Energy with PermaFrost NMR® -  PU Unit
The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration the PermaFrost NMR® created in the 
treated PU unit. The average cost to operate this unit 
before it was treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as 
calculated in kW/ton, was 2.02.
The specific cost to operate this unit after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, is currently 1.31.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ 
was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate 
for a 21 year old PU unit. The post results are also in 
line with the average improvement savings shown 
over more than 125,000 installations globally.

Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the NKGF PU Unit.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 14.3 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: 2.02 kW/ton * 22.2 tons = 44.84 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 44.84 kW * 1,600 Annual Operating Hrs = 71,744 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 71,744 kWh * $.31 = $22,241
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: 1.31 kW/ton * 22.2 tons = 29.08 kW
Annual kWh Post: 29.09 kW * 1,600 hours = 46,544 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 46,544 kWh * .31 cents = $14,429
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $22,241 - $14,429 = $7,812
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $7,812 / 12 = $651
Initial Payback Period
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot PU unit: $4,375
Estimated Initial Payback Period for Pilot PU Unit: $4,375 / 651= 6.7 months
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 179%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 893%
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous and subsequent pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent 
payback period for NKGF for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to 
calculate the true energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the 
annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems was 
when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and 
then subtracting the revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® ECM was 
installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the 
systems will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the internal 
building set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.

Notes
The pilot PU unit provides cooling to an office 
floor at the NKGF complex. Given the 
consistent building load, the pilot unit runs 
approximately 1,600 hours or more annually 
prior to PermaFrost NMR® being implemented.
RTU Load in both the Baseline and Post was 67%.  OAT 
was warmer in the Post so Post Amps were reduced 
slightly to adjust for this.

NKGF is Saving More than Just Energy
By treating just the pilot PU unit with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the current manner NKGF operates this 
unit, it will save approximately 25,200 kWh per year and all the costs associated with those savings. From an 
environmental impact standpoint, NKGF is also benefitting the surrounding community of [NYC Location]. 
Imagine how great the environmental impact will be when NKGF moves forward with treating all their 
climate control systems across the USA.
The 25,200 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 9.48 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from 
being released or any of the following:
