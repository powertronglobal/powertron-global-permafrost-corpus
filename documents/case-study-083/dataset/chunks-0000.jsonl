It is a major cause of \ncapacity loss in Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (HVACR) systems, preventing them \nfrom operating at the original design efficiency soon after initial installation in the field. \nThe purpose of this study is to verify the effectiveness of the PermaFrost NMR® Energy Conservation Measure \n(ECM) in the Package Unit (PU) pictured below at the Property Management Firm facility and document the future avoided energy \ncosts associated with the same.\nSummary Results\nThis comprehensive report contains specific information regarding the performance profile of the 35-ton PU at \nthe Property Management Firm office building at [NYC Office Address].\n  \nAt the conclusion of the pilot, the PU showed an \nannual 25,200 kWh reduction while increasing the \ncapacity of the PU by 55.2% from 14.3 tons in the \nbaseline to 22.2 tons in the post. The pilot PU also \nshowed a 35.1% reduction in kW/ton and a similar \n35.1% reduction in annual kW usage.

The cooling capacity the PU unit is capable of producing after 21 years in service. \n \n2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the PU unit is delivering \n \n    as reflected in the kW/ton measurement. \n \n3. The thermal dynamic ability of the PU unit to still perform at or close to operational design.\nMethodology\nThe measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the \nIPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted of NKGF’s VP, \nOperations, [VP Operations]; Service Technician [Client Representative] and Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, \n[Senior Energy Engineer].  \nNotes \nThe boundary of the testing was the PU unit and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance \ncalculations is very high.\n \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\n®\n3\nEnergy Conservation Method (ECM)\nThe content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the pilot PU unit to perform prior to and \nfollowing the PermaFrost NMR® being installed. The report will also illustrate the amount of thermal \ndegradation that has occurred due in large part to thermal degradation within the heat exchangers and how much of \nthat has been restored after the ECM's introduction.\n \nThe following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. \nThe results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:\n \n• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) \n \n• Tons = (Airflow * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta) / 12,000 \n \n• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage \n \n• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)\n \n• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Air Temp – Saturated Suction Temp \nNotes \nFollowing a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to determine the operational condition of the system was \nsatisfactory, Baseline M&V data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. Four hundred hours after installation of \nPermaFrost NMR® ECM, the M&V team returned on a very similar weather day to the Baseline to take Post M&V \nmeasurements in the identical fashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements and associated calculations \nshow the amount of capacity restored.\nThe following IPMVP data points were recorded on 26 June 2014 using recently calibrated devices by NIST (National \nInstitutes of Standards and Technology) to insure measurement accuracy. The PU unit was then treated with \nPermaFrost NMR® on the same day and allowed to run at 67% load running two of the three compressors until 25 \nAugust 2014 to ensure the patented surface science nanotechnology had ample time to seat into all the metal surfaces of \nthe heat exchangers. All measurements were taken at 67% load and at similar return air and outdoor air temperatures. \nThe collection of the data in both the baseline and post periods was collected by Powertron Global® under the watchful eye \nof the NKGF technician who maintains the unit. The measurements are listed below. \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 969, "chars": 4476, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_084_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_084_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:b79cd1d7f999800be0c34645867039e19714a4e804665c0178ee30c59aa8b434"}

The lower operating tonnage and COP \nratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. The \ndegraded equipment performance is costing NKGF significant money and wasting energy. The equipment is \nusing significantly more kWh to operate than it used when it was new. \nThe performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the PU unit in the baseline and \npost testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. \nThe implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 7.9 operating tons and an \nimprovement of 54% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the PU unit \nthroughout the year.\nThe HVAC Equipment Manufacturer PU unit treated has a nominal capacity of 35 tons at 100% load at 85 degree entering air. During the \ntesting period the system was operating at 67% load utilizing two of the three compressors. Since normal \noperations were not to be changed to accommodate the pilot, the emphasis here is on the delta between \nbaseline and post.  \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\n®\n5\n14.3 tons\n22.2 tons\nBaseline\nTonnage\nPost ECM\nTonnage\n• The PU should be operating @ 23.4 tons of cooling capacity\n• The PU was operating @ 14.3 tons of cooling capacity prior to\n   installing ECM\n• The PU now has 7.9 tons of restored cooling capacity after ECM\n• The PU should be operating @ 3 COP or higher\n• The PU was operating @ 1.74 COP prior to the ECM\n   and 2.68 following the ECM\n• The average COP of the PU was increased by 54%\n   following the ECM\n1.74\nBaseline COP\nCOEFFICIENT\nOF\nPERFORMANCE\n(COP)\n14.3\ntons Baseline\nCAPACITY\n@ 67%\nLOAD\nBaseline\nCOP\nPost ECM\nCOP\n1.74\n2.68\n2.68\nPost ECM COP\n22.2\ntons Post ECM\n54%\nImprovement\nin COP\n7.9\ntons of\nRecovered\nCapacity\nTONNAGE\nCOP\nNKGF PU Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 762, "chars": 3091, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 6}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_084_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_084_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:42dbf7c4ff2ef6139b1823d9f094088dcfd1cf0430783f4007cfa55c607773be"}
