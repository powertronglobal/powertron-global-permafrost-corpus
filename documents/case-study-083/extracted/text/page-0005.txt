Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
PU Unit Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
NKGF has the problem of thermal degradation in its HVAC/R units.  The lower operating tonnage and COP 
ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. The 
degraded equipment performance is costing NKGF significant money and wasting energy. The equipment is 
using significantly more kWh to operate than it used when it was new. 
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the PU unit in the baseline and 
post testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. 
The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 7.9 operating tons and an 
improvement of 54% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the PU unit 
throughout the year.
The HVAC Equipment Manufacturer PU unit treated has a nominal capacity of 35 tons at 100% load at 85 degree entering air. During the 
testing period the system was operating at 67% load utilizing two of the three compressors. Since normal 
operations were not to be changed to accommodate the pilot, the emphasis here is on the delta between 
baseline and post.
