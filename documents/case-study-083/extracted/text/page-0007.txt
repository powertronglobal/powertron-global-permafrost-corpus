Recovered Wasted Energy with PermaFrost NMR® -  PU Unit
The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration the PermaFrost NMR® created in the 
treated PU unit. The average cost to operate this unit 
before it was treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as 
calculated in kW/ton, was 2.02.
The specific cost to operate this unit after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, is currently 1.31.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ 
was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate 
for a 21 year old PU unit. The post results are also in 
line with the average improvement savings shown 
over more than 125,000 installations globally.
