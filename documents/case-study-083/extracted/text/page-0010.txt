NKGF is Saving More than Just Energy
By treating just the pilot PU unit with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the current manner NKGF operates this 
unit, it will save approximately 25,200 kWh per year and all the costs associated with those savings. From an 
environmental impact standpoint, NKGF is also benefitting the surrounding community of [NYC Location]. 
Imagine how great the environmental impact will be when NKGF moves forward with treating all their 
climate control systems across the USA.
The 25,200 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 9.48 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from 
being released or any of the following:
