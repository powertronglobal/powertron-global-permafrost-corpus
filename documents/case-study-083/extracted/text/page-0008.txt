Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the NKGF PU Unit.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 14.3 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: 2.02 kW/ton * 22.2 tons = 44.84 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 44.84 kW * 1,600 Annual Operating Hrs = 71,744 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 71,744 kWh * $.31 = $22,241
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: 1.31 kW/ton * 22.2 tons = 29.08 kW
Annual kWh Post: 29.09 kW * 1,600 hours = 46,544 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 46,544 kWh * .31 cents = $14,429
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $22,241 - $14,429 = $7,812
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $7,812 / 12 = $651
Initial Payback Period
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot PU unit: $4,375
Estimated Initial Payback Period for Pilot PU Unit: $4,375 / 651= 6.7 months
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 179%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 893%
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous and subsequent pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent 
payback period for NKGF for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to 
calculate the true energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the 
annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems was 
when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and 
then subtracting the revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® ECM was 
installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the 
systems will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the internal 
building set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
