Notes
The pilot PU unit provides cooling to an office 
floor at the NKGF complex. Given the 
consistent building load, the pilot unit runs 
approximately 1,600 hours or more annually 
prior to PermaFrost NMR® being implemented.
RTU Load in both the Baseline and Post was 67%.  OAT 
was warmer in the Post so Post Amps were reduced 
slightly to adjust for this.
