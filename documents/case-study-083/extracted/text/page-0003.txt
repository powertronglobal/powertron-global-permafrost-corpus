Process
This report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of one of multiple PU units 
that support the NKGF Facility in [NYC Location]. 
Detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the pilot PU unit before and after 
the installation of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM to determine the impact on the three key elements that greatly 
affect NKGF’s HVAC power bill as they relate to the original design specifications:
 
 
1. The cooling capacity the PU unit is capable of producing after 21 years in service. 
 
2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the PU unit is delivering 
 
    as reflected in the kW/ton measurement. 
 
3. The thermal dynamic ability of the PU unit to still perform at or close to operational design.
Methodology
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the 
IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted of NKGF’s VP, 
Operations, [VP Operations]; Service Technician [Client Representative] and Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, 
[Senior Energy Engineer].  
Notes 
The boundary of the testing was the PU unit and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance 
calculations is very high.
