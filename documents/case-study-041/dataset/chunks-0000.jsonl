Detailed forensic performance testing (outlined later in this report) was \nperformed on the two RTUs, the first a 5-ton RTU supporting the rear break area and the second a 10-ton \nRTU supporting the front Lobby and waiting area. Both of the RTUs are using R22 refrigerant.  Following \ntesting, the RTUs were treated with the proper amount and type of the PermaFrost NMR® technology \nspecially formulated for these types of systems.  Measurement and Verification (M&V) was conducted \npre-installation and post-gestation.\nThe improvement in efficiency and restored \ncapacity gained directly at the units was solely \nattributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. This \nis a result of the reversal of thermal inefficiency on heat \nexchange surfaces. \nFollowing treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® \ntechnology, the RTUs showed an effective net \naverage 22.8% reduction in kW/ton based on the \nexact capacity measured in the baseline M&V and \nthe post gestation M&V. With each of the RTUs \noperating at 100%, the units showed an average \n6.3% reduction in kWh while simultaneously producing 2.11 more tons or 18.2% more overall system \ncapacity.  Prior to the ECM, the RTUs were averaging 73.5% of design capacity as measured in-situ. After the \nECM, the RTUs jumped up to 89.4% of original design specification. This 15.9% efficiency improvement \ncompared to design combined with the 25% improvement in refrigerant approach from the baseline \nperformance levels led to an effective average increase in COP of 31.6%. All of these factors directly correlate \nto what Company A will realize in energy savings as they operate these RTUs in the future as well as all \ntheir other HVAC equipment like Roof Top Units and Chillers under the similar parameters. \nEnergy Science Division\nThe 10-ton Lobby RTU (similar to the one pictured above) runs \napproximately 3,000 annually, while the smaller Break Area RTU runs \nonly approximately 2,000 annually. Both RTUs were put into service \nin 2005.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 728, "chars": 3120, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_043_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:acf3174bab523df9733949900a7051fa4e972963e2183ba053599548e5f9797e"}

This is \nillustrated by the 22.3% increase in the enthalpy delta, which is a critical HVAC measurement used to \ndetermine the thermodynamic enhancement brought about by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result \nof the ECM improvement is an ROI to Company A that is measured in months. The tables of data \nused to determine the financial payback are available for review at the end of this report.\n  \nProduct Brief\n         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure \n(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative® (NMR™) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for at least 10 years in any \ntype of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and \nequipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); \nchilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia \nrefrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The \nequipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal \n(single and multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® in any type of HVACR system are improved cooling \nperformance, increased capacity and improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to \nachieve set point temperatures in a more rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. \nThe indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment \ninclude reduced run time, less kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life \ncycle time and a reduced carbon footprint for Company A.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 567, "chars": 2687, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_043_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_043_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:5e26788a34f670236055e5f91beee79fe42294f8b8056a044da50fdf3abff5bc"}

The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating, \nRefrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization \n(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation \nmethods and products.\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is \ndefined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single \nsource of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM \naffected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations \nusing measurements of proxies of energy use. \nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+/ - Routine Adjustments +/ - Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 446, "chars": 2211, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_043_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_043_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:ed20d39ca9f3b5fc9415b674a1fdb369e0d456c893e8c44001c42c543d284f8b"}

Baseline M&V were recorded on both RTUs and then the proper \namount and type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected. The gestation period for the Company A pilot was just 21 \ndays on these particular units to allow them to achieve the required ~200 hours of runtime on each to ensure \nadequate performance improvement time. At the end of this gestation period, Post M&V results were taken \nin the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same or very similar entering air \ndry bulb and wet bulb temperatures, discharge pressures and of course outdoor air temperatures (OAT). \nThese are three of the most critical variables to contend with in an in-situ testing situation. When analyzing \nall of the data baseline and post data, no adjustments for weather were deemed necessary. \nThe following report produces the utilization of the International Performance Measurement and \nVerification Protocol (IPMVP) as the M&V plan. Company A's CFO, [Client CFO], authorized the pilot.  The data \nwas collected and final calculations performed by Powertron Global®’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer, \n[Senior Energy Engineer].\nThe results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:\n \nkW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) \n \nBTUH = CFM * 4.5 (standard air) * Calculated Enthalpy Delta\n \nkW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage \n \nPercentage Eﬃciency = Measured BTUH / Manufacturers Design BTUH\n \nCoeﬃcient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 553, "chars": 2452, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_043_chunk_0003", "next_id": "pdf_043_chunk_0005", "content_hash": "sha256:c21c876d33e3ec367506b3799914b02a95489e56c2977b9c0b1353387f67df3a"}
