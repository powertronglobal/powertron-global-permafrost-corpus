PermaFrost NMR® Eﬃciency Report
Company A  
August, 2013
Executive Summary
         This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure (ECM) 
PermaFrost NMR® in two HVAC Roof Top Units (RTUs) supporting the Company A Diagnostic Clinic located at 
[Brooklyn Location].  Detailed forensic performance testing (outlined later in this report) was 
performed on the two RTUs, the first a 5-ton RTU supporting the rear break area and the second a 10-ton 
RTU supporting the front Lobby and waiting area. Both of the RTUs are using R22 refrigerant.  Following 
testing, the RTUs were treated with the proper amount and type of the PermaFrost NMR® technology 
specially formulated for these types of systems.  Measurement and Verification (M&V) was conducted 
pre-installation and post-gestation.
The improvement in efficiency and restored 
capacity gained directly at the units was solely 
attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. This 
is a result of the reversal of thermal inefficiency on heat 
exchange surfaces. 
Following treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® 
technology, the RTUs showed an effective net 
average 22.8% reduction in kW/ton based on the 
exact capacity measured in the baseline M&V and 
the post gestation M&V. With each of the RTUs 
operating at 100%, the units showed an average 
6.3% reduction in kWh while simultaneously producing 2.11 more tons or 18.2% more overall system 
capacity.  Prior to the ECM, the RTUs were averaging 73.5% of design capacity as measured in-situ. After the 
ECM, the RTUs jumped up to 89.4% of original design specification. This 15.9% efficiency improvement 
compared to design combined with the 25% improvement in refrigerant approach from the baseline 
performance levels led to an effective average increase in COP of 31.6%. All of these factors directly correlate 
to what Company A will realize in energy savings as they operate these RTUs in the future as well as all 
their other HVAC equipment like Roof Top Units and Chillers under the similar parameters. 
Energy Science Division
The 10-ton Lobby RTU (similar to the one pictured above) runs 
approximately 3,000 annually, while the smaller Break Area RTU runs 
only approximately 2,000 annually. Both RTUs were put into service 
in 2005.

Following treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, the two RTUs also showed a slight 
reduction in measured Amps and Volts while at the same time producing more cooling. This is 
illustrated by the 22.3% increase in the enthalpy delta, which is a critical HVAC measurement used to 
determine the thermodynamic enhancement brought about by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result 
of the ECM improvement is an ROI to Company A that is measured in months. The tables of data 
used to determine the financial payback are available for review at the end of this report.
  
Product Brief
         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure 
(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative® (NMR™) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, 
one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for at least 10 years in any 
type of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and 
equipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); 
chilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia 
refrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The 
equipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal 
(single and multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® in any type of HVACR system are improved cooling 
performance, increased capacity and improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to 
achieve set point temperatures in a more rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. 
The indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment 
include reduced run time, less kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life 
cycle time and a reduced carbon footprint for Company A.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) was utilized in the 
development of this report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating, 
Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization 
(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation 
methods and products.
There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They 
are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is 
defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single 
source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM 
affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term 
measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by 
short-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations 
using measurements of proxies of energy use. 
The final computation follows the formula:
Energy Science Division
Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy
+/ - Routine Adjustments +/ - Non-Routine Adjustments

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces. 
A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the operational 
conditions of the RTUs were satisfactory. Baseline M&V were recorded on both RTUs and then the proper 
amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected. The gestation period for the Company A pilot was just 21 
days on these particular units to allow them to achieve the required ~200 hours of runtime on each to ensure 
adequate performance improvement time. At the end of this gestation period, Post M&V results were taken 
in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same or very similar entering air 
dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures, discharge pressures and of course outdoor air temperatures (OAT). 
These are three of the most critical variables to contend with in an in-situ testing situation. When analyzing 
all of the data baseline and post data, no adjustments for weather were deemed necessary. 
The following report produces the utilization of the International Performance Measurement and 
Verification Protocol (IPMVP) as the M&V plan. Company A's CFO, [Client CFO], authorized the pilot.  The data 
was collected and final calculations performed by Powertron Global®’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer, 
[Senior Energy Engineer].
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
BTUH = CFM * 4.5 (standard air) * Calculated Enthalpy Delta
 
kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
 
Percentage Eﬃciency = Measured BTUH / Manufacturers Design BTUH
 
Coeﬃcient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)

Detailed Results for Company A Roof Top Units
System Description / Design Characteristics
These units provide comfort cooling for the for the rear break area and front lobby/waiting areas respectively 
located at [Brooklyn Location].  Given much of the load in the two areas being served are very much 
dependent on patient and staff traffic in and out, it is estimated that the 5-ton RTU operates ~2,000 per year and 
the 10-ton RTU operates ~3,000 hours per year prior to the ECM being implemented.  
Baseline and Post Measurements
The identical IPMVP following data points were recorded for Baseline and Post on 7/15/13 and 8/6/13 
respectively using recently NIST calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. The Return Air dry bulb 
and wet bulb temperatures entering the coil were very similar in both periods as were the discharge pressures 
of the compressors. The OAT was also very similar, being just 2.6 degrees cooler in the Post so no adjustments 
were made to the calculations. The measurements are as follows:

Results
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period of the two RTUs prior using regression analysis. 
PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for Company A
Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Company A 
Diagnostics for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the 
true energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This greater capacity reduces the runtime hours and 
in turn reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post. The true ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the 
units was when operating at their original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of tonnage and then 
subtracting the new cost to run the units at this same newly restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM 
was installed. This regression calculation is the most scientific method of accounting for the reduced number of hours 
the units will now run due to their increased capacity which allows the units to reach set temperatures quicker and 
shut off sooner.   
Avg. Adjusted kW Baseline        1.251 Avg kW/ton * 6.84 Avg tons = Avg 8.56 kW
Avg. Adjusted Baseline kWh        8.56 kW * 2,500 Avg Annual Operating Hrs = 21,400 kWh
Avg. Revised Cost to Run Baseline        21,400 kWh * $.18 = $3,852.00
