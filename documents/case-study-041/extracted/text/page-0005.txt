Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces. 
A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the operational 
conditions of the RTUs were satisfactory. Baseline M&V were recorded on both RTUs and then the proper 
amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected. The gestation period for the Company A pilot was just 21 
days on these particular units to allow them to achieve the required ~200 hours of runtime on each to ensure 
adequate performance improvement time. At the end of this gestation period, Post M&V results were taken 
in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same or very similar entering air 
dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures, discharge pressures and of course outdoor air temperatures (OAT). 
These are three of the most critical variables to contend with in an in-situ testing situation. When analyzing 
all of the data baseline and post data, no adjustments for weather were deemed necessary. 
The following report produces the utilization of the International Performance Measurement and 
Verification Protocol (IPMVP) as the M&V plan. Company A's CFO, [Client CFO], authorized the pilot.  The data 
was collected and final calculations performed by Powertron Global®’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer, 
[Senior Energy Engineer].
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
BTUH = CFM * 4.5 (standard air) * Calculated Enthalpy Delta
 
kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
 
Percentage Eﬃciency = Measured BTUH / Manufacturers Design BTUH
 
Coeﬃcient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
