The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period of the two RTUs prior using regression analysis. 
PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for Company A
Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Company A 
Diagnostics for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the 
true energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This greater capacity reduces the runtime hours and 
in turn reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post. The true ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the 
units was when operating at their original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of tonnage and then 
subtracting the new cost to run the units at this same newly restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM 
was installed. This regression calculation is the most scientific method of accounting for the reduced number of hours 
the units will now run due to their increased capacity which allows the units to reach set temperatures quicker and 
shut off sooner.   
Avg. Adjusted kW Baseline        1.251 Avg kW/ton * 6.84 Avg tons = Avg 8.56 kW
Avg. Adjusted Baseline kWh        8.56 kW * 2,500 Avg Annual Operating Hrs = 21,400 kWh
Avg. Revised Cost to Run Baseline        21,400 kWh * $.18 = $3,852.00
