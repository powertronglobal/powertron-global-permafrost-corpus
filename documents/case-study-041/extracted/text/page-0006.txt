Detailed Results for Company A Roof Top Units
System Description / Design Characteristics
These units provide comfort cooling for the for the rear break area and front lobby/waiting areas respectively 
located at [Brooklyn Location].  Given much of the load in the two areas being served are very much 
dependent on patient and staff traffic in and out, it is estimated that the 5-ton RTU operates ~2,000 per year and 
the 10-ton RTU operates ~3,000 hours per year prior to the ECM being implemented.  
Baseline and Post Measurements
The identical IPMVP following data points were recorded for Baseline and Post on 7/15/13 and 8/6/13 
respectively using recently NIST calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. The Return Air dry bulb 
and wet bulb temperatures entering the coil were very similar in both periods as were the discharge pressures 
of the compressors. The OAT was also very similar, being just 2.6 degrees cooler in the Post so no adjustments 
were made to the calculations. The measurements are as follows:
