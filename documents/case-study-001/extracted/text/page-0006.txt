Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces.
A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the unit’s operational 
conditions were satisfactory.  Baseline measurements were recorded and then the proper amount and type 
of PermaFrost NMR® was injected.  The product was then allowed three (3) weeks to seat itself into the 
metal surfaces before post measurements were taken again to establish the efficiency gains. 
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP International Performance Measurement and 
Verification Protocol as the M&V plan.  The measurements and final calculations were performed and 
certified by Powertron Global’s Senior Energy Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer], ME/CEM/CMC/CMVP.
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
kW = Volts * Amps *  .9/1000 - for Single Phase
 
Dry Bulb Delta = Entering Air DB – Leaving Air DB
 
Enthalpy = Return Air WB Deg. F and Supply Air WB Deg. F converted to Enthalpy 
 
(Enthalpy not applicable when measuring heat pumps or refrigeration units)
 
Actual Btuh Capacity = Measured CFM * 1.08 * DB Delta (Baseline – Post)
 
System Eﬃciency % = Actual Coil Capacity Btuh / Nominal Coil Capacity Btuh
 
EER = Btuh / Adjusted Watts
