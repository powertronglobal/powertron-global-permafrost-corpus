Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to determine a very accurate ROI for 
Sports Arena A for implementing this ECM:
Baseline kWh = (1,094.9 CTW / 1,000) * 7,300 Annual Operating Hrs = 7,992.8 kWh
Baseline Cost To Run = 7,992.8 kWh * $.10 = $799.28
Regression Analysis is then used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Pilot Unit  
Adjusted Base Tonnage = .54 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted Total Watts = 2,280 WPT * .54 tons = 1,230 TW
Adjusted Base kWh = (1,230 TW/1,000) * 7,300 Annual Operating Hrs = 8,981 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM = 8,981 kWh * $.10 = $898
Post ECM kWh = (1,101.5 NTW / 1,000) * 7,300 Annual Operating Hrs = 8,041 kWh
Cost to Run After ECM = 8,041 kWh * $.10 = $804
Cost Savings per Month = ($898 - $804) / 12 = $7.80
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed @ $125 / $7.80 = 16
 
ROI = 16 months
