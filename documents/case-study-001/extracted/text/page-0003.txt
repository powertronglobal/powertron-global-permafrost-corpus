Since the air temperatures inside the arena were similar in 
both the baseline and post measurement periods as was 
the entering air temperature into evaporator coil, no 
adjustments for weather were required. 
Following treatment with PermaFrost NMR®, the pilot 
unit showed an average 10.5% reduction in both total 
Watts and Watts/Ton, while at the same time, producing 
an increase in capacity of 713 Btuh, equating to 12.4% 
more Btuh.  The unit also showed an improvement in EER 
of 11.7%.  Additionally, the pilot unit showed an average 
of 11.7% improvement in system efficiency, which is 
another very measurable way to view the thermodynamic 
enhancement of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result 
of the average ECM improvements is an ROI to Sports Arena A of 
16 months.  The tables of data and financial calculations 
are available for review at the end of this report.
