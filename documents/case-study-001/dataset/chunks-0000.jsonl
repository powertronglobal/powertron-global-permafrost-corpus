[Client Representative], Heating, \nVentilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (HVAC/R) Supervisor for the facility, personally witnessed \nall phases of the testing and data collection. \nThe 6,500 Btu refrigeration system supporting the “Hot, \nPopped & Twisted” concession area uses R-22 refrigerant \nand was installed when the facility opened in 2001.\nOn average, the unit runs 7,300 hours each year.\nImmediately following the baseline testing, the unit was \ntreated with 1 unit of the PermaFrost NMR® product \nspecially formulated for R-22 DX systems.\nSince there were no other ECM’s going on during this pilot project, \nthe improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly \nat the unit is solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  \nEven though there was only a light load on the unit during the \nslightly abbreviated testing period (3 weeks versus the normal 4 \nweeks), the pilot was still a success.  The unit now provides colder \nsupply air and more Btu’s while using less watts per ton.  This \ngreater operational efficiency is due to the restoration of the heat \ntransfer ability of the evaporator and condenser coils, less metal-to- \nmetal friction and improved refrigerant flow.  As the runtime and \ncooler load increases in the next month the improvements will \ncontinue to climb. In over 108,000 installations to date, the average \nimprovement for a unit similar in age to this is over 20%.  \nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 597, "chars": 2666, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_014_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:1352b9b1d3af61aaa3d26ddfd95313c419f7665d38d5513c0dae68a4546bd118"}

The unit also showed an improvement in EER \nof 11.7%.  Additionally, the pilot unit showed an average \nof 11.7% improvement in system efficiency, which is \nanother very measurable way to view the thermodynamic \nenhancement of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result \nof the average ECM improvements is an ROI to Sports Arena A of \n16 months.

A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any \ntype of system in which it is installed – DX (direct expansion air and chilled water systems), Chillers \n(screw, reciprocating, scroll and centrifugal), heat pumps, ice making equipment.  Specialized \napplications include computer room cooling and dehumidification systems, chiller plants (water and ice \nproduction applications), domestic and industrial refrigeration (ammonia low and ultra low \ntemperature), air-cooled single application water chillers and split and package rooftop HVAC \nequipment.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and \nimproved refrigerant velocity – all of which allows a system to achieve set point temperatures in a more \nrapid fashion which reduces system loading and operating periods.  The indirect benefits resulting from \nthe enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW \nhours used, less amp draw at the compressor, less metallic wear, longer overall equipment life and a \nreduced carbon footprint for Sports Arena A.\nEnergy Science Division\nOIL BUILD-UP\nOIL REMOVED\nBEFORE TREATMENT\nAFTER TREATMENT\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 714, "chars": 3272, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_014_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_014_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:06cc4f7b29da05eac71c15788d1cb0b56968567dd707874f632ce8120a39a833"}

The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and \nAir-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the \nIPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and \nproducts.\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize.  They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.  Option B is \ndefined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single \nsource of measurement.  Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM \naffected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B, short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained.  The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using \nmeasurements of proxies of energy use. \nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+ /- Routine adjustments + /- Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 458, "chars": 2251, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_014_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_014_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:22dffb57b8d67dca902e8a79a9bc2cd742959b0dc3e51f1fdf8569ec855bca69"}
