PermaFrost NMR® Walk-in Cooler Performance Report
Sports Arena A
January 14, 2013
Executive Summary
        This report contains specific information regarding the detailed forensic performance testing (outlined 
later in this report) of the energy control measure (ECM) PermaFrost NMR® in one of the many walk-in 
cooler units within Sports Arena A (Sports Arena A) in [Texas Location].  [Client Representative], Heating, 
Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (HVAC/R) Supervisor for the facility, personally witnessed 
all phases of the testing and data collection. 
The 6,500 Btu refrigeration system supporting the “Hot, 
Popped & Twisted” concession area uses R-22 refrigerant 
and was installed when the facility opened in 2001.
On average, the unit runs 7,300 hours each year.
Immediately following the baseline testing, the unit was 
treated with 1 unit of the PermaFrost NMR® product 
specially formulated for R-22 DX systems.
Since there were no other ECM’s going on during this pilot project, 
the improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly 
at the unit is solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  
Even though there was only a light load on the unit during the 
slightly abbreviated testing period (3 weeks versus the normal 4 
weeks), the pilot was still a success.  The unit now provides colder 
supply air and more Btu’s while using less watts per ton.  This 
greater operational efficiency is due to the restoration of the heat 
transfer ability of the evaporator and condenser coils, less metal-to- 
metal friction and improved refrigerant flow.  As the runtime and 
cooler load increases in the next month the improvements will 
continue to climb. In over 108,000 installations to date, the average 
improvement for a unit similar in age to this is over 20%.

Since the air temperatures inside the arena were similar in 
both the baseline and post measurement periods as was 
the entering air temperature into evaporator coil, no 
adjustments for weather were required. 
Following treatment with PermaFrost NMR®, the pilot 
unit showed an average 10.5% reduction in both total 
Watts and Watts/Ton, while at the same time, producing 
an increase in capacity of 713 Btuh, equating to 12.4% 
more Btuh.  The unit also showed an improvement in EER 
of 11.7%.  Additionally, the pilot unit showed an average 
of 11.7% improvement in system efficiency, which is 
another very measurable way to view the thermodynamic 
enhancement of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result 
of the average ECM improvements is an ROI to Sports Arena A of 
16 months.  The tables of data and financial calculations 
are available for review at the end of this report.

Product Brief
         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure 
(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) technology as its core agent.  A sustainable, 
one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any 
type of system in which it is installed – DX (direct expansion air and chilled water systems), Chillers 
(screw, reciprocating, scroll and centrifugal), heat pumps, ice making equipment.  Specialized 
applications include computer room cooling and dehumidification systems, chiller plants (water and ice 
production applications), domestic and industrial refrigeration (ammonia low and ultra low 
temperature), air-cooled single application water chillers and split and package rooftop HVAC 
equipment.
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and 
improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allows a system to achieve set point temperatures in a more 
rapid fashion which reduces system loading and operating periods.  The indirect benefits resulting from 
the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW 
hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, less metallic wear, longer overall equipment life and a 
reduced carbon footprint for Sports Arena A.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocols (IPMVP) are used to develop this 
report.  The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and 
Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the 
IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and 
products.
There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize.  They 
are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.  Option B is 
defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single 
source of measurement.  Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM 
affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B, short-term 
measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained.  The savings are calculated by 
short-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using 
measurements of proxies of energy use. 
The final computation follows the formula:
Energy Science Division
Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy
+ /- Routine adjustments + /- Non-Routine Adjustments

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces.
A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the unit’s operational 
conditions were satisfactory.  Baseline measurements were recorded and then the proper amount and type 
of PermaFrost NMR® was injected.  The product was then allowed three (3) weeks to seat itself into the 
metal surfaces before post measurements were taken again to establish the efficiency gains. 
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP International Performance Measurement and 
Verification Protocol as the M&V plan.  The measurements and final calculations were performed and 
certified by Powertron Global’s Senior Energy Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer], ME/CEM/CMC/CMVP.
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
kW = Volts * Amps *  .9/1000 - for Single Phase
 
Dry Bulb Delta = Entering Air DB – Leaving Air DB
 
Enthalpy = Return Air WB Deg. F and Supply Air WB Deg. F converted to Enthalpy 
 
(Enthalpy not applicable when measuring heat pumps or refrigeration units)
 
Actual Btuh Capacity = Measured CFM * 1.08 * DB Delta (Baseline – Post)
 
System Eﬃciency % = Actual Coil Capacity Btuh / Nominal Coil Capacity Btuh
 
EER = Btuh / Adjusted Watts

Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to determine a very accurate ROI for 
Sports Arena A for implementing this ECM:
Baseline kWh = (1,094.9 CTW / 1,000) * 7,300 Annual Operating Hrs = 7,992.8 kWh
Baseline Cost To Run = 7,992.8 kWh * $.10 = $799.28
Regression Analysis is then used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Pilot Unit  
Adjusted Base Tonnage = .54 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted Total Watts = 2,280 WPT * .54 tons = 1,230 TW
Adjusted Base kWh = (1,230 TW/1,000) * 7,300 Annual Operating Hrs = 8,981 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM = 8,981 kWh * $.10 = $898
Post ECM kWh = (1,101.5 NTW / 1,000) * 7,300 Annual Operating Hrs = 8,041 kWh
Cost to Run After ECM = 8,041 kWh * $.10 = $804
Cost Savings per Month = ($898 - $804) / 12 = $7.80
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed @ $125 / $7.80 = 16
 
ROI = 16 months
