By recording the conditions at those entry and \ndeparture points the overall cooling results can be compared to the overall power \nconsumed to quantify the power costs per unit of cooling kW/Ton (kilowatt-per-\nton), EER (Energy Efficiency Ratio) & COP (Co-Efficient of Performance). \nB. \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \nThe average efficiency improvements per system are: \nUNIT\t\n  #3\t\n  \nkW/Ton\t\n  \nCOP\t\n  \nEER\t\n  \nBaseline\t\n  \n1.49\t\n  \n2.43\t\n  \n8.27\t\n  \nPost\t\n  \n1.12\t\n  \n3.15\t\n  \n10.76\t\n  \nImprovement\t\n  %\t\n  \n24.8%\t\n  \n29.6%\t\n  \n30.1%\t\n  \nUNIT\t\n  #4\t\n  \nkW/Ton\t\n  \nCOP\t\n  \nEER\t\n  \nBaseline\t\n  \n1.56\t\n  \n2.43\t\n  \n8.29\t\n  \nPost\t\n  \n0.71\t\n  \n5.04\t\n  \n17.2\t\n  \nImprovement\t\n  %\t\n  \n54.5%\t\n  \n107.4%\t\n  \n107.5%\t\n  \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website.

The objective of measuring overall power consumed \nby an HVAC system can be realized by measuring voltage, amperage and power \nfactor.  \nFor these specific HVAC systems many parameters were measured every two \nseconds for a period of seven (7) days for the development of a scientific \nbaseline of performance and a post period of seven (7) days for the development \nof a scientific post analysis of performance. Data was extracted from the \nparameters measured every five (5) seconds during the normal operating hours \nof 9am to 5pm.  \nTotal BTUH was developed along with total kW consumption by measuring all \nrequired data points (13 points see appendix for points measured) and entering \nthem into industry best practice engineering formulae. All measurement hardware \nwas certified under NIST or CE standards. Engineering formulae was developed \nby AHRI / ASHRAE (American Heating and Refrigeration Institute / American \nSociety of Heating Refrigeration & Air Conditioning Engineers) \nDuring regular business hours the outdoor air temperature entering the air-cooled \ncondenser coils of each unit will affect the design capacity. Therefore we have \nprovided baseline and post analysis of the seven (7) day periods at several \noutdoor air temperature intervals so as to provide the comparison of improved \ncapacity and subsequent kW per ton, EER and COP across a variation of \noutdoor air temperatures consisting of a eleven (11) degree span (80-90 degrees \nF). \nD.  \nCONCLUSION \nTesting validates that the PermaFrost NMR product does improve HVAC/R \nenergy efficiency when added to the refrigerant circuit of a cooling system. \nASHRAE estimates that air-conditioning will lose 30% of its cooling capacity due \nto the thermal degradation of internal surfaces. Higher percentages up to 40% \nhave been observed in systems that have extremely high runtimes.  \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website.

Running the compressor(s) less significantly reduces energy \nconsumption. In this case Unit #3 and #4 had significantly less runtime hours with \nmatching weather data.
