A. 
INTRODUCTION 
From August 1, to September 3, 2016 at the Botanical Gardens A, 
testing was implemented to verify energy reduction through the Powertron Global 
product PermaFrost NMR affecting the refrigerant circuits of two 15-Ton package 
DX units. 
Unit #3 - Carrier 48HJM017- 72088, Mfg Date 2003, R-22 equipped 
Unit #4 - Carrier 48HJM017- 72088, Mfg Date 2003, R-22 equipped 
The testing was designed to monitor the operation of the systems before and 
after the installation of PermaFrost NMR and to verify the amount of capacity 
restoration and the resulted energy savings.  
The monitoring isolates the entry and departure points of the medium being 
cooled and the power being used. By recording the conditions at those entry and 
departure points the overall cooling results can be compared to the overall power 
consumed to quantify the power costs per unit of cooling kW/Ton (kilowatt-per-
ton), EER (Energy Efficiency Ratio) & COP (Co-Efficient of Performance).
