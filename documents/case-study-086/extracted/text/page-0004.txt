PermaFrost NMR restored the system to near or its intended design capacity. 
The opportunity for improvement varies based upon the amount of thermal 
degradation present which is derived from total amount of runtime hours over its 
service life (age), the loading of the unit and the application such and DX verses 
water-cooled chiller.  
Mechanical equipment that consumes power predominately to operate a 
refrigeration compressor (water or air-cooled DX, water or air-cooled chillers, ice 
machines, etc.) will significantly benefit from the PermaFrost NMR treatment due 
to restored capacity therefore lowering the kW/Ton. 
In addition to lowering the kW/Ton of the equipment, additional benefit is found 
when the system can cycle off a compressor due to the additional capacity 
restored. Running the compressor(s) less significantly reduces energy 
consumption. In this case Unit #3 and #4 had significantly less runtime hours with 
matching weather data. Please Appendixes I & II for details.
