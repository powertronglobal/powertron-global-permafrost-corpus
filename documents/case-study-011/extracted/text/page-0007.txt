The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the Major NYC University College Chiller.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 559.4 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: .616 kW/ton * 661.1 tons = 407.24 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 407.24 kW * 4,200 Annual Operating Hrs = 1,710,408 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 1,710,408 kWh * $.16 = $273,665
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: .524 kW/ton * 661.1 tons = 346.42 kW
Annual kWh Post: 346.42 kW * 4,200 hours = 1,454,964 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 1,454,964 kWh * .16 cents = $232,794
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $273,665 - $232,794 = $40,871
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $40,871 / 12 = $3,406
Return On Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot chiller: $24,000
Estimated ROI Period for Chiller: $24,000 / $3,406 = 7 months
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for 
Major NYC University College for implementing the PermaFrost NMR®, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true 
energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in 
the Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems was when operating at the 
original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the 
revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® was installed. This regression 
analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the systems will now operate 
due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the internal building set points with 
increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
