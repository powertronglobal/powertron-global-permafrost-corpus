Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Chiller Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Major NYC University College and CUNY have the problem of thermal degradation in its HVAC/R units. The lower baseline 
operating tonnage and COP ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost 
to operate numbers. The degraded equipment performance was costing Major NYC University College significant money and 
wasting energy. The equipment was using significantly more kWh to operate than it used when it was new. 
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the chiller in the baseline and post 
testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. 
The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 101.7 operating tons and an 
improvement of 17.7% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the 
chiller throughout the year.
The York chiller treated has a nominal capacity of 675 tons at 90% load and 1,500 gallons per minute (GPM) flow 
through the evaporator.  The chiller used in this pilot was tested at 90% load but with a GPM flow much higher 
than design. Since normal operations were not to be changed for the pilot (i.e., adjusting the water flow through 
both the evaporator and condensing barrels), the emphasis here is on the delta between baseline and post.
