Recovered Wasted Energy with PermaFrost NMR® -  Chiller
The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration PermaFrost NMR® created in the treated 
chiller. The average cost to operate this chiller before it 
was treated, as calculated in kW/ton, was .616.
The specific cost to operate this chiller after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, is currently .524.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ 
was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate 
for a 22 year old chiller. The post results are also in 
line with the average improvement savings shown 
over more than 120,000 installations globally.
