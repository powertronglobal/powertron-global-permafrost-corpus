HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report

Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study

The purpose of this study is to verify the industry wide problem of efficiency loss in HVAC/R as projected by

ASHRAE research and to quantify the amount of money wasted due to this loss. Many industry leading

organizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age.

Thermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVACR equipment that operates as a

vapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well

documented by the HVACR industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal degradation

prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times and

additional kWh consumption.

The chiller in this study is representative of the portfolio of comfort cooling equipment operated by Major NYC University

College and the CUNY (City University of New York) system. If thermal degradation is present in this chiller it

is present in the entire inventory of equipment. Energy waste can be calculated based on this equipment

(portfolio representation) and then accurately extrapolated across the entire inventory of equipment.

Similarly, if the lost efficiency of this chiller can be

restored, it would allow Major NYC University and CUNY to

keep it in service longer without sacrificing

performance or energy consumption. It will also

provide Major NYC University and CUNY the flexibility of a

much wider window of time wherein to undertake

the costly capital expense of replacing it when it

does finally reach the end of its useful life.

Process

This report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of one of two main chillers

that support the main Major NYC University College facility in New York.

Detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the pilot chiller before and after

the installation of the ECM to determine the impact on the three key elements that greatly affect Major NYC University’s

HVAC power bill as they relate to the original design specifications:

1.  The cooling capacity the chiller is capable of producing after 22 years in service.

2.  The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the chiller is delivering as

reflected in the kW/ton measurement.

3.  The thermal dynamic ability of the chiller to still perform at or close to operational design.

Methodology

The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the

IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team was led by Powertron Global

Global’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer] and witnessed by Major NYC University College’s Stationary Engineer,

[Client Representative]. The overall project was managed and directed by [Director Physical Plant Operations], Director of Physical Plant

Operations for Major NYC University College.

Engineering Notes

The chiller was tested over the span of nearly twelve months. During the trial the chiller experienced some issues with its air

purging system, but once corrected this minor problem did not affect the ultimate results of the PermaFrost NMR® testing.

Both the baseline and post measurement s were taken with outside air temperatures of 82 degrees and sunshine.  These

similar temperatures as well as only slight difference in incoming condenser water from the tower are both within the

industry-accepted margin of error and thereby considered insignificant in terms of overall results.

Major NYC University’s management of the chiller plant combined with the building load during the trial provided more than an

adequate heat load on the facility to ensure the chiller would remain running during the actual data collection period.

The boundary of the testing was the chiller and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance

calculations is very high.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)

The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the pilot chiller to perform prior to

PermaFrost NMR® (ECM) being installed, as well as illustrate the amount of thermal degradation due in large

part to thermal degradation within the heat exchangers (evaporator and condenser barrels).

The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan.

The results were formulated by entering the data into the following applicable thermodynamic

engineering formulas:

• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase)

• Ton = (Airflow * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta) / 12,000

• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage

• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)

• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU

• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Water Temp – Saturated Evaporator Temp (CH)

Notes

Following a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to determine the operational condition of the systems was

satisfactory, Baseline M&V data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. One year after installation of PermaFrost

NMR®, the M&V team returned on a very similar weather day to the Baseline to take Post M&V measurements in the

identical fashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements and associated calculations show the amount of

capacity restored.

The following baseline IPMVP data points were recorded on 25 June 2013 using recently calibrated devices by NIST

(National Institutes of Standards and Technology) to insure measurement accuracy. The chiller was then treated with

PermaFrost NMR® on the same day and allowed to run normally until 5 June 2014 to ensure the patented surface

science nanotechnology had ample time to seat into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All measurements were

taken at 90% load and at similar outdoor air temperatures.

The collection of the data in both the baseline and post periods was collected by Powertron Global® and witnessed by

Major NYC University’s Stationary Engineer. Photographic evidence of the measurements is available upon request. The measurements

are listed below.

Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results

Chiller Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM

Major NYC University College and CUNY have the problem of thermal degradation in its HVAC/R units. The lower baseline

operating tonnage and COP ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost

to operate numbers. The degraded equipment performance was costing Major NYC University College significant money and

wasting energy. The equipment was using significantly more kWh to operate than it used when it was new.

The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the chiller in the baseline and post

testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation.

The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 101.7 operating tons and an

improvement of 17.7% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the

chiller throughout the year.

The York chiller treated has a nominal capacity of 675 tons at 90% load and 1,500 gallons per minute (GPM) flow

through the evaporator.  The chiller used in this pilot was tested at 90% load but with a GPM flow much higher

than design. Since normal operations were not to be changed for the pilot (i.e., adjusting the water flow through

both the evaporator and condensing barrels), the emphasis here is on the delta between baseline and post.

Recovered Wasted Energy with PermaFrost NMR® -  Chiller

The chart to the right illustrates the performance

restoration PermaFrost NMR® created in the treated

chiller. The average cost to operate this chiller before it

was treated, as calculated in kW/ton, was .616.

The specific cost to operate this chiller after it was

treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in

kW/ton, is currently .524.

The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ

was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of

performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate

for a 22 year old chiller. The post results are also in

line with the average improvement savings shown

over more than 120,000 installations globally.

Return On Investment

The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR®

Post measurement period for the Major NYC University College Chiller.

Baseline Energy Consumption

Baseline Tonnage: 559.4 tons

Adjusted kW Baseline: .616 kW/ton * 661.1 tons = 407.24 kW

Adjusted Baseline kWh: 407.24 kW * 4,200 Annual Operating Hrs = 1,710,408 kWh

Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 1,710,408 kWh * $.16 = $273,665

Post Energy Consumption

kW Post: .524 kW/ton * 661.1 tons = 346.42 kW

Annual kWh Post: 346.42 kW * 4,200 hours = 1,454,964 kWh

Annual Cost Post: 1,454,964 kWh * .16 cents = $232,794

Savings Per Year

Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $273,665 - $232,794 = $40,871

Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $40,871 / 12 = $3,406

Return On Investment

Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot chiller: $24,000

Estimated ROI Period for Chiller: $24,000 / $3,406 = 7 months

Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for

Major NYC University College for implementing the PermaFrost NMR®, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true

energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in

the Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems was when operating at the

original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the

revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® was installed. This regression

analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the systems will now operate

due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the internal building set points with

increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
