Many industry leading \norganizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age. \nThermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVACR equipment that operates as a \nvapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well \ndocumented by the HVACR industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal degradation \nprevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times and \nadditional kWh consumption.\nThe chiller in this study is representative of the portfolio of comfort cooling equipment operated by Major NYC University \nCollege and the CUNY (City University of New York) system. If thermal degradation is present in this chiller it \nis present in the entire inventory of equipment. Energy waste can be calculated based on this equipment \n(portfolio representation) and then accurately extrapolated across the entire inventory of equipment. \nSimilarly, if the lost efficiency of this chiller can be \nrestored, it would allow Major NYC University and CUNY to \nkeep it in service longer without sacrificing \nperformance or energy consumption. It will also \nprovide Major NYC University and CUNY the flexibility of a \nmuch wider window of time wherein to undertake \nthe costly capital expense of replacing it when it \ndoes finally reach the end of its useful life.   \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 605, "chars": 2901, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_022_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:a8a88ce59a11b28dcf1afc2b653ede9cf4327a64ca17d7319fc2f157c8ebfc14"}

The cooling capacity the chiller is capable of producing after 22 years in service. \n \n2.  The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the chiller is delivering as \n \n     reflected in the kW/ton measurement. \n \n3.  The thermal dynamic ability of the chiller to still perform at or close to operational design.\nMethodology\nThe measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the \nIPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team was led by Powertron \nGlobal’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer] and witnessed by Major NYC University College’s Stationary Engineer, \n[Client Representative]. The overall project was managed and directed by [Director Physical Plant Operations], Director of Physical Plant \nOperations for Major NYC University College.  \nEngineering Notes \nThe chiller was tested over the span of nearly twelve months. During the trial the chiller experienced some issues with its air \npurging system, but once corrected this minor problem did not affect the ultimate results of the PermaFrost NMR® testing.  \nBoth the baseline and post measurement s were taken with outside air temperatures of 82 degrees and sunshine.  These \nsimilar temperatures as well as only slight difference in incoming condenser water from the tower are both within the \nindustry-accepted margin of error and thereby considered insignificant in terms of overall results.  \nMajor NYC University’s management of the chiller plant combined with the building load during the trial provided more than an \nadequate heat load on the facility to ensure the chiller would remain running during the actual data collection period. \nThe boundary of the testing was the chiller and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance \ncalculations is very high.\n \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 585, "chars": 2992, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_022_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_022_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:d4159b29a31ab20da02cd5c4bcdabe7552a02c064786166c0214c59447d51a7e"}

One year after installation of PermaFrost \nNMR®, the M&V team returned on a very similar weather day to the Baseline to take Post M&V measurements in the \nidentical fashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements and associated calculations show the amount of \ncapacity restored.\nThe following baseline IPMVP data points were recorded on 25 June 2013 using recently calibrated devices by NIST \n(National Institutes of Standards and Technology) to insure measurement accuracy. The chiller was then treated with \nPermaFrost NMR® on the same day and allowed to run normally until 5 June 2014 to ensure the patented surface \nscience nanotechnology had ample time to seat into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All measurements were \ntaken at 90% load and at similar outdoor air temperatures. \nThe collection of the data in both the baseline and post periods was collected by Powertron Global® and witnessed by \nMajor NYC University’s Stationary Engineer.

The lower baseline \noperating tonnage and COP ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost \nto operate numbers. The degraded equipment performance was costing Major NYC University College significant money and \nwasting energy. The equipment was using significantly more kWh to operate than it used when it was new. \nThe performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the chiller in the baseline and post \ntesting periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. \nThe implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 101.7 operating tons and an \nimprovement of 17.7% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the \nchiller throughout the year.\nThe York chiller treated has a nominal capacity of 675 tons at 90% load and 1,500 gallons per minute (GPM) flow \nthrough the evaporator.  The chiller used in this pilot was tested at 90% load but with a GPM flow much higher \nthan design. Since normal operations were not to be changed for the pilot (i.e., adjusting the water flow through \nboth the evaporator and condensing barrels), the emphasis here is on the delta between baseline and post.  \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 685, "chars": 2744, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_022_chunk_0003", "next_id": "pdf_022_chunk_0005", "content_hash": "sha256:35a693f1a98f5b2660954b41243964dfa431c4f726f0577109e4298e47404d37"}
