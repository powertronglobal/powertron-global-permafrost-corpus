Financial: Price, ROI, Payment Options 
 
 
Product Price 
 
Product pricing is standard and by the ounce. PermaFrost NMR® is $125 per 
ounce. In direct exchange or DX units require 1 ounce per ton of capacity. 
Chillers require treatment to be proportional to 10% of the oil capacity. 
Volume discounts are available for enterprise-wide deployments.  
Prices do not include cost of installation (Installation Fact Sheet link) 
Return on Investment (ROI) 
 
Restoring cooling capacity is just sound business. Multiple corporate 
objectives are advanced simultaneously – operational uptime, better working 
conditions and reduction of carbon footprint. Most compelling is ROI.  
HVAC intensity, age of equipment and kWh price vary widely. Typically, 
customers see a positive financial return from energy savings in 14 months-2 
years. HVAC-intense environments, e.g., data centers, labs, manufacturing, and 
businesses in high tariff areas, can see full payback within a few months. When 
total financial return includes lifetime ROI, 20% extended equipment life, 
fewer machine repairs and less downtime, few investments are as strategic or 
more attractive.

• Active optimization of new capacity can substantially increase return 
• Improved EER and kW/ton reduces demand surcharges for peak usage 
• ROI greatest on new machines where degradation costs are totally 
avoided 
• Volume discount pricing available for >10k ounce orders 
• Monthly installment payments over ROI cycle time 
• Meets GAAP accounting criteria for capital expense 
• If qualified based on HVAC-intensity, no cost saving sharing plans 
available 
Payment Options 
 
No cost, shared savings:  Powertron Global provides flexible payment 
arrangements. No upfront outlay is required in most deployment situations. If 
a customer requires confirmatory testing, some initial charges may apply but 
would be recouped upon deployment. 
  
• Full payment for product is expected within 90 days of a completed 
deployment unless other arrangements are made. 
 
• Payments can be made on a Monthly Installment Plan that syncs-up with 
a customer’s initial payback period, typically 12-24 installments. 
 
• Enterprises with campus-like facilities serviced by large chiller plants 
controlled by Building Management Systems may qualify for no cost, 
savings sharing plans. Typically, these 50/50 sharing arrangements last 
for a set contract period, e.g., 4 years. Thereafter the customer keeps all 
generated savings. To learn more about our ThEOS Program (click here) 
 
• For customers committed to allocating spend with minority suppliers, 
Powertron’s MBE/WBE partner Argent Associates can manage the 
entire transaction from purchasing through deployment (MBE Fact 
Sheet link)
