Payment Options 
 
No cost, shared savings:  Powertron Global provides flexible payment 
arrangements. No upfront outlay is required in most deployment situations. If 
a customer requires confirmatory testing, some initial charges may apply but 
would be recouped upon deployment. 
  
• Full payment for product is expected within 90 days of a completed 
deployment unless other arrangements are made. 
 
• Payments can be made on a Monthly Installment Plan that syncs-up with 
a customer’s initial payback period, typically 12-24 installments. 
 
• Enterprises with campus-like facilities serviced by large chiller plants 
controlled by Building Management Systems may qualify for no cost, 
savings sharing plans. Typically, these 50/50 sharing arrangements last 
for a set contract period, e.g., 4 years. Thereafter the customer keeps all 
generated savings. To learn more about our ThEOS Program (click here) 
 
• For customers committed to allocating spend with minority suppliers, 
Powertron’s MBE/WBE partner Argent Associates can manage the 
entire transaction from purchasing through deployment (MBE Fact
