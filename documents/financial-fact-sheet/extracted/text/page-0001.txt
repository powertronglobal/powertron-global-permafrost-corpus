Financial: Price, ROI, Payment Options 
 
 
Product Price 
 
Product pricing is standard and by the ounce. PermaFrost NMR® is $125 per 
ounce. In direct exchange or DX units require 1 ounce per ton of capacity. 
Chillers require treatment to be proportional to 10% of the oil capacity. 
Volume discounts are available for enterprise-wide deployments.  
Prices do not include cost of installation (Installation Fact Sheet link) 
Return on Investment (ROI) 
 
Restoring cooling capacity is just sound business. Multiple corporate 
objectives are advanced simultaneously – operational uptime, better working 
conditions and reduction of carbon footprint. Most compelling is ROI.  
HVAC intensity, age of equipment and kWh price vary widely. Typically, 
customers see a positive financial return from energy savings in 14 months-2 
years. HVAC-intense environments, e.g., data centers, labs, manufacturing, and 
businesses in high tariff areas, can see full payback within a few months. When 
total financial return includes lifetime ROI, 20% extended equipment life, 
fewer machine repairs and less downtime, few investments are as strategic or 
more attractive.
