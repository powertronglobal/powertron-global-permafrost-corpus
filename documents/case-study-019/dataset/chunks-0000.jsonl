Working together, the ECMs will beneﬁt Regional Telecom in any or all of the following ways:\n \n• Restore capacity of the CRAC systems to satisfy ﬂuctuating building loads or lower room temps\n \n• Produce additional CRAC system redundancy at no extra cost or interruption to operations\n \n \n• Improve CRAC system efﬁciency, lowering cost to produce each ton of cooling required\n \n \n• Restoring thermal efﬁciency, allowing CRAC systems to achieve thermostat set points faster\n \n \n• Improve CRAC system performance, reducing runtime and extending equipment life by 15%+ \n \n \n• Reduce amp draw and peak demand charges (KVA) while increasing Power Factor utilization\n \n \n• Produce cooler operating temperatures of compressors, reducing service calls \nThe improvements demonstrated in this or any ﬁeld test resulting from PermaFrost NMR® and Circuit Master are \ndependent on factors such as age, condition, service history, runtime of one or both compressors and the design \nand application of each system. The results in this pilot were very consistent with 10+ year historical performance \naverages as well as the recent laboratory study completed in May, 2015 on DX equipment by Underwriters \nLaboratories (UL) in their testing chambers in [Texas Location], TX.\nSetting the Stage for the Study\nThe location chosen for this pilot is a small data center that is supported mainly by the two pilot CRAC systems as \nwell as a smaller cooling system in a separate room off the main ﬂoor. The conﬁguration of this facility puts the \nmajor load on CRAC system #2 which encompasses the bulk of the servers and the Network Operations Center \n(NOC). CRAC system #1 supports a less densely populated area of the main ﬂoor. At the start of the pilot, both \nCRAC systems were set on 68 degrees. A temperature and humidity logger was placed in the center of the main \nﬂoor to monitor the room temperature. At the start of the pilot the average temperature in the data center was \n74.85 degrees and the humidity averaged 32%.", "tokens": 796, "chars": 3604, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_027_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:6bde0a66d7e987a8e9ade77ab538a409954c4a302940cf4866e983e590ebe497"}

Four weeks after \n \n   installation, the cooling capacity was restored by 6.77 tons or 19.5% to 41.42 tons. \n \n• The overall cost to produce each ton of cooling on the pilot systems dropped 31.8% from 1.57 kW/ton in \n \n   the baseline to 1.07 kW/ton four weeks after installation of the two ECMs. This means that for every ton \n \n   of cooling the two pilot CRAC systems are asked to produce, Regional Telecom is spending 31.8% less to do so.\n \n• The projected annual kWh’s were reduced by 31.8% from 398,634 to 271,682.\n \n• The conditions inside the data center dropped  from 74.85 degrees and 32% humidity to 73.25  \n \n   degrees and 28% humidity. When properly set up to accommodate the load, this increase in capacity \n \n   will enable the main CRAC system to begin to cycle which will save even more energy annually.\n \n• The average kW dropped 18.7% from 51.1 in the baseline to 41.52 in the post when comparing \n \n   multiple hour-long blocks of time under similar outdoor air temperatures affecting the condensing \n \n   units. The true effect of these savings over time are further explained in the regression analysis.\n \n• The power factor was increased in the pilot CRAC systems by 14% from .787 to .915. \n3\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website.", "tokens": 790, "chars": 3256, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_027_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_027_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:f3feeec1e9cf9b99341d3960204f14e673475bb01db98b5b6665cc00596f3c34"}

They included: \n \n1. Determine that the “as-is” capacity and efﬁciency of the pilot CRAC systems supporting the \n \n    Regional Telecom complex had degraded by at least 10% after 14 years in operation.  \n \n2. Demonstrate at least 15% performance improvement in tonnage and/or corresponding kW/ton and \n \n    energy reduction in the pilot CRAC cooling systems four weeks after PermaFrost NMR® and the Circuit \n \n    Master® devices were installed. \n \n3. Demonstrate the ability of the CRAC pilot systems to produce cooler, drier air as measured in both Dry \n \n    Bulb and Wet Bulb deltas after being treated.  \n \n4. To support an effective business case for further deployments of the ECMs within the Regional Telecom \n \n    portfolio of properties, demonstrate ﬁnancial beneﬁts associated with efﬁciency improvements \n \n    realized over the duration of the study. These beneﬁts must be equivalent to a 24-month or less \n \n    payback to Regional Telecom on their initial project costs.\nECM Product Briefs\nPermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented surface science nanotechnology that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative \n(NMR®) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost \nNMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type of climate control system in which it is installed.  The direct beneﬁts \nof PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling efﬁciency and increased capacity. \n \nCircuit Master® is a product that blocks distortions in electrical power above and below the normal signal range \nand contains line ﬁlter capacitors to improve power factor. This allows induction power equipment such as HVAC, \nrefrigeration, motors and pumps to use less energy.  Equipment lifespan is also increased and maintenance costs \nare reduced. This equipment is installed at the electrical disconnect for each machine or at each compressor in a \ndual-circuit HVAC unit where both compressors run an extensive amount of time annually.\n  \n4\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 739, "chars": 3200, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_027_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_027_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:3b7244a13dbe9cf24d46af91cbb79862ed770e72bdb4f42847565f3a8fa0ff6b"}

It is the HVAC industry’s standard of \ndetermining how much energy is required to create a \nsingle ton of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you \nreduce your unit cost of cooling you are saving energy \nregardless of how much overall cooling you require.\nThe chart to the right clearly illustrates the amount of \nefﬁciency restoration the ECM created in the pilot \nsystems just 4 weeks after treatment. The two treated \npilot CRAC systems are now performing 31.8% more \nefﬁciently than before being treated. This degradation in \noperational efﬁciency was costing Regional Telecom a \nsubstantial amount of money in wasted energy.  \n5\nkW/ton\nPilot Unit Performance Efﬁciency\n4 Wks after Treatment\nBaseline\nPost\n1.57\n1.07\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 595, "chars": 2365, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_027_chunk_0003", "next_id": "pdf_027_chunk_0005", "content_hash": "sha256:ada24f305a0af8493eb6cb3b18408e3dd91873b6a63e4e669f1d76cc695c5aed"}

Working together, these improvements reduce the annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The \nROI comes from determining what the cost to run the cooling systems was when operating at the original energy \nproﬁle to produce the newly restored amount of available capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run \nthe cooling systems at the same restored capacity after the PermaFrost NMR® and Circuit Master ECMs were \ninstalled. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of \nhours and/or load % at which the systems will now operate due to the restored performance proﬁle. This restored \nperformance proﬁle allows the cooling systems to satisfy the internal area set points with increased efﬁciency \nresulting in reduced compressor demand loading.  \n13\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\nCertiﬁcation\n[Engineering Consultant], P.E., for EET reviewed the testing and data collection methodology used in this pilot and \nattests to the integrity and accuracy of the data pre and post PermaFrost NMR® treatment.\nPlace P.E.
