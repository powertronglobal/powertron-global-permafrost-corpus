Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the ﬁnal calculated average performance measurements before and after the two ECM’s were 
installed on the two pilot CRAC systems. 
Average Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Capacity:  34.65 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline:  1.57 kW/ton * 41.42 tons = 65.03 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh:  65.03 kW * 6,130 Annual Operating Hours = 398,634 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 398,634 kWh * $.102 = $40,661
Average Post Energy Consumption
kW Post:  1.07 kW/ton * 41.42 tons = 44.32 kW
Annual kWh Post:  44.32 kW * 6,130 hours = 271,682 kWh
Annual Cost Post:  271,682 kWh * $.102 cents = $27,712
Average Savings Per Year Per Unit
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year:  $40,661 - $27,712 = $12,949
Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $12,949 / 12 = $1,079
Return on Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® and Circuit Master devices installed in the pilot cooling systems: $12,393
Estimated ROI for Regional Telecom when treating the pilot cooling systems: $12,393 / $1,079 = ~11.5 mos
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 104%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 522%
Explanation of Regression Analysis
To obtain a avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Regional Telecom for implementing both the 
PermaFrost NMR® and Circuit Master ECMs, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in both capacity and efﬁciency utilizing data collected during the pilot 
study. Working together, these improvements reduce the annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The 
ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the cooling systems was when operating at the original energy 
proﬁle to produce the newly restored amount of available capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run 
the cooling systems at the same restored capacity after the PermaFrost NMR® and Circuit Master ECMs were 
installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of 
hours and/or load % at which the systems will now operate due to the restored performance proﬁle. This restored 
performance proﬁle allows the cooling systems to satisfy the internal area set points with increased efﬁciency 
resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
