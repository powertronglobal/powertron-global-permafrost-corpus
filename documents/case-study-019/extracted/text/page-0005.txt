Methodology
After verifying the amount of air ﬂowing across the evaporator coils before beginning each pilot, the subsequent 
measurements used in the efﬁciency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with Option B of 
the IPMVP (International Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol) framework. 
The results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic 
engineering formulas:
- 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor * Sq Rt 3  /1000 (for 3-Phase) 
- 
• kW/ton = Actual Measured Energy / Actual Measured Capacity 
- 
• Coefﬁcient of Performance (COP) = 12 / (kW/ton) /3.412
- 
• Actual Cooling Capacity per Hour = (Measured CFM * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta T) / 12,000 BTU
Improved Unit Cost
The “Unit Cost” in the HVAC industry is the kW/ton ratio. 
KW/ton is commonly used for larger commercial and 
industrial air conditioning, heat pump and refrigeration 
systems. It is the HVAC industry’s standard of 
determining how much energy is required to create a 
single ton of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you 
reduce your unit cost of cooling you are saving energy 
regardless of how much overall cooling you require.
The chart to the right clearly illustrates the amount of 
efﬁciency restoration the ECM created in the pilot 
systems just 4 weeks after treatment. The two treated 
pilot CRAC systems are now performing 31.8% more 
efﬁciently than before being treated. This degradation in 
operational efﬁciency was costing Regional Telecom a 
substantial amount of money in wasted energy.
