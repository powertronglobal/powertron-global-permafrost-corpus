Highlights of the Study
When comparing the two CRAC pilot systems before and four weeks after PermaFrost NMR® and Circuit Masters 
were installed, below are some of the highlights of the study:
 
• When initially tested, the pilot CRAC systems were producing 34.65 tons of cooling. Four weeks after 
 
   installation, the cooling capacity was restored by 6.77 tons or 19.5% to 41.42 tons. 
 
• The overall cost to produce each ton of cooling on the pilot systems dropped 31.8% from 1.57 kW/ton in 
 
   the baseline to 1.07 kW/ton four weeks after installation of the two ECMs. This means that for every ton 
 
   of cooling the two pilot CRAC systems are asked to produce, Regional Telecom is spending 31.8% less to do so.
 
• The projected annual kWh’s were reduced by 31.8% from 398,634 to 271,682.
 
• The conditions inside the data center dropped  from 74.85 degrees and 32% humidity to 73.25  
 
   degrees and 28% humidity. When properly set up to accommodate the load, this increase in capacity 
 
   will enable the main CRAC system to begin to cycle which will save even more energy annually.
 
• The average kW dropped 18.7% from 51.1 in the baseline to 41.52 in the post when comparing 
 
   multiple hour-long blocks of time under similar outdoor air temperatures affecting the condensing 
 
   units. The true effect of these savings over time are further explained in the regression analysis.
 
• The power factor was increased in the pilot CRAC systems by 14% from .787 to .915.
