Study Overview

This report details the results of the recently completed comprehensive energy performance study conducted at

the Regional Telecom Headquarters in Show Low, AZ.

Running from August 21 to October 15, 2015, the pilot was designed to illustrate the positive impact the

PermaFrost NMR® and Circuit Master (CM) energy control measures (ECMs) would have on the overall cooling

and energy performance of data center Computer Room Air Conditioning (CRAC) systems.

As demonstrated in this ﬁeld trial, PermaFrost NMR® restores the cooling capacity on the CRAC systems lost over

time due to thermal degradation of the heat exchange surfaces, while the CM devices treat the power supplying

the systems. Working together, the ECMs will beneﬁt Regional Telecom in any or all of the following ways:

• Restore capacity of the CRAC systems to satisfy ﬂuctuating building loads or lower room temps

• Produce additional CRAC system redundancy at no extra cost or interruption to operations

• Improve CRAC system efﬁciency, lowering cost to produce each ton of cooling required

• Restoring thermal efﬁciency, allowing CRAC systems to achieve thermostat set points faster

• Improve CRAC system performance, reducing runtime and extending equipment life by 15%+

• Reduce amp draw and peak demand charges (KVA) while increasing Power Factor utilization

• Produce cooler operating temperatures of compressors, reducing service calls

The improvements demonstrated in this or any ﬁeld test resulting from PermaFrost NMR® and Circuit Master are

dependent on factors such as age, condition, service history, runtime of one or both compressors and the design

and application of each system. The results in this pilot were very consistent with 10+ year historical performance

averages as well as the recent laboratory study completed in May, 2015 on DX equipment by Underwriters

Laboratories (UL) in their testing chambers in [Texas Location], TX.

Setting the Stage for the Study

The location chosen for this pilot is a small data center that is supported mainly by the two pilot CRAC systems as

well as a smaller cooling system in a separate room off the main ﬂoor. The conﬁguration of this facility puts the

major load on CRAC system #2 which encompasses the bulk of the servers and the Network Operations Center

(NOC). CRAC system #1 supports a less densely populated area of the main ﬂoor. At the start of the pilot, both

CRAC systems were set on 68 degrees. A temperature and humidity logger was placed in the center of the main

ﬂoor to monitor the room temperature. At the start of the pilot the average temperature in the data center was

74.85 degrees and the humidity averaged 32%. CRAC system #1 was able to satisfy its set point and cycle off

occasionally while CRAC system #2 could never satisfy set point and thus never shut off.

17.1%

Highlights of the Study

When comparing the two CRAC pilot systems before and four weeks after PermaFrost NMR® and Circuit Masters

were installed, below are some of the highlights of the study:

• When initially tested, the pilot CRAC systems were producing 34.65 tons of cooling. Four weeks after

installation, the cooling capacity was restored by 6.77 tons or 19.5% to 41.42 tons.

• The overall cost to produce each ton of cooling on the pilot systems dropped 31.8% from 1.57 kW/ton in

the baseline to 1.07 kW/ton four weeks after installation of the two ECMs. This means that for every ton

of cooling the two pilot CRAC systems are asked to produce, Regional Telecom is spending 31.8% less to do so.

• The projected annual kWh’s were reduced by 31.8% from 398,634 to 271,682.

• The conditions inside the data center dropped  from 74.85 degrees and 32% humidity to 73.25

degrees and 28% humidity. When properly set up to accommodate the load, this increase in capacity

will enable the main CRAC system to begin to cycle which will save even more energy annually.

• The average kW dropped 18.7% from 51.1 in the baseline to 41.52 in the post when comparing

multiple hour-long blocks of time under similar outdoor air temperatures affecting the condensing

units. The true effect of these savings over time are further explained in the regression analysis.

• The power factor was increased in the pilot CRAC systems by 14% from .787 to .915.

Objectives

The four key objectives for this jointly-conducted PermaFrost NMR® pilot study between EET, Powertron Global

and Regional Telecom were all achieved.  They included:

1. Determine that the “as-is” capacity and efﬁciency of the pilot CRAC systems supporting the

Regional Telecom complex had degraded by at least 10% after 14 years in operation.

2. Demonstrate at least 15% performance improvement in tonnage and/or corresponding kW/ton and

energy reduction in the pilot CRAC cooling systems four weeks after PermaFrost NMR® and the Circuit

Master® devices were installed.

3. Demonstrate the ability of the CRAC pilot systems to produce cooler, drier air as measured in both Dry

Bulb and Wet Bulb deltas after being treated.

4. To support an effective business case for further deployments of the ECMs within the Regional Telecom

portfolio of properties, demonstrate ﬁnancial beneﬁts associated with efﬁciency improvements

realized over the duration of the study. These beneﬁts must be equivalent to a 24-month or less

payback to Regional Telecom on their initial project costs.

ECM Product Briefs

PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented surface science nanotechnology that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative

(NMR®) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost

NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type of climate control system in which it is installed.  The direct beneﬁts

of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling efﬁciency and increased capacity.

Circuit Master® is a product that blocks distortions in electrical power above and below the normal signal range

and contains line ﬁlter capacitors to improve power factor. This allows induction power equipment such as HVAC,

refrigeration, motors and pumps to use less energy.  Equipment lifespan is also increased and maintenance costs

are reduced. This equipment is installed at the electrical disconnect for each machine or at each compressor in a

dual-circuit HVAC unit where both compressors run an extensive amount of time annually.

Methodology

After verifying the amount of air ﬂowing across the evaporator coils before beginning each pilot, the subsequent

measurements used in the efﬁciency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with Option B of

the IPMVP (International Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol) framework.

The results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic

engineering formulas:

- 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor * Sq Rt 3  /1000 (for 3-Phase)

- 
• kW/ton = Actual Measured Energy / Actual Measured Capacity

- 
• Coefﬁcient of Performance (COP) = 12 / (kW/ton) /3.412

- 
• Actual Cooling Capacity per Hour = (Measured CFM * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta T) / 12,000 BTU

Improved Unit Cost

The “Unit Cost” in the HVAC industry is the kW/ton ratio.

KW/ton is commonly used for larger commercial and

industrial air conditioning, heat pump and refrigeration

systems. It is the HVAC industry’s standard of

determining how much energy is required to create a

single ton of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you

reduce your unit cost of cooling you are saving energy

regardless of how much overall cooling you require.

The chart to the right clearly illustrates the amount of

efﬁciency restoration the ECM created in the pilot

systems just 4 weeks after treatment. The two treated

pilot CRAC systems are now performing 31.8% more

efﬁciently than before being treated. This degradation in

operational efﬁciency was costing Regional Telecom a

substantial amount of money in wasted energy.

Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics

The following are the ﬁnal calculated average performance measurements before and after the two ECM’s were

installed on the two pilot CRAC systems.

Average Baseline Energy Consumption

Baseline Capacity:  34.65 tons

Adjusted kW Baseline:  1.57 kW/ton * 41.42 tons = 65.03 kW

Adjusted Baseline kWh:  65.03 kW * 6,130 Annual Operating Hours = 398,634 kWh

Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 398,634 kWh * $.102 = $40,661

Average Post Energy Consumption

kW Post:  1.07 kW/ton * 41.42 tons = 44.32 kW

Annual kWh Post:  44.32 kW * 6,130 hours = 271,682 kWh

Annual Cost Post:  271,682 kWh * $.102 cents = $27,712

Average Savings Per Year Per Unit

Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year:  $40,661 - $27,712 = $12,949

Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $12,949 / 12 = $1,079

Return on Investment

Cost of PermaFrost NMR® and Circuit Master devices installed in the pilot cooling systems: $12,393

Estimated ROI for Regional Telecom when treating the pilot cooling systems: $12,393 / $1,079 = ~11.5 mos

Annual Internal Rate of Return = 104%

Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 522%

Explanation of Regression Analysis

To obtain a avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Regional Telecom for implementing both the

PermaFrost NMR® and Circuit Master ECMs, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy

savings resulting from the improvement in both capacity and efﬁciency utilizing data collected during the pilot

study. Working together, these improvements reduce the annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The

ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the cooling systems was when operating at the original energy

proﬁle to produce the newly restored amount of available capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run

the cooling systems at the same restored capacity after the PermaFrost NMR® and Circuit Master ECMs were

installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of

hours and/or load % at which the systems will now operate due to the restored performance proﬁle. This restored

performance proﬁle allows the cooling systems to satisfy the internal area set points with increased efﬁciency

resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
