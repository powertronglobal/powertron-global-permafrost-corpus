PermaFrost NMR lasts \nfor the remaining useful service life of any HVAC unit that it is administered \nto due to nanotechnology’s ability to embed itself into the internal metal \nsurfaces of a closed refrigeration circuit to restore the heat transfer \nproperties of the metal.  \n \nIt was determined to select eight (8) of the original ten (10) sites selected due \nto two (2) of the ten (10) sites from last year experiencing mechanical issues \n(not due to PF NMR) during the post data collection period. Those issues are \nwell documented in the initial post review report of 2023 provided to Major US Telecom. \nPlease see last year’s confirmatory test of 2023 for details.

These are the \nsame make and model of devices and sensors that were implemented in \n2023. \n \nPowertron Global was tasked by Major US Telecom to compare twenty (20) days of \nbaseline (II) from 2023, which differed from the original baseline due to the \nstandard of matching heat loads/CDDs to newly captured post (II) data \ncollection 2024 – 1 year later. Powertron Global was careful in choosing the \ntwenty (20) day selections for each treated unit as to match the outdoor air \ntemperature or external heat load to normalize the data sets. Each unit’s data \nset was customized to match exactly or with a variance in CDDs of only 1% or \nless (.07% on average). This variance is considered insignificant between \ndata sets giving confidence in the data. This exact methodology was \nimplemented the year prior.
