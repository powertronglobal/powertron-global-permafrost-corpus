Methodology 
 
Powertron Global attached one F2 (IoT Measurement & Verification) device 
per site that included two (2) revenue grade power meters (one for each Bard 
unit), an outdoor air temperature sensor and a dry contact on each of the 
treated sixteen (16) Bard units (compressor on/off sensor). These are the 
same make and model of devices and sensors that were implemented in 
2023. 
 
Powertron Global was tasked by Major US Telecom to compare twenty (20) days of 
baseline (II) from 2023, which differed from the original baseline due to the 
standard of matching heat loads/CDDs to newly captured post (II) data 
collection 2024 – 1 year later. Powertron Global was careful in choosing the 
twenty (20) day selections for each treated unit as to match the outdoor air 
temperature or external heat load to normalize the data sets. Each unit’s data 
set was customized to match exactly or with a variance in CDDs of only 1% or 
less (.07% on average). This variance is considered insignificant between 
data sets giving confidence in the data. This exact methodology was 
implemented the year prior. Please see CDD table contained in this report. 
 
All detailed per node/HVAC unit data sets with exact dates, pre and post, are 
found in the accompanying spreadsheet provided to Major US Telecom along with all raw 
data files.
