Major US Telecom Cell Hut Tower 1-Year Review - Baseline II vs Post II 
(2023 vs 2024) 
 
 
 
Introduction 
 
The purpose of this report is to demonstrate PermaFrost NMR (PF NMR) 
results are ongoing in previously treated HVAC equipment and that the 
technology meets it’s claims of being a permanent, one time application. 
Major US Telecom requested Powertron Global make a return trip to [Texas City] to 
capture a second round of post power consumption (kWh) & temperature 
(CDD) data from the treated cell tower sites in 2023. PermaFrost NMR lasts 
for the remaining useful service life of any HVAC unit that it is administered 
to due to nanotechnology’s ability to embed itself into the internal metal 
surfaces of a closed refrigeration circuit to restore the heat transfer 
properties of the metal.  
 
It was determined to select eight (8) of the original ten (10) sites selected due 
to two (2) of the ten (10) sites from last year experiencing mechanical issues 
(not due to PF NMR) during the post data collection period. Those issues are 
well documented in the initial post review report of 2023 provided to Major US Telecom. 
Please see last year’s confirmatory test of 2023 for details. The eight (8) sites 
are:
