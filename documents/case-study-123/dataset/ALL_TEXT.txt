HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report
Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study
The purpose of this study is to verify the industry wide problem of efficiency loss in HVAC/R as projected by 
ASHRAE research and to quantify the amount of money wasted due to this loss. Many industry leading 
organizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age. 
Thermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVACR equipment that operates as a 
vapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well 
documented by the HVACR industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal degradation 
prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times and additional 
kWh consumption.
The CRAC unit in this study is representative of a 
great majority of the portfolio of equipment 
operated by Telecom Provider Communications. If thermal 
degradation is present in this CRAC unit, it is 
present in the entire inventory of equipment. 
Energy waste can be calculated based on this unit 
(portfolio representation) and then accurately 
extrapolated across the entire inventory of 
equipment.

Process
This report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of one of five of CRAC 
units that support the Telecom Provider Communications facility in Allentown, PA. 
Detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the pilot CRAC unit before and 
after the installation of PermaFrost NMR® to determine the impact on the three key elements that greatly 
affect Telecom Provider’s HVAC power bill as they relate to the original design specifications:
 
 
1.  The cooling capacity the CRAC unit is capable of producing after 16 years in service.
 
2.  The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the CRAC unit is 
 
     delivering as reflected in the kW/ton measurement. 
 
3.  The thermal dynamic ability of the CRAC unit to still perform at or close to operational design.
Methodology
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the 
IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted of Telecom Provider’s Facility 
Engineering Manager, [Client Representative] and Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer].  
Notes 
Since the post measurements were taken with outside air temperatures of 4 degrees cooler than in the baseline, actual amp 
readings taken in the post were raised to normalize for the very slight affect the weather had on the condensing unit’s 
ability to dissipate heat.  
Telecom Provider’s management of the data center and the internal load during the trial provided more than an adequate heat load on 
the pilot CRAC unit to ensure it would remain running during the actual data collection period. 
The boundary of the testing was the CRAC unit and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance 
calculations is very high.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the pilot CRAC unit to perform prior to 
and following PermaFrost NMR® (ECM) being installed. The report will also illustrate the amount of thermal 
degradation that has occurred due in large part to thermal degradation within the heat exchangers and how much of 
that has been restored.
 
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• Tons = (Airflow * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta) / 12,000 
 
• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
 
• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Air Temp – Saturated Suction Temp 
Notes 
Following a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to determine the operational condition of the system was 
satisfactory, Baseline M&V data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. Four hundred hours after installation of 
PermaFrost NMR®, the M&V team returned on a very similar weather day to the Baseline to take Post M&V 
measurements in the identical fashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements and associated calculations 
show the amount of capacity restored.
The following IPMVP data points were recorded on 6 May 2014 using recently calibrated devices by NIST (National 
Institutes of Standards and Technology) to insure measurement accuracy. The CRAC unit was then treated with 
PermaFrost NMR® on the same day and allowed to run at greater than 90% load until 22 May 2014 to ensure the ECM 
had ample time to seat into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All measurements were taken at 100% load and 
at similar return air and outdoor air temperatures. 
Because the incoming air temperatures are much lower than the 80 degree incoming air used by AHRI to determine 
nominal tonnage ratings for this type of equipment, the actual tonnages will appear slightly higher than normal as the 
compressors and condensing units can do more work in cooler conditions. CFM was also 15% lower than design.
The collection of the data in both the baseline and post periods was collected by Powertron Global® under the watchful eye 
of the Telecom Provider Facility Engineer who oversees all the maintenance work done on the unit.  The measurements are listed below.

Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
CRAC Unit Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Telecom Provider Communications has the problem of thermal degradation in its HVAC/R units. The lower operating 
tonnage and COP ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate 
numbers. The degraded equipment performance is costing Telecom Provider Communications significant money and wasting 
energy. All of Telecom Provider’s equipment is using significantly more kWh to operate than it used when it was new. 
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the CRAC unit in the baseline and 
post testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. 
The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 4.1 operating tons and an 
improvement of 19.9% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the 
CRAC unit throughout the year. The Leibert CRAC unit treated has a nominal capacity of 20.5 tons at 100% 
load at 85 degree entering air. Since normal operations were not to be changed to accommodate the pilot, the 
emphasis here is on the delta between baseline and post.

Recovered Wasted Energy with PermaFrost NMR®
The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration the ECM created in the treated CRAC unit. 
The average cost to operate this unit before it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, was 1.03.
The specific cost to operate this unit after it was treated 
with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in kW/ton, is 
currently 0.86.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ 
was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate for 
a 16 year old CRAC unit. The post results are also in 
line with the average improvement savings shown over 
more than 120,000 installations globally.

HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Calculated Eﬃciency of Telecom Provider CRAC Unit in Baseline and Post
The chart below illustrates how far off design the Telecom Provider CRAC unit had degraded in terms of efficiency over 16 
years of being in use. The unit was performing at an average of 85.8%* of the original design efficiency when 
first installed. The actual design rated tonnage of each of this CRAC unit is 20.5 tons. In actuality however, the 
unit was producing 17.6* tons at the start of the pilot. The majority of this 14.2% or more efficiency loss was 
directly attributable to thermal degradation of the heat exchange surfaces that naturally occurs over time, creating a barrier to optimal heat transfer through the tube walls. 
After PermaFrost NMR® was installed, the average efficiency in the CRAC unit jumped up to 105.9%* of design 
specifications or 21.7* tons. This represents a 23.3% improvement in efficiency over the baseline numbers.

HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Cost to Telecom Provider to Operate the CRAC Unit in Baseline vs Post
The next chart illustrates how much money the efficiency performance loss in the pilot CRAC unit was costing 
Telecom Provider in the way of wasted energy each and every day they were operating prior to the ECM. The average cost to 
operate this unit as calculated in kW/ ton was 1.03 in the Baseline. When new, the kW/ton rating for units like 
these usually ranges from .75 to .9 kW/ton. This means Telecom Provider was paying up to 15% or more than design for 
energy to run the CRAC unit as a direct result of the baseline reduced level of performance. The kW/ton 
ratings measured on site in Allentown, PA were very much in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and 
cost to operate numbers.
  
The restored average kW/ton rating following the treatment is now .86. This represents a 16.5% reduction in 
energy costs from the baseline for every ton of cooling produced. It also brings down the Telecom Provider costs to operate 
the unit to just over design. This will result in an initial payback period to Telecom Provider of approximately 14.8 months. 
Over just a few years these accumulated savings will greatly reduce the eventual CapEx costs to replace the 
CRAC unit when it finally reaches the end of its useful life.

Return On Investment
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the Telecom Provider CRAC Unit.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 17.6 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: 1.03 kW/ton * 21.7 tons = 22.35 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 22.35 kW * 5,500 Annual Operating Hrs = 122,925 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 122,925 kWh * $.10 = $12,293
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: .86 kW/ton * 21.7 tons = 18.66 kW
Annual kWh Post: 18.66 kW * 5,500 hours = 102,630 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 102,630 kWh * .10 cents = $10,263
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $12,293 - $10,263 = $2,030
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $2,030 / 12 = $169
Return On Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot CRAC unit: $2,500
Estimated ROI Period for Pilot CRAC Unit: $2,500 / $169 = 14.8 months
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period 
for Telecom Provider Communications for implementing the PermaFrost NMR®, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate 
the true energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh 
expended in the Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems was when 
operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then 
subtracting the revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® was installed. 
This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the systems 
will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the internal building 
set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.

Notes
The pilot CRAC unit provides cooling to the 
main switching room at the Telecom Provider complex. Given 
the consistently heavy load and the other two 
CRAC units available to support in the cooling 
duties, the pilot unit runs approximately 5,500 
hours or more annually prior to the installation.

Telecom Provider Communications is Saving More than Just Energy
By treating just the pilot CRAC unit with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the current manner Telecom Provider 
Communications operates this unit, it will save approximately 20,295 kWh per year and all the costs 
associated with those savings. From an environmental impact standpoint, Telecom Provider is also benefitting the 
surrounding community of Allentown, PA. Imagine how great the environmental impact will be when Telecom Provider 
moves forward with treating all their climate control systems in across their portfolio.
The 20,295 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 14 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from being 
released or any of the following:
Annual greenhouse emissions from:
