Many industry leading \norganizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age. \nThermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVACR equipment that operates as a \nvapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well \ndocumented by the HVACR industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal degradation \nprevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times and additional \nkWh consumption.\nThe CRAC unit in this study is representative of a \ngreat majority of the portfolio of equipment \noperated by Telecom Provider Communications. If thermal \ndegradation is present in this CRAC unit, it is \npresent in the entire inventory of equipment. \nEnergy waste can be calculated based on this unit \n(portfolio representation) and then accurately \nextrapolated across the entire inventory of \nequipment.\n1\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 515, "chars": 2468, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_118_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:bb020e7ec965bb8eb3cdb6549722825a90531dc8c1459c88f11710bfeee9ceb4"}

The cooling capacity the CRAC unit is capable of producing after 16 years in service.\n \n2.

The thermal dynamic ability of the CRAC unit to still perform at or close to operational design.\nMethodology\nThe measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the \nIPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted of Telecom Provider’s Facility \nEngineering Manager, [Client Representative] and Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer].  \nNotes \nSince the post measurements were taken with outside air temperatures of 4 degrees cooler than in the baseline, actual amp \nreadings taken in the post were raised to normalize for the very slight affect the weather had on the condensing unit’s \nability to dissipate heat.  \nTelecom Provider’s management of the data center and the internal load during the trial provided more than an adequate heat load on \nthe pilot CRAC unit to ensure it would remain running during the actual data collection period. \nThe boundary of the testing was the CRAC unit and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance \ncalculations is very high.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 493, "chars": 2466, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_118_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_118_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:4bca1b1b37e106cb520de50d4b91b9e99495d8cad22eca29ed48814bd6ce7bfc"}

The report will also illustrate the amount of thermal \ndegradation that has occurred due in large part to thermal degradation within the heat exchangers and how much of \nthat has been restored.\n \nThe following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. \nThe results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:\n \n• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) \n \n• Tons = (Airflow * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta) / 12,000 \n \n• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage \n \n• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)\n \n• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Air Temp – Saturated Suction Temp \nNotes \nFollowing a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to determine the operational condition of the system was \nsatisfactory, Baseline M&V data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. Four hundred hours after installation of \nPermaFrost NMR®, the M&V team returned on a very similar weather day to the Baseline to take Post M&V \nmeasurements in the identical fashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements and associated calculations \nshow the amount of capacity restored.\nThe following IPMVP data points were recorded on 6 May 2014 using recently calibrated devices by NIST (National \nInstitutes of Standards and Technology) to insure measurement accuracy. The CRAC unit was then treated with \nPermaFrost NMR® on the same day and allowed to run at greater than 90% load until 22 May 2014 to ensure the ECM \nhad ample time to seat into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All measurements were taken at 100% load and \nat similar return air and outdoor air temperatures. \nBecause the incoming air temperatures are much lower than the 80 degree incoming air used by AHRI to determine \nnominal tonnage ratings for this type of equipment, the actual tonnages will appear slightly higher than normal as the \ncompressors and condensing units can do more work in cooler conditions. CFM was also 15% lower than design.\nThe collection of the data in both the baseline and post periods was collected by Powertron Global® under the watchful eye \nof the Telecom Provider Facility Engineer who oversees all the maintenance work done on the unit.

The lower operating \ntonnage and COP ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate \nnumbers. The degraded equipment performance is costing Telecom Provider Communications significant money and wasting \nenergy. All of Telecom Provider’s equipment is using significantly more kWh to operate than it used when it was new. \nThe performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the CRAC unit in the baseline and \npost testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. \nThe implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 4.1 operating tons and an \nimprovement of 19.9% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the \nCRAC unit throughout the year. The Leibert CRAC unit treated has a nominal capacity of 20.5 tons at 100% \nload at 85 degree entering air. Since normal operations were not to be changed to accommodate the pilot, the \nemphasis here is on the delta between baseline and post.  \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 644, "chars": 2549, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_118_chunk_0003", "next_id": "pdf_118_chunk_0005", "content_hash": "sha256:01e683445b1d96df57199868bb372bab26d9b5d45ffcefbc0d67206a0e26a75e"}

The unit was performing at an average of 85.8%* of the original design efficiency when \nfirst installed. The actual design rated tonnage of each of this CRAC unit is 20.5 tons. In actuality however, the \nunit was producing 17.6* tons at the start of the pilot. The majority of this 14.2% or more efficiency loss was \ndirectly attributable to thermal degradation of the heat exchange surfaces that naturally occurs over time, creating a barrier to optimal heat transfer through the tube walls. \nAfter PermaFrost NMR® was installed, the average efficiency in the CRAC unit jumped up to 105.9%* of design \nspecifications or 21.7* tons.

The average cost to \noperate this unit as calculated in kW/ ton was 1.03 in the Baseline. When new, the kW/ton rating for units like \nthese usually ranges from .75 to .9 kW/ton. This means Telecom Provider was paying up to 15% or more than design for \nenergy to run the CRAC unit as a direct result of the baseline reduced level of performance. The kW/ton \nratings measured on site in Allentown, PA were very much in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and \ncost to operate numbers.\n  \nThe restored average kW/ton rating following the treatment is now .86. This represents a 16.5% reduction in \nenergy costs from the baseline for every ton of cooling produced. It also brings down the Telecom Provider costs to operate \nthe unit to just over design. This will result in an initial payback period to Telecom Provider of approximately 14.8 months. \nOver just a few years these accumulated savings will greatly reduce the eventual CapEx costs to replace the \nCRAC unit when it finally reaches the end of its useful life.   \nOriginal Design\nEﬃciency\nASHRAE Projected\nCost to Operate\nOver Time\nActual Cost to\nOperate Telecom Provider\nSystems As Is\nOperational Cost %\nActual Telecom Provider HVAC/R Operating Cost\nvs. ASHRAE Historical Performance\n-40\n-20\n00\n20\n40\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n \n \n \nAvg Age of Telecom Provider\nEquipment\n16\nEXPECTED COST\nAge of HVAC/R Units\n16.5%\nin Energy Savings\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 582, "chars": 2389, "pages": {"start": 7, "end": 8}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_118_chunk_0005", "next_id": "pdf_118_chunk_0007", "content_hash": "sha256:55552969d8f6e8a5157358452e4c60b707505019176814734d3d7448005f9d48"}
