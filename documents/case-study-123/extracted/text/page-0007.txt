HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Calculated Eﬃciency of Telecom Provider CRAC Unit in Baseline and Post
The chart below illustrates how far off design the Telecom Provider CRAC unit had degraded in terms of efficiency over 16 
years of being in use. The unit was performing at an average of 85.8%* of the original design efficiency when 
first installed. The actual design rated tonnage of each of this CRAC unit is 20.5 tons. In actuality however, the 
unit was producing 17.6* tons at the start of the pilot. The majority of this 14.2% or more efficiency loss was 
directly attributable to thermal degradation of the heat exchange surfaces that naturally occurs
over time, creating a barrier to optimal heat transfer through the tube walls. 
After PermaFrost NMR® was installed, the average efficiency in the CRAC unit jumped up to 105.9%* of design 
specifications or 21.7* tons. This represents a 23.3% improvement in efficiency over the baseline numbers.
