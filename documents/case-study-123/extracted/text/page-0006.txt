Recovered Wasted Energy with PermaFrost NMR®
The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration the ECM created in the treated CRAC unit. 
The average cost to operate this unit before it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, was 1.03.
The specific cost to operate this unit after it was treated 
with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in kW/ton, is 
currently 0.86.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ 
was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate for 
a 16 year old CRAC unit. The post results are also in 
line with the average improvement savings shown over 
more than 120,000 installations globally.
