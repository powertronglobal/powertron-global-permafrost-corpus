HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Cost to Telecom Provider to Operate the CRAC Unit in Baseline vs Post
The next chart illustrates how much money the efficiency performance loss in the pilot CRAC unit was costing 
Telecom Provider in the way of wasted energy each and every day they were operating prior to the ECM. The average cost to 
operate this unit as calculated in kW/ ton was 1.03 in the Baseline. When new, the kW/ton rating for units like 
these usually ranges from .75 to .9 kW/ton. This means Telecom Provider was paying up to 15% or more than design for 
energy to run the CRAC unit as a direct result of the baseline reduced level of performance. The kW/ton 
ratings measured on site in Allentown, PA were very much in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and 
cost to operate numbers.
  
The restored average kW/ton rating following the treatment is now .86. This represents a 16.5% reduction in 
energy costs from the baseline for every ton of cooling produced. It also brings down the Telecom Provider costs to operate 
the unit to just over design. This will result in an initial payback period to Telecom Provider of approximately 14.8 months. 
Over just a few years these accumulated savings will greatly reduce the eventual CapEx costs to replace the 
CRAC unit when it finally reaches the end of its useful life.
