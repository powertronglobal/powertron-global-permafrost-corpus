The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the Telecom Provider CRAC Unit.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 17.6 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: 1.03 kW/ton * 21.7 tons = 22.35 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 22.35 kW * 5,500 Annual Operating Hrs = 122,925 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 122,925 kWh * $.10 = $12,293
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: .86 kW/ton * 21.7 tons = 18.66 kW
Annual kWh Post: 18.66 kW * 5,500 hours = 102,630 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 102,630 kWh * .10 cents = $10,263
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $12,293 - $10,263 = $2,030
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $2,030 / 12 = $169
Return On Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot CRAC unit: $2,500
Estimated ROI Period for Pilot CRAC Unit: $2,500 / $169 = 14.8 months
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period 
for Telecom Provider Communications for implementing the PermaFrost NMR®, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate 
the true energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh 
expended in the Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems was when 
operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then 
subtracting the revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® was installed. 
This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the systems 
will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the internal building 
set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
