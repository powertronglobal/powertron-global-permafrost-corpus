The following are the final calculated performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® Post 
measurement period.
Major Tire Manufacturer ROI Analysis  
Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to determine a very accurate ROI for 
Major Tire Manufacturer for implementing this ECM:
Baseline kW         1.24 kW/ton * 39.7 tons = 49.2 kW
Baseline Annual kWh         49.2 kW * 6,120 hours = 301,104 kWh
Baseline Annual Cost         301,104 kWh * .10 cents = $30,110
Regression Analysis is then used to account for the tonnage restored to the Split System  
Adjusted Baseline Tonnage         62.4 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted kW Baseline         1.24 kW/ton * 62.4 tons = 77.4 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh         77.4 kW * 6,120 Annual Operating Hrs = 473,688 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline         473,688 kWh * $.10 = $47,369
kW Post         .67 kW/ton * 62.4 tons = 41.8 kW
Annual kWh Post         41.8 kW * 6,120 hours = 255,816 kWh
Annual Cost Post         255,816 kWh * .10 cents = $25,582
