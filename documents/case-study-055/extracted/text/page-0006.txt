System Description / Design Characteristics
This split system provides the primary comfort cooling to the main offices at the [Eastern Cape Location] Major Tire Manufacturer manufac-
turing plant in South Africa and runs ~6,120 hours per year according to the bin data captured from that region.
Baseline and Post Measurements
The identical IPMVP following data were recorded for Baseline and Post on 2/22/13 and 5/1/13 respectively 
using recently NIST calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. The Return Air entering the coil was 
identical in both periods. Additionally, the discharge pressures of the compressors in both periods were very 
similar so no adjustments were made to the calculations. The measurements are as follows:
