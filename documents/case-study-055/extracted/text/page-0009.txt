        After the superheat is adjusted for each compressor, the refrigerant charge should also then be adjusted. 
The manufacturer’s suggested superheat range was not available, however a system such as this should 
operate in the 10 to 15 degree F (-12 to -9 ºC)  . Slight sweating of the rear of the compressor motor body 
should be evident as a result of a proper adjustment. Currently the superheat is above 33 degrees F (.5 ºC). 
High superheat is an indication of less than adequate refrigerant being supplied to the evaporator resulting 
in loss of cooling, dehumidification and overheating of the compressor hermetic motor and mechanical 
components.
