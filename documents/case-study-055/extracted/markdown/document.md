PermaFrost NMR® Eﬃciency Report

Major Tire Manufacturer

May, 2013

Executive Summary

This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure (ECM)

PermaFrost NMR® in the primary HVAC split system serving the main offices at the Major Tire Manufacturer

Manufacturing Plant located at [South Africa Manufacturing Facility Address], South Africa. Detailed forensic performance

testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on a nominal 70-ton (246kWR) air-cooled split DX system

using R22 refrigerant. Following testing, the unit was treated with the proper amount and type of the

PermaFrost NMR® technology specially formulated for these types of systems.

The improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly

at the system was solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR®

ECM. This is a result of the reversal of thermal inefficiency on heat exchange

surfaces, creating greater efficiency in refrigerant approach and the

thermal energy transfer abilities of the cooler and condenser vessels.

Following treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, the

system showed an effective net 46.1% reduction in kW based on

the exact capacity measured in the baseline M&V and the post

gestation M&V. With both 35-ton (123 kWR) compressors

operating at full load, the system showed a 15.5% reduction in

kW, while simultaneously producing an increase in capacity of

32.7 tons. This 57.1% increase from the baseline performance

levels produced an effective net reduction in kW/ton of 46.1%,

which directly correlates to what Major Tire Manufacturer will realize in energy

savings as they operate the system in the future under the same

parameters. Case in point, Major Tire Manufacturer has reported the system is

now able to attain set-point temperatures in the main offices on

most days while operating only one compressor instead of two.

Following treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, the Amp draw on the system was also

reduced by 15.6%. Simultaneously, the system showed a substantial 60.3% improvement in Enthalpy

Delta, which is a critical HVAC measurement used to determine the thermodynamic enhancement

brought about by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result of the ECM improvement is an ROI (Return on

Investment) to Major Tire Manufacturer that is measured in months. The tables of data are available for review at the

end of this report. Financial calculations determining the true ROI are proprietary to Major Tire Manufacturer under

separate cover.

Product Brief

PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure

(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) technology as its core agent. A sustainable,

one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any

type of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and

equipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX);

chilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia

refrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The

equipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal

(single and multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.

The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and

improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point temperatures in a more

rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from the

enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW hours

used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced carbon footprint

for Major Tire Manufacturer.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol

The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) was utilized in the

development of this report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating,

Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization

(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation

methods and products.

There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They

are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is

defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single

source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM

affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.

Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the

savings and the length of the reporting period. For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term

measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by

short-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations

using measurements of proxies of energy use.

The final computation follows the formula:

Energy Science Division

Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy

+/ - Routine Adjustments +/ - Non-Routine Adjustments

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content

The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the

effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces.

A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the unit’s operational

conditions were satisfactory.  Baseline measurements were recorded and then the proper amount and type

of PermaFrost NMR® was injected. The gestation period for the Major Tire Manufacturer pilot was six (6) weeks. At the

end of this gestation period, Post results were taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special

care to match the same or very similar entering air temperatures and compressor discharge pressures. These

are the two most critical measurements affected by the weather. When analyzing the data, no adjustments

for weather were necessary.

The following report produces the utilization of the International Performance Measurement and

Verification Protocol (IPMVP) as the M&V plan. The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global

Global’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer], CEM/CMC/CMVP. Douglas North,

Facilities Management Director, Major Tire Manufacturer [Eastern Cape Location] Plant, witnessed all phases of the M&V.

The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:

kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase)

BTUH = CFM X 4.5 (standard air) X Calculated Enthalpy Delta

kW / Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage or kWR

Percentage Eﬃciency = Measured BTUh / Manufacturers Design BTUh

Major Tire Manufacturer ROI Analysis

Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to determine a very accurate ROI for

Major Tire Manufacturer for implementing this ECM:

Baseline kW         1.24 kW/ton * 39.7 tons = 49.2 kW

Baseline Annual kWh         49.2 kW * 6,120 hours = 301,104 kWh

Baseline Annual Cost         301,104 kWh * .10 cents = $30,110

Regression Analysis is then used to account for the tonnage restored to the Split System

Adjusted Baseline Tonnage         62.4 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)

Adjusted kW Baseline         1.24 kW/ton * 62.4 tons = 77.4 kW

Adjusted Baseline kWh         77.4 kW * 6,120 Annual Operating Hrs = 473,688 kWh

Revised Cost to Run Baseline         473,688 kWh * $.10 = $47,369

kW Post         .67 kW/ton * 62.4 tons = 41.8 kW

Annual kWh Post         41.8 kW * 6,120 hours = 255,816 kWh

Annual Cost Post         255,816 kWh * .10 cents = $25,582

Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Month         ($47,369 - $25,582)/12 = $1,816

Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed         $8,750 / $1,816 = 5 months

ROI = 5 months

Engineering Conclusions

The client, Douglas North, Facilities Management Director, Major Tire Manufacturer [Eastern Cape Location] Plant was consulted

regarding this equipment after the avoided energy reporting period (post analysis) and the following

observations were discussed.

The evaporator coil has some visual mold growth on the leaving airside of the aluminum fins. This is

causing some additional pressure drop across the tube and fin evaporator.

2     The blower drive components are not performing at the proper RPM due to the degradation of drive

sheaves. Once corrected, the belts should also be replaced. This is causing a reduction in the area of available

delivered cubic feet of supply air per minute (CFM). Please note that this condition was present during the

baseline data period and was not corrected until after this pilot analysis was to be completed. Now that the

pilot testing period has ended, this correction should commence.

2     Compressor number one (1) was recently replaced and is now showing evidence of overheating. There

is a refrigerant leak emitting from the capillary tubing connecting the compressor to its respective safety

switches. Evidence of this refrigerant oil can be seen inside of the pressure controls section cabinet.

There are four segregated sections of evaporator coils that are joined together creating one evaporator.

Compressor #1 serves two of the circuits and the other two circuits are served by compressor #2. Each

section of the respective circuits is comprised of two thermostatic expansion valves (TXV) for each

compressor. Each of these TXV’s had a different superheat. This should be corrected in a timely manner. The

evaporator should be cleaned and the belts and sheaves should be corrected before this adjustment is

initiated.

After the superheat is adjusted for each compressor, the refrigerant charge should also then be adjusted.

The manufacturer’s suggested superheat range was not available, however a system such as this should

operate in the 10 to 15 degree F (-12 to -9 ºC)  . Slight sweating of the rear of the compressor motor body

should be evident as a result of a proper adjustment. Currently the superheat is above 33 degrees F (.5 ºC).

High superheat is an indication of less than adequate refrigerant being supplied to the evaporator resulting

in loss of cooling, dehumidification and overheating of the compressor hermetic motor and mechanical

components.
