Detailed forensic performance \ntesting (outlined later in this report) was performed on a nominal 70-ton (246kWR) air-cooled split DX system \nusing R22 refrigerant. Following testing, the unit was treated with the proper amount and type of the \nPermaFrost NMR® technology specially formulated for these types of systems. \nThe improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly \nat the system was solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® \nECM. This is a result of the reversal of thermal inefficiency on heat exchange \nsurfaces, creating greater efficiency in refrigerant approach and the \nthermal energy transfer abilities of the cooler and condenser vessels. \nFollowing treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, the \nsystem showed an effective net 46.1% reduction in kW based on \nthe exact capacity measured in the baseline M&V and the post \ngestation M&V. With both 35-ton (123 kWR) compressors \noperating at full load, the system showed a 15.5% reduction in \nkW, while simultaneously producing an increase in capacity of \n32.7 tons. This 57.1% increase from the baseline performance \nlevels produced an effective net reduction in kW/ton of 46.1%, \nwhich directly correlates to what Major Tire Manufacturer will realize in energy \nsavings as they operate the system in the future under the same \nparameters. Case in point, Major Tire Manufacturer has reported the system is \nnow able to attain set-point temperatures in the main offices on \nmost days while operating only one compressor instead of two.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 602, "chars": 2740, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_056_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:24ce22b9f10dbc1f3f74840871e148af8a8b5086f33f06ec4439a983b431e005"}

Simultaneously, the system showed a substantial 60.3% improvement in Enthalpy \nDelta, which is a critical HVAC measurement used to determine the thermodynamic enhancement \nbrought about by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result of the ECM improvement is an ROI (Return on \nInvestment) to Major Tire Manufacturer that is measured in months. The tables of data are available for review at the \nend of this report. Financial calculations determining the true ROI are proprietary to Major Tire Manufacturer under \nseparate cover.  \nProduct Brief\n         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure \n(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any \ntype of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and \nequipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); \nchilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia \nrefrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The \nequipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal \n(single and multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and \nimproved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point temperatures in a more \nrapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from the \nenhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW hours \nused, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced carbon footprint \nfor Major Tire Manufacturer.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 557, "chars": 2684, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_056_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_056_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:6d8cf0cd6ff8bd68085b155bbaf3b802e90d5ff6baf11dadbe881191f890e2cf"}

The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating, \nRefrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization \n(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation \nmethods and products.\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is \ndefined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single \nsource of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM \naffected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period. For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations \nusing measurements of proxies of energy use. \nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+/ - Routine Adjustments +/ - Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 445, "chars": 2210, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_056_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_056_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:c79e6b7499dc80b6daf4b90da5df775e65d36a8cf6816852160022b1a6d46e4a"}

This is \ncausing some additional pressure drop across the tube and fin evaporator.\n \n 2     The blower drive components are not performing at the proper RPM due to the degradation of drive \nsheaves. Once corrected, the belts should also be replaced. This is causing a reduction in the area of available \ndelivered cubic feet of supply air per minute (CFM). Please note that this condition was present during the \nbaseline data period and was not corrected until after this pilot analysis was to be completed. Now that the \npilot testing period has ended, this correction should commence.\n 2     Compressor number one (1) was recently replaced and is now showing evidence of overheating. There \nis a refrigerant leak emitting from the capillary tubing connecting the compressor to its respective safety \nswitches. Evidence of this refrigerant oil can be seen inside of the pressure controls section cabinet.\n        There are four segregated sections of evaporator coils that are joined together creating one evaporator. \nCompressor #1 serves two of the circuits and the other two circuits are served by compressor #2. Each \nsection of the respective circuits is comprised of two thermostatic expansion valves (TXV) for each \ncompressor. Each of these TXV’s had a different superheat. This should be corrected in a timely manner. The \nevaporator should be cleaned and the belts and sheaves should be corrected before this adjustment is \ninitiated.\n4\n1\n2\n3\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\nEnergy Science Division\n        After the superheat is adjusted for each compressor, the refrigerant charge should also then be adjusted. \nThe manufacturer’s suggested superheat range was not available, however a system such as this should \noperate in the 10 to 15 degree F (-12 to -9 ºC)  . Slight sweating of the rear of the compressor motor body \nshould be evident as a result of a proper adjustment. Currently the superheat is above 33 degrees F (.5 ºC). \nHigh superheat is an indication of less than adequate refrigerant being supplied to the evaporator resulting \nin loss of cooling, dehumidification and overheating of the compressor hermetic motor and mechanical \ncomponents.\n5\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 768, "chars": 3572, "pages": {"start": 7, "end": 9}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_056_chunk_0006", "next_id": "", "content_hash": "sha256:6a7540e2869bc459a8c35f9e01fd948a4029f2fbacac0265f1511672d1f2ed5e"}
