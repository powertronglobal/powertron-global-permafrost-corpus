       UL 984A: Testing UL classified lubricant for use with compressor motor insulating materials and 
refrigerants.
UL has developed specifications to classify lubricant used in sealed motor compressors of air conditioning and 
refrigeration equipment.  The UL program covers lubricants and the indicated refrigerants for all
insulating materials used in industry-recognized hermetic refrigerant motor-compressors.
       ASHRAE 86 - 1994: Completed Refrigeration oil floc point, °F.
The temperature in which waxy materials in lubricating oil separate from a mixture of oil and refrigerant, giving a 
cloudy appearance. This test is important in that it evaluates the tendency of refrigeration oils to plug expansion valves 
or capillaries in refrigeration systems.
Results: - 60°F
       ASHRAE 99: Completed Refrigeration oil description.
Refrigeration oils can be described as those that operate with certain values of different refrigerants. Separation, 
temperature, and viscosity are a few examples. This test examines these parameters and defines
oil as refrigerant compatible.
Results: refrigerant compatible
       ASTM D1500: Completed Color scale
This test is used to compare a range of colors against the colors of other petroleum products. This is the most common 
test, extensively used for industrial and process oils.
Results: <.05
Results: 2400ft/lbs@1 min before failure. Exceeds standards

This test method, used for specification purposes, differentiates between lubricating fluids having low, medium, and high 
level of extreme-pressure properties. In the Four-ball method, the anti-wear property is determined from the average 
scar diameter on the stationary balls and is stated in terms of a load-wear index. The smaller the scar, the better the 
load-wear index. The maximum load carrying capability is defined in terms of a weld point; i.e. the load at which 
welding by frictional heat occurs.

       ASTM D665A: Completed Rust inhibitor.
A type of additive for protecting lubricated metal surfaces against chemical attack by water or other contaminants. 
Polar compounds wet the surface preferentially, protecting it with a film of oil.
Results: <0.5%
       ASTM D611: Completed Aniline point, °F.
The lowest temperature at which a specified quantity of aniline (a benzene derivative) is soluble in a specified quantity 
of petroleum product, i.e. the solvent power of a hydrocarbon. The lower aniline point, the greater the solvency.
Results: 11°F
       ASTM D877: Completed Dielectric breakdown, kV.
The minimum voltage required to produce an electric arc through an oil sample, hence an indication of the insulating 
(arc preventive) properties of an oil.
Results: 41 kV
       ASTM D93: Completed Flash point, °F.
The lowest temperature at which the vapor of a combustible liquid can be made to ignite momentarily in air. Flash point 
is an important indicator of the fire and explosion hazards associated with petroleum products.
Results: 370°F
       ASTM D1744: Completed Water content, PPM.
A method used for obtaining a semi-quantitative estimate of the amount of trace water present in a finished lubricant.
Results: 10 PPM
       ASTM D445: Completed Viscosity @ 100°F.
This test measures the fluid's resistance to flow. Liquids change viscosity with temperature, becoming less viscous when 
heated. High pressures, or load, tend to squeeze the oil out of the bearing, which calls for the greater film strength of a 
high-viscosity oil.
Results: 7.8
       ASTM D97: Completed Pour point, °F.
The lowest temperature at which oil is observed to flow, when cooled under conditions as defined by ASTM D97. The 
pour point is 5°F above the temperature at which the oil in a test vessel shows no movement
when the container is held horizontally for five seconds.
Results: -70°F.

       ASTM D1287: Completed Test for pH.
Measures the acidity or alkalinity of an aqueous solution. The pH scale ranges from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline), 
with a pH of 7 indicating a neutral solution equivalent to the pH of distilled water.
Results: 6.18
       ASTM D2717: Completed Thermal conductivity.
Measures the ability to conduct heat. The higher the conductivity, the quicker molecules transfer heat under high 
temperatures.
Results: Refrigerant oil only - 0.94; with PermaFrost - 1.18
       ASTM D1384: Completed Corrosion test.
The chemical attack on metal or other solid contaminants in a lubricant. Common corrosive contaminants are (1) water, 
which causes rust, and (2) acids, which may form as oxidation products in deteriorating oil.
Results: -3 to -5
       ASTM D4052, D70: Completed API gravity @ 60°F.
Higher API gravity values translate into lower material density, which would mean a lower specific gravity.
Results: .9200
       EPA 6010: Completed Total metals.
Measures the amount of metal particles in lubricants.
Results: all < 1.0 PPM
       EPA 7471: Atomic absorption for mercury.
The process of hydrocarbon analysis to determine mercury content.
Results: < .05
       EPA 9020B: Total halogens.
The standard for determining the percentage concentration of all halogens in lubricants.

       ARI Modified 210/240: Testing Unitary air conditioning and air source heat pump equipment.
This standard is intended for the guidance of the industry, including manufacturers, engineers, installers, contractors, 
and users. All procedures are defined by ARI and run under ARI supervision. The tests are independently monitored by 
ARI field engineers. Because ARI Standard 210 required constant load and humidity control, ARI modified the test to 
measure heat transfer at the test site and actual location for
the HVAC systems.
       ARI Modified 550: Testing Water chilling packages using the vapor compression cycle.
This standard is intended for the guidance of the industry, including manufacturers, engineers, installers, contractors, 
and users. The standard applies to all vapor compression refrigeration water chilling
packages including one or more hermetic or open drive compressors (centrifugal, rotary, screw, scroll, reciprocating, or 
other types), equipped with either water-cooled, air-cooled, evaporative cooled
condensers, or supplied without a condenser.
