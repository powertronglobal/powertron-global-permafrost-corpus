       ASTM D1287: Completed Test for pH.
Measures the acidity or alkalinity of an aqueous solution. The pH scale ranges from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline), 
with a pH of 7 indicating a neutral solution equivalent to the pH of distilled water.
Results: 6.18
       ASTM D2717: Completed Thermal conductivity.
Measures the ability to conduct heat. The higher the conductivity, the quicker molecules transfer heat under high 
temperatures.
Results: Refrigerant oil only - 0.94; with PermaFrost - 1.18
       ASTM D1384: Completed Corrosion test.
The chemical attack on metal or other solid contaminants in a lubricant. Common corrosive contaminants are (1) water, 
which causes rust, and (2) acids, which may form as oxidation products in deteriorating oil.
Results: -3 to -5
       ASTM D4052, D70: Completed API gravity @ 60°F.
Higher API gravity values translate into lower material density, which would mean a lower specific gravity.
Results: .9200
       EPA 6010: Completed Total metals.
Measures the amount of metal particles in lubricants.
Results: all < 1.0 PPM
       EPA 7471: Atomic absorption for mercury.
The process of hydrocarbon analysis to determine mercury content.
Results: < .05
       EPA 9020B: Total halogens.
The standard for determining the percentage concentration of all halogens in lubricants.
Results: 364
       PPMANSI - Compatibility with Hydrocarbons (Group 1, 2, 3): Completed
Results: Compatible
