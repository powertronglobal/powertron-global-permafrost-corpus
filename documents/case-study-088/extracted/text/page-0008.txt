Chiller Eﬃciency Study Results
Cost to Major Gaming Company to Operate the Chiller Baseline vs Post
The next chart illustrates the just how much money the efficiency performance loss in the pilot chiller was 
costing Major Gaming Company in the way of wasted energy each and every day they were operating prior to the ECM. 
The average cost to operate the chiller as calculated in kW/ ton was .658 in the Baseline. When new, the 
kW/ton rating for chillers like these usually range from .48 - .51 kW/ton. This means Major Gaming Company was paying 
up to 27% more than design for the energy to run the chiller as a direct result of the baseline reduced level of 
performance. These kW/ton ratings are very much in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to 
operate numbers.
  
The restored average kW/ton rating for the chiller following the ECM is now .517. This represents a 21.4% 
reduction in energy costs for the chiller from the baseline for every ton of cooling produced. It also brings down 
the Major Gaming Company costs to operate the chiller to nearly what they were when the chiller was new.  
The $45,919 in annual energy savings generated during the pilot have resulted in a payback period to Penn 
Gaming of approximately 8.4 months. Over just a few years these accumulated savings will greatly reduce the 
eventual CapEx costs to replace the chillers when they finally reach the end of their useful life.
