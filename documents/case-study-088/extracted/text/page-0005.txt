Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Chiller Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Major Gaming Company/Hollywood Casinos have the problem of thermal degradation in their HVAC/R units. The 
lower baseline operating tonnage and COP ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of 
performance and cost to operate numbers. The degraded equipment performance was costing Major Gaming Company 
significant money and wasting energy. The equipment was using significantly more kWh to operate than it used 
when it was new. 
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the chiller in the baseline and post 
testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. 
The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 293 operating tons, an improvement 
of 27.1% in Coefficient of Performance (COP) and a reduction in kW/ton of 21.4%, significantly reducing the 
cost to operate the chiller throughout the year.
The York chiller treated has a nominal capacity of 1,500 tons and 3,528 gallons per minute (GPM) flow through 
the evaporator. The chiller used in this pilot was tested at 90% load with a GPM flow right near design after 
adjusting on site prior to starting the baseline readings.
