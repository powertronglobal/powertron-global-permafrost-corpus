The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the Major Gaming Company Chiller.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 1,098 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: .658 kW/ton * 1,391 tons = 915.3 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 915.3 kW * 2,927 Annual Operating Hrs = 2,679,083 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 2,679,083 kWh * $.08 = $214,327
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: .517 kW/ton * 1,391 tons = 719.1 kW
Annual kWh Post: 719.1 kW * 2,927 hours = 2,104,806 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 2,104,806 kWh * .08 cents = $168,384
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $214,327 - $168,384 = $45,943
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $45,943 / 12 = $3,829
Return On Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot chiller: $32,000
Estimated ROI Period for Chiller: $32,000 / $3,829 = 8.4 months
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for 
Major Gaming Company for implementing the PermaFrost NMR®, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true 
energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in 
the Post Analysis Period or reduces the load. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems was when 
operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then 
subtracting the revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® was installed. 
This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours or reduced load 
the systems will now operate at due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the internal 
building set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
