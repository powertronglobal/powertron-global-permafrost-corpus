Chiller Eﬃciency Study Results
Calculated Eﬃciency of Major Gaming Company Chillers Baseline and Post
The chart below illustrates just how far off design the Major Gaming Company pilot chiller had degraded in terms of 
efficiency over an average of 17 years of the heat exchange coils being in use. 
The chiller was performing at an average of 73.2% of the original design efficiency when it was first installed. 
The nominal design rated tonnage of the chiller is 1,500 tons. In actuality however, the chiller was only 
producing 1,098 tons at the start of the pilot. The majority of the 26.8% efficiency loss in the chiller is directly 
attributable to the thermal degradation of the heat exchange surfaces. This is due in large part to thermal degradation 
creating an insulating barrier to heat transfer through the tube walls. 
After the ECM was installed, the average efficiency in the chiller jumped up to 92.7% of design specifications or 
1,391 tons.  This represents a 26.7% improvement in efficiency over the baseline numbers.
