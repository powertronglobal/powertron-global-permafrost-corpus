HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report
Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study
The purpose of this study is to verify the industry wide problem of efficiency loss in HVAC/R as projected by 
ASHRAE research and to quantify the amount of money wasted due to this loss. Many industry leading 
organizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age. 
Thermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVACR equipment that operates as a 
vapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well 
documented by the HVACR industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal degradation 
prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times and additional 
kWh consumption.
The chiller in this study is representative of the portfolio of comfort cooling equipment operated by Penn 
Gaming throughout their Hollywood Casino portfolio. If thermal degradation is present in this chiller, it is 
present in the entire inventory of equipment. Energy waste can be calculated based on this equipment (portfolio 
representation) and then accurately extrapolated across the entire inventory of equipment. 
Similarly, if the lost efficiency of this chiller can be 
restored, it would allow Major Gaming Company to keep it in 
service longer without sacrificing performance or 
energy consumption. It will also provide Penn 
Gaming and Hollywood Casinos the flexibility of a 
much wider window of time wherein to undertake 
the costly capital expense of replacing it when it 
does finally reach the end of its useful life.

Process
This report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of one of three main 
chillers that support the Hollywood Casino St. Louis. 
Detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the pilot chiller before and after 
the installation of the PermaFrost NMR® to determine the impact on the three key elements that greatly affect 
Major Gaming Company’s HVAC power bill as they relate to the original design specifications:
 
 
1.  The cooling capacity the chiller is capable of producing after 17 years in service. 
 
2.  The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the chiller is delivering as 
 
     reflected in the kW/ton measurement. 
 
3.  The thermal dynamic ability of the chiller to still perform at or close to operational design.
Methodology
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the 
IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team was led by Penn 
Gaming’s Facility Manager, [Client Representative] and [Client Representative], facilities technician. Also playing a key role in 
the pilot was Murphy Mechanical Services’ Jeff Gumm, Sr. Mechanical Engineer and [Senior Energy Engineer], 
Director of Engineering for Powertron Global.  The overall project was managed and directed by Joelle 
Shearin, Asst. General Manager for Hollywood Casino St. Louis.  
Engineering Notes 
Both the baseline and post readings were taken at 90% load with incoming condenser water at 84 degrees and incoming 
chilled water at 55 degrees, therefore no adjustments were made to the resulting data. Major Gaming Company’s management of the 
chiller plant combined with the building load during the trial provided more than an adequate heat load on the facility to 
ensure the chiller would remain running during the actual data collection period.  
The chiller was tested over the span of nearly three months. During the trial the chiller experienced an unrelated oil seal 
failure and loss of some oil & refrigerant. Oil samples from the chiller at the time of the seal failure revealed the oil was still 
serviceable with no abnormalities present. Since PermaFrost NMR® had already had time to seat into the metal surfaces of 
the heat exchanges, the chiller did not need to be retreated. Once put back into operation, the chiller was allowed to run for 
an additional week before post readings were taken.
The boundary of the testing was the chiller and nothing else, therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance 
calculations is very high.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the pilot chiller to perform prior to the 
PermaFrost NMR® (ECM) being installed, as well as illustrate the amount of thermal degradation due in large 
part to thermal degradation within the heat exchangers (evaporator and condenser barrels).  The following report 
produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following applicable thermodynamic 
engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
 
• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU 
 
• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Water Temp – Saturated Evaporator Temp (CH) 
Notes 
Following a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to determine the 
operational condition of the systems, it was determined that the chiller had a 
much higher volume of water flowing through it than design so the team 
adjusted it downward to OEM specifications. With all other chiller 
conditions deemed satisfactory, Baseline M&V data was collected and 
recorded by the M&V team. 
Three months after installation of the ECM, the M&V team returned to take 
Post M&V measurements in the identical fashion as in the Baseline. The 
delta of these measurements and associated calculations show the amount of 
capacity restored.
The collection of the data in both the baseline and post periods was collected 
by Powertron Global and witnessed by Major Gaming Company’s facility technician.  
Photographic evidence of the measurements is available upon request. The 
measurements are listed below. 
M&V team works to adjust flow rates through 
the chiller’s evaporator and condenser barrels, 
restoring them to York specifications before 
recording all the baseline readings.

Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Chiller Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Major Gaming Company/Hollywood Casinos have the problem of thermal degradation in their HVAC/R units. The 
lower baseline operating tonnage and COP ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of 
performance and cost to operate numbers. The degraded equipment performance was costing Major Gaming Company 
significant money and wasting energy. The equipment was using significantly more kWh to operate than it used 
when it was new. 
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the chiller in the baseline and post 
testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. 
The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 293 operating tons, an improvement 
of 27.1% in Coefficient of Performance (COP) and a reduction in kW/ton of 21.4%, significantly reducing the 
cost to operate the chiller throughout the year.
The York chiller treated has a nominal capacity of 1,500 tons and 3,528 gallons per minute (GPM) flow through 
the evaporator. The chiller used in this pilot was tested at 90% load with a GPM flow right near design after 
adjusting on site prior to starting the baseline readings.

Recovered Wasted Energy with PermaFrost NMR® -  Chiller
The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration PermaFrost NMR® created in the treated 
chiller. The average cost to operate this chiller before it 
was treated, as calculated in kW/ton, was .658.
The specific cost to operate this chiller after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, is currently .517.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ 
was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate 
for a 17 year old chiller. The post results are also in 
line with the average improvement savings shown 
over more than 120,000 installations globally.

Chiller Eﬃciency Study Results
Calculated Eﬃciency of Major Gaming Company Chillers Baseline and Post
The chart below illustrates just how far off design the Major Gaming Company pilot chiller had degraded in terms of 
efficiency over an average of 17 years of the heat exchange coils being in use. 
The chiller was performing at an average of 73.2% of the original design efficiency when it was first installed. 
The nominal design rated tonnage of the chiller is 1,500 tons. In actuality however, the chiller was only 
producing 1,098 tons at the start of the pilot. The majority of the 26.8% efficiency loss in the chiller is directly 
attributable to the thermal degradation of the heat exchange surfaces. This is due in large part to thermal degradation 
creating an insulating barrier to heat transfer through the tube walls. 
After the ECM was installed, the average efficiency in the chiller jumped up to 92.7% of design specifications or 
1,391 tons.  This represents a 26.7% improvement in efficiency over the baseline numbers.

Chiller Eﬃciency Study Results
Cost to Major Gaming Company to Operate the Chiller Baseline vs Post
The next chart illustrates the just how much money the efficiency performance loss in the pilot chiller was 
costing Major Gaming Company in the way of wasted energy each and every day they were operating prior to the ECM. 
The average cost to operate the chiller as calculated in kW/ ton was .658 in the Baseline. When new, the 
kW/ton rating for chillers like these usually range from .48 - .51 kW/ton. This means Major Gaming Company was paying 
up to 27% more than design for the energy to run the chiller as a direct result of the baseline reduced level of 
performance. These kW/ton ratings are very much in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to 
operate numbers.
  
The restored average kW/ton rating for the chiller following the ECM is now .517. This represents a 21.4% 
reduction in energy costs for the chiller from the baseline for every ton of cooling produced. It also brings down 
the Major Gaming Company costs to operate the chiller to nearly what they were when the chiller was new.  
The $45,919 in annual energy savings generated during the pilot have resulted in a payback period to Penn 
Gaming of approximately 8.4 months. Over just a few years these accumulated savings will greatly reduce the 
eventual CapEx costs to replace the chillers when they finally reach the end of their useful life.

Return On Investment
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the Major Gaming Company Chiller.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 1,098 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: .658 kW/ton * 1,391 tons = 915.3 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 915.3 kW * 2,927 Annual Operating Hrs = 2,679,083 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 2,679,083 kWh * $.08 = $214,327
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: .517 kW/ton * 1,391 tons = 719.1 kW
Annual kWh Post: 719.1 kW * 2,927 hours = 2,104,806 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 2,104,806 kWh * .08 cents = $168,384
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $214,327 - $168,384 = $45,943
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $45,943 / 12 = $3,829
Return On Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot chiller: $32,000
Estimated ROI Period for Chiller: $32,000 / $3,829 = 8.4 months
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for 
Major Gaming Company for implementing the PermaFrost NMR®, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true 
energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in 
the Post Analysis Period or reduces the load. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems was when 
operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then 
subtracting the revised cost to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® was installed. 
This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours or reduced load 
the systems will now operate at due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the internal 
building set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.

Estimated Savings to Major Gaming Company for Treating 25-Facility Portfolio
The 8.4-month ROI achieved during the pilot is slightly better than the average 10-12 month ROI PermaFrost 
NMR® clients normally realize in similar aged chiller systems. The chart below illustrates the substantial 
savings potential Major Gaming Company Corporate will realize by moving forward this summer with treating their 
portfolio of HVACR equipment. The following simple assumptions were used in the calculations:
 
• 12 year average age of HVAC equipment; 
 
• 3,000 tons of cooling required per location split between two 1,500 ton chillers; 
 
• Each chiller system runs 3,000 hours each year; 
 
• Average cost of $.09 per kWh delivered across all 25 facilities;
 
• Full cost to treat the chillers at each of 25 facilities is $64,000, totaling $1,600,000 
Kilowatt Hours (kWh) Loss / Gain With / Without PermaFrost NMR® Treatment
Savings indicated inside red circle equates to a 10.4 Month Project Payback for Major Gaming Company when treating 
25 locations across the US. This is determined by dividing the $64,000 cost of treating the assumed two 
1,500-ton chillers at each location with PermaFrost NMR® by the anticipated annual savings of $73,823 and 
then multiplying the result by 12 months. 
Savings indicated inside orange circle equates to an overall ROI for Major Gaming Company of 1,167% over the 
remaining 10 years of projected useful system life across the 25-facility portfolio. This is determined by 
dividing the projected 10 years of avoided cost savings of $18,676,975 spread across 25 facilities by the 
$1,600,000 cost of treating the portfolio with PermaFrost NMR® and then multiplying the result by 100.
