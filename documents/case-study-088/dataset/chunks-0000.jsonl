Many industry leading \norganizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age. \nThermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVACR equipment that operates as a \nvapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well \ndocumented by the HVACR industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal degradation \nprevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times and additional \nkWh consumption.\nThe chiller in this study is representative of the portfolio of comfort cooling equipment operated by Penn \nGaming throughout their Hollywood Casino portfolio. If thermal degradation is present in this chiller, it is \npresent in the entire inventory of equipment. Energy waste can be calculated based on this equipment (portfolio \nrepresentation) and then accurately extrapolated across the entire inventory of equipment. \nSimilarly, if the lost efficiency of this chiller can be \nrestored, it would allow Major Gaming Company to keep it in \nservice longer without sacrificing performance or \nenergy consumption. It will also provide Penn \nGaming and Hollywood Casinos the flexibility of a \nmuch wider window of time wherein to undertake \nthe costly capital expense of replacing it when it \ndoes finally reach the end of its useful life.   \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 626, "chars": 3022, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_087_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:dc64d4161645a70478077401cb0a2389cb61c407c9b325c4218a50536b7f03ac"}

The cooling capacity the chiller is capable of producing after 17 years in service. \n \n2.  The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the chiller is delivering as \n \n     reflected in the kW/ton measurement. \n \n3.  The thermal dynamic ability of the chiller to still perform at or close to operational design.\nMethodology\nThe measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the \nIPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team was led by Penn \nGaming’s Facility Manager, [Client Representative] and [Client Representative], facilities technician. Also playing a key role in \nthe pilot was Murphy Mechanical Services’ Jeff Gumm, Sr. Mechanical Engineer and [Senior Energy Engineer], \nDirector of Engineering for Powertron Global.  The overall project was managed and directed by Joelle \nShearin, Asst. General Manager for Hollywood Casino St. Louis.  \nEngineering Notes \nBoth the baseline and post readings were taken at 90% load with incoming condenser water at 84 degrees and incoming \nchilled water at 55 degrees, therefore no adjustments were made to the resulting data. Major Gaming Company’s management of the \nchiller plant combined with the building load during the trial provided more than an adequate heat load on the facility to \nensure the chiller would remain running during the actual data collection period.  \nThe chiller was tested over the span of nearly three months. During the trial the chiller experienced an unrelated oil seal \nfailure and loss of some oil & refrigerant. Oil samples from the chiller at the time of the seal failure revealed the oil was still \nserviceable with no abnormalities present. Since PermaFrost NMR® had already had time to seat into the metal surfaces of \nthe heat exchanges, the chiller did not need to be retreated. Once put back into operation, the chiller was allowed to run for \nan additional week before post readings were taken.\nThe boundary of the testing was the chiller and nothing else, therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance \ncalculations is very high.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 663, "chars": 3275, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_087_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_087_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:41abbe803f891052128fbf79f431d4953c57c6dc969336ccf6586d91177cf6b3"}

The following report \nproduces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. \nThe results were formulated by entering the data into the following applicable thermodynamic \nengineering formulas:\n \n• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) \n \n• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage \n \n• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)\n \n• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU \n \n• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Water Temp – Saturated Evaporator Temp (CH) \nNotes \nFollowing a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to determine the \noperational condition of the systems, it was determined that the chiller had a \nmuch higher volume of water flowing through it than design so the team \nadjusted it downward to OEM specifications. With all other chiller \nconditions deemed satisfactory, Baseline M&V data was collected and \nrecorded by the M&V team. \nThree months after installation of the ECM, the M&V team returned to take \nPost M&V measurements in the identical fashion as in the Baseline. The \ndelta of these measurements and associated calculations show the amount of \ncapacity restored.\nThe collection of the data in both the baseline and post periods was collected \nby Powertron Global and witnessed by Major Gaming Company’s facility technician.  \nPhotographic evidence of the measurements is available upon request.

In actuality however, the chiller was only \nproducing 1,098 tons at the start of the pilot. The majority of the 26.8% efficiency loss in the chiller is directly \nattributable to the thermal degradation of the heat exchange surfaces. This is due in large part to thermal degradation \ncreating an insulating barrier to heat transfer through the tube walls. \nAfter the ECM was installed, the average efficiency in the chiller jumped up to 92.7% of design specifications or \n1,391 tons.

When new, the \nkW/ton rating for chillers like these usually range from .48 - .51 kW/ton. This means Major Gaming Company was paying \nup to 27% more than design for the energy to run the chiller as a direct result of the baseline reduced level of \nperformance. These kW/ton ratings are very much in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to \noperate numbers.\n  \nThe restored average kW/ton rating for the chiller following the ECM is now .517. This represents a 21.4% \nreduction in energy costs for the chiller from the baseline for every ton of cooling produced. It also brings down \nthe Major Gaming Company costs to operate the chiller to nearly what they were when the chiller was new.  \nThe $45,919 in annual energy savings generated during the pilot have resulted in a payback period to Penn \nGaming of approximately 8.4 months.

The chart below illustrates the substantial \nsavings potential Major Gaming Company Corporate will realize by moving forward this summer with treating their \nportfolio of HVACR equipment. The following simple assumptions were used in the calculations:\n \n• 12 year average age of HVAC equipment; \n \n• 3,000 tons of cooling required per location split between two 1,500 ton chillers; \n \n• Each chiller system runs 3,000 hours each year; \n \n• Average cost of $.09 per kWh delivered across all 25 facilities;\n \n• Full cost to treat the chillers at each of 25 facilities is $64,000, totaling $1,600,000 \nKilowatt Hours (kWh) Loss / Gain With / Without PermaFrost NMR® Treatment\nSavings indicated inside red circle equates to a 10.4 Month Project Payback for Major Gaming Company when treating \n25 locations across the US. This is determined by dividing the $64,000 cost of treating the assumed two \n1,500-ton chillers at each location with PermaFrost NMR® by the anticipated annual savings of $73,823 and \nthen multiplying the result by 12 months. \nSavings indicated inside orange circle equates to an overall ROI for Major Gaming Company of 1,167% over the \nremaining 10 years of projected useful system life across the 25-facility portfolio. This is determined by \ndividing the projected 10 years of avoided cost savings of $18,676,975 spread across 25 facilities by the \n$1,600,000 cost of treating the portfolio with PermaFrost NMR® and then multiplying the result by 100.", "tokens": 1103, "chars": 3159, "pages": {"start": 10, "end": 11}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_087_chunk_0008", "next_id": "pdf_087_chunk_0010", "content_hash": "sha256:428c28855aa89885198a48444525aaaf2a74731190a5db446c04bbda578e7ec3"}
