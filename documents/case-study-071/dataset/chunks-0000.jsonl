Performance data was collected prior to the installation of PermaFrost NMR® to \nestablish a performance baseline.  After establishing a baseline, the chiller was treated  with the proper \namount and type of PermaFrost NMR® specially formulated for chiller systems. The installation of \nPermaFrost NMR® was made on the same day as the \nbaseline testing and required no downtime.  Six months \nlater, identical performance data was collected to determine \nthe impact of PermaFrost NMR®.  To isolate the effect of \ninstalling PermaFrost NMR®, the chiller’s operating \nparameters were adjusted to match those operating \nconditions of the baseline testing. \nDetailed data and a summary of the calculated \nimprovement in efficiency and increase in capacity are \nprovided in the tables on pages 4, 5 and 6 of this report.\nResults Summary\nFollowing treatment with PermaFrost NMR®, the chiller consumed 9.1% less electricity while \nsimultaneously producing 44% more cooling, thus achieving a 59% increase in COP. Additionally, the \nchiller showed a 28.6% improvement in “evaporator approach”, which is another measurable way to \nview the thermodynamic enhancement of PermaFrost NMR®.  The bottom line for Commercial Real Estate Developer is that the \ninstallation of PermaFrost NMR® creates a payback of under one year based on 3,500 hours of annual \noperating time.

This thermal degradation reduces the ability of the system to transfer heat effectively, thus reducing overall efficiency.  Almost every piece of HVAC equipment in the world experiences some degree of thermal efficiency loss over its operating life. Independent studies from the American Society of Heating, \nRefrigeration & Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) have concluded that thermal inefficiency can increase the \nelectricity consumption of any HVAC system by up to 30% within the first five years of the equipment’s life.  \nProduct Brief\n         PermaFrost NMR® is a nanotechnology that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR®) \ntechnology as its core agent to eliminate and reverse the effects of thermal inefficiency on HVAC equipment.  A \none-time treatment of PermaFrost NMR® will provide thermal efficiency protection for the remaining life of any \nrefrigerant system.  The manufacturer of  PermaFrost NMR®, Powertron Global®, has installed and \ntested PermaFrost NMR® in over 108,000 HVAC and refrigeration systems around the world and has \nexperienced energy reduction in direct expansion (DX), chiller (screw, reciprocating, scroll and \ncentrifugal), heat pumps, and ice making equipment. Specialized applications include computer room \ncooling and dehumidification systems, chiller plants (water and ice production applications), domestic \nand industrial refrigeration (ammonia low and ultra low temperature), air-cooled single application \nwater chillers, and split and package rooftop HVACR equipment.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® include improved cooling performance, increased capacity and \nimproved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point temperatures more \nquickly, which reduces compressor operating times. The indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced \nthermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, fewer kilowatt-hours \nused, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life and reduced carbon footprint.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 560, "chars": 2752, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_071_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_071_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:65f5218452da7e925d67ba60bdde8119ba883ef8c44607f2b5a797d6390d0402"}

The \nAssociation of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and \nAir-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the \nIPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation measures (ECM).\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize: \noptions A, B, C and D.  Powertron Global® used Retrofit Isolation Methodology (Option B) to develop this \nreport.   Option B is defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost \nNMR®) as the single source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy \nuse of the ECM affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by short-term \nmeasurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using \nmeasurements of proxies of energy use. \nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+ /- Routine Adjustments + /- Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 464, "chars": 2293, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_071_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_071_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:987b2781303796ad7a8384e796e2a50e7941d23a31a4f36f4e50a4c3691596ab"}

Baseline measurements were recorded and then the proper amount and type of \nPermaFrost NMR® was injected. The product was then allowed to work over the winter to “seat” itself into \nthe crystal lattice of the metal surfaces before post measurements were taken again to establish the efficiency \ngains. The “seating” period is usually four weeks. In this instance however, cooler late autumn \ntemperatures following installation limited the use of chiller, postponing the post-installation testing until \nwarmer temperatures warranted the demand for cooling in the building.  \nThe final calculations were performed by Powertron Global’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer, Edward R. \n[Senior Energy Engineer], FME/CEM/CMC/CMVP.

First, the annual cost is calculated to run the chiller at \nbaseline levels for 3,500 hours per year.\nkW Baseline = .47 kW/ton * 151 tons = 71kW\nAnnual kWh Baseline = 71kW * 3,500 hours = 248,500 kWh\nAnnual Cost Baseline = 248,500 kWh * .11 cents = $27,335\nThe next step is to adjust the tonnage from 151 tons to 218 tons to match the tonnage of the post installation test. \n        Adjusted Baseline Tonnage = 218 tons \n        Adjusted kW Baseline = .47 kW/ton * 218 tons = 102.5 kW\n        Adjusted Baseline kWh =  102.5 * 3,500 Annual Operating Hrs = 358,750 kWh\n        Revised Cost to Run Baseline = 358,750 kWh * $.11 = $39,463\nThe cost to run the chiller at 3,500 hours per year at 218 tons utilizing original baseline eﬃciency is calculated at \n$39,462 per year. \nThe cost of running the chiller at 218 tons utilizing the improved post installation eﬃciency derived from \neliminating thermal inefficiency:\n        kW ERP =  .30 kW/ton * 218 tons = 65.4 kW\n        Annual kWh ERP = 65.4 kW * 3,500 hours = 228,900 kWh\n        Annual Cost ERP = 228,900 kWh * .11 cents = $25,179\n        Annual Savings = $39,463- $25,179=$14,284\n        Monthly Savings = $14,284/12=$1,190\n        Finally, the estimated the time to payback the investment in PermaFrost NMR® is determined. With an \ninitial investment of $12,800 for the required amount of PermaFrost NMR® divided by the expected monthly \nsavings of $1,190, the simple payback period is 11 months.  \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\nEnergy Science Division\n9\nCertiﬁcation\n[Engineering Consultant], P.E., for EET reviewed all the raw data pertaining to this particular test and certifies to\nthe integrity of the data collected pre and post PermaFrost NMR® treatment and the accuracy of the \ncalculations.\n.\nPlace P.E.
