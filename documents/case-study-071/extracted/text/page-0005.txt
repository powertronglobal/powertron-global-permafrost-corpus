Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces. 
A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the unit’s operational 
conditions were satisfactory. Baseline measurements were recorded and then the proper amount and type of 
PermaFrost NMR® was injected. The product was then allowed to work over the winter to “seat” itself into 
the crystal lattice of the metal surfaces before post measurements were taken again to establish the efficiency 
gains. The “seating” period is usually four weeks. In this instance however, cooler late autumn 
temperatures following installation limited the use of chiller, postponing the post-installation testing until 
warmer temperatures warranted the demand for cooling in the building.  
The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer, Edward R. 
[Senior Energy Engineer], FME/CEM/CMC/CMVP. Wayne Myers, Operations Manager, Commercial Real Estate Developer Enterprises, witnessed the 
M&V.  [Engineering Consultant], P.E., and Randy Roy, both of Energy Efficient Technologies, oversaw the testing 
methodology. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase)
 
 
Operating Tons / Hour = (GPM x 8.34 x 60 x Chilled Water Delta) / 12,000
 
kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage
 
COP = (12 / kW per Ton / 3.412)
