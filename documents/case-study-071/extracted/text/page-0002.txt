PermaFrost NMR® Chiller Report
Commercial Real Estate Developer Enterprises
April 20, 2013
Executive Summary
        This report contains detailed information regarding the efficiency improvements gained from the 
installation of PermaFrost NMR® in a 300-ton chiller at Commercial Real Estate Developer Enterprises’ headquarters located at  20 M 
Street, Washington D.C. Performance data was collected prior to the installation of PermaFrost NMR® to 
establish a performance baseline.  After establishing a baseline, the chiller was treated  with the proper 
amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® specially formulated for chiller systems. The installation of 
PermaFrost NMR® was made on the same day as the 
baseline testing and required no downtime.  Six months 
later, identical performance data was collected to determine 
the impact of PermaFrost NMR®.  To isolate the effect of 
installing PermaFrost NMR®, the chiller’s operating 
parameters were adjusted to match those operating 
conditions of the baseline testing. 
Detailed data and a summary of the calculated 
improvement in efficiency and increase in capacity are 
provided in the tables on pages 4, 5 and 6 of this report.
Results Summary
Following treatment with PermaFrost NMR®, the chiller consumed 9.1% less electricity while 
simultaneously producing 44% more cooling, thus achieving a 59% increase in COP. Additionally, the 
chiller showed a 28.6% improvement in “evaporator approach”, which is another measurable way to 
view the thermodynamic enhancement of PermaFrost NMR®.  The bottom line for Commercial Real Estate Developer is that the 
installation of PermaFrost NMR® creates a payback of under one year based on 3,500 hours of annual 
operating time. Data tables and financial calculations are available for review at the end of this report.
