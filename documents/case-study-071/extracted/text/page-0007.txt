Energy Reporting Period
The identical IPMVP data recordings from the baseline were recorded on 4/17/13 using the same recently 
NIST calibrated devices to ensure measurement accuracy. Outside air temperatures in the baseline and post 
measurement periods were an identical 72 degrees. Additionally, the entering condenser water in both the 
baseline and post was 71 degrees and the electrical motor power was locked at 40% so no adjustments were 
made for weather. The measurements are as follows:
