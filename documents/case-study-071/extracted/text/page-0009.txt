Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to calculate an accurate payback for 
Commercial Real Estate Developer Enterprises for implementing this ECM.  First, the annual cost is calculated to run the chiller at 
baseline levels for 3,500 hours per year.
kW Baseline = .47 kW/ton * 151 tons = 71kW
Annual kWh Baseline = 71kW * 3,500 hours = 248,500 kWh
Annual Cost Baseline = 248,500 kWh * .11 cents = $27,335
The next step is to adjust the tonnage from 151 tons to 218 tons to match the tonnage of the post installation test. 
        Adjusted Baseline Tonnage = 218 tons 
        Adjusted kW Baseline = .47 kW/ton * 218 tons = 102.5 kW
        Adjusted Baseline kWh =  102.5 * 3,500 Annual Operating Hrs = 358,750 kWh
        Revised Cost to Run Baseline = 358,750 kWh * $.11 = $39,463
The cost to run the chiller at 3,500 hours per year at 218 tons utilizing original baseline eﬃciency is calculated at 
$39,462 per year. 
The cost of running the chiller at 218 tons utilizing the improved post installation eﬃciency derived from 
eliminating thermal inefficiency:
        kW ERP =  .30 kW/ton * 218 tons = 65.4 kW
        Annual kWh ERP = 65.4 kW * 3,500 hours = 228,900 kWh
        Annual Cost ERP = 228,900 kWh * .11 cents = $25,179
        Annual Savings = $39,463- $25,179=$14,284
        Monthly Savings = $14,284/12=$1,190
        Finally, the estimated the time to payback the investment in PermaFrost NMR® is determined. With an 
initial investment of $12,800 for the required amount of PermaFrost NMR® divided by the expected monthly 
savings of $1,190, the simple payback period is 11 months.
