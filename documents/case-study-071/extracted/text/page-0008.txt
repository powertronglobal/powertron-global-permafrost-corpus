The following are the final calculated performance measurements (detailed below the chart) after 
performing the regression analysis. Regression analysis is used to calculate the true energy savings resulting 
from the improvement in capacity and reduction in kW brought about by PermaFrost NMR®. Determining 
what the cost to run the chiller would have been when operating at the original energy consumption rates, 
but using the new tonnage level achieved in the post derives the true ROI. The adjusted baseline costs are 
then compared to the new costs to operate and to determine the true ROI available to Commercial Real Estate Developer Enterprises.
