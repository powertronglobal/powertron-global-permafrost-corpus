PermaFrost NMR® Chiller Report

Commercial Real Estate Developer Enterprises

April 20, 2013
Executive Summary

This report contains detailed information regarding the efficiency improvements gained from the

installation of PermaFrost NMR® in a 300-ton chiller at Commercial Real Estate Developer Enterprises’ headquarters located at  20 M

Street, Washington D.C. Performance data was collected prior to the installation of PermaFrost NMR® to

establish a performance baseline.  After establishing a baseline, the chiller was treated  with the proper

amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® specially formulated for chiller systems. The installation of

PermaFrost NMR® was made on the same day as the

baseline testing and required no downtime.  Six months

later, identical performance data was collected to determine

the impact of PermaFrost NMR®.  To isolate the effect of

installing PermaFrost NMR®, the chiller’s operating

parameters were adjusted to match those operating

conditions of the baseline testing.

Detailed data and a summary of the calculated

improvement in efficiency and increase in capacity are

provided in the tables on pages 4, 5 and 6 of this report.

Results Summary

Following treatment with PermaFrost NMR®, the chiller consumed 9.1% less electricity while

simultaneously producing 44% more cooling, thus achieving a 59% increase in COP. Additionally, the

chiller showed a 28.6% improvement in “evaporator approach”, which is another measurable way to

view the thermodynamic enhancement of PermaFrost NMR®.  The bottom line for Commercial Real Estate Developer is that the

installation of PermaFrost NMR® creates a payback of under one year based on 3,500 hours of annual

operating time. Data tables and financial calculations are available for review at the end of this report.

The Problem

During normal operation, heat transfer surfaces in HVAC systems can become less efficient over time. This thermal degradation reduces the ability of the system to transfer heat effectively, thus reducing overall efficiency.  Almost every piece of HVAC equipment in the world experiences some degree of thermal efficiency loss over its operating life. Independent studies from the American Society of Heating,

Refrigeration & Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) have concluded that thermal inefficiency can increase the

electricity consumption of any HVAC system by up to 30% within the first five years of the equipment’s life.

Product Brief

PermaFrost NMR® is a nanotechnology that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR®)

technology as its core agent to eliminate and reverse the effects of thermal inefficiency on HVAC equipment.  A

one-time treatment of PermaFrost NMR® will provide thermal efficiency protection for the remaining life of any

refrigerant system.  The manufacturer of  PermaFrost NMR®, Powertron Global®, has installed and

tested PermaFrost NMR® in over 108,000 HVAC and refrigeration systems around the world and has

experienced energy reduction in direct expansion (DX), chiller (screw, reciprocating, scroll and

centrifugal), heat pumps, and ice making equipment. Specialized applications include computer room

cooling and dehumidification systems, chiller plants (water and ice production applications), domestic

and industrial refrigeration (ammonia low and ultra low temperature), air-cooled single application

water chillers, and split and package rooftop HVACR equipment.

The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® include improved cooling performance, increased capacity and

improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point temperatures more

quickly, which reduces compressor operating times. The indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced

thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, fewer kilowatt-hours

used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life and reduced carbon footprint.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol

Powertron Global® used the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) to

collect and prepare the detailed pre- and post-installation performance data included in this report.  The

Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and

Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the

IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation measures (ECM).

There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize:

options A, B, C and D.  Powertron Global® used Retrofit Isolation Methodology (Option B) to develop this

report.   Option B is defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost

NMR®) as the single source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy

use of the ECM affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.

Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the

savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term

measurements are very useful when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by short-term

measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using

measurements of proxies of energy use.

The final computation follows the formula:

Energy Science Division

Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy

+ /- Routine Adjustments + /- Non-Routine Adjustments

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content

The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the

effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces.

A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the unit’s operational

conditions were satisfactory. Baseline measurements were recorded and then the proper amount and type of

PermaFrost NMR® was injected. The product was then allowed to work over the winter to “seat” itself into

the crystal lattice of the metal surfaces before post measurements were taken again to establish the efficiency

gains. The “seating” period is usually four weeks. In this instance however, cooler late autumn

temperatures following installation limited the use of chiller, postponing the post-installation testing until

warmer temperatures warranted the demand for cooling in the building.

The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer, Edward R.

[Senior Energy Engineer], FME/CEM/CMC/CMVP. Wayne Myers, Operations Manager, Commercial Real Estate Developer Enterprises, witnessed the

M&V.  [Engineering Consultant], P.E., and Randy Roy, both of Energy Efficient Technologies, oversaw the testing

methodology.

The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:

kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase)

Operating Tons / Hour = (GPM x 8.34 x 60 x Chilled Water Delta) / 12,000

kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage

COP = (12 / kW per Ton / 3.412)

Energy Reporting Period

The identical IPMVP data recordings from the baseline were recorded on 4/17/13 using the same recently

NIST calibrated devices to ensure measurement accuracy. Outside air temperatures in the baseline and post

measurement periods were an identical 72 degrees. Additionally, the entering condenser water in both the

baseline and post was 71 degrees and the electrical motor power was locked at 40% so no adjustments were

made for weather. The measurements are as follows:

Results

The following are the final calculated performance measurements (detailed below the chart) after

performing the regression analysis. Regression analysis is used to calculate the true energy savings resulting

from the improvement in capacity and reduction in kW brought about by PermaFrost NMR®. Determining

what the cost to run the chiller would have been when operating at the original energy consumption rates,

but using the new tonnage level achieved in the post derives the true ROI. The adjusted baseline costs are

then compared to the new costs to operate and to determine the true ROI available to Commercial Real Estate Developer Enterprises.

Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to calculate an accurate payback for

Commercial Real Estate Developer Enterprises for implementing this ECM.  First, the annual cost is calculated to run the chiller at

baseline levels for 3,500 hours per year.

kW Baseline = .47 kW/ton * 151 tons = 71kW

Annual kWh Baseline = 71kW * 3,500 hours = 248,500 kWh

Annual Cost Baseline = 248,500 kWh * .11 cents = $27,335

The next step is to adjust the tonnage from 151 tons to 218 tons to match the tonnage of the post installation test.

Adjusted Baseline Tonnage = 218 tons

Adjusted kW Baseline = .47 kW/ton * 218 tons = 102.5 kW

Adjusted Baseline kWh =  102.5 * 3,500 Annual Operating Hrs = 358,750 kWh

Revised Cost to Run Baseline = 358,750 kWh * $.11 = $39,463

The cost to run the chiller at 3,500 hours per year at 218 tons utilizing original baseline eﬃciency is calculated at

$39,462 per year.

The cost of running the chiller at 218 tons utilizing the improved post installation eﬃciency derived from

eliminating thermal inefficiency:

kW ERP =  .30 kW/ton * 218 tons = 65.4 kW

Annual kWh ERP = 65.4 kW * 3,500 hours = 228,900 kWh

Annual Cost ERP = 228,900 kWh * .11 cents = $25,179

Annual Savings = $39,463- $25,179=$14,284

Monthly Savings = $14,284/12=$1,190

Finally, the estimated the time to payback the investment in PermaFrost NMR® is determined. With an

initial investment of $12,800 for the required amount of PermaFrost NMR® divided by the expected monthly

savings of $1,190, the simple payback period is 11 months.
