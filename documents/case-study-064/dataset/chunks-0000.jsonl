Detailed forensic performance testing \n(outlined later in this report) was performed on the two nominal 6-ton CRAC units using R22 refrigerant. \nFollowing testing, the CRAC units were treated with the proper amount and type of the PermaFrost NMR\u00ae \ntechnology specially formulated for these types of systems.  Measurement and Verification (M&V) was \nconducted pre-installation and post-gestation \nThe improvement in efficiency and restored \ncapacity gained directly at the units was solely \nattributable to the PermaFrost NMR\u00ae ECM. \nThis is a result of the reversal of thermal inefficiency on \nheat exchange surfaces.  \nFollowing treatment with the PermaFrost \nNMR\u00ae technology, the CRAC units showed an \neffective net average 27.5% reduction in \nkW/ton based on the exact capacity measured \nin the baseline M&V and the post gestation \nM&V. With each of the 6-ton CRAC units \noperating at 100%, the units showed an \naverage 31.8% reduction in kWh while simultaneously producing an average increase in system efficiency of \n23.1%. Prior to the ECM, the units each produced an average of 4.12 tons of cooling. After the ECM, the \naverage tonnage produced increased to 5 tons. This 21.4% average capacity increase from the baseline \nperformance level led to an effective average increase in COP of 39.4%. All of these factors directly correlate \nto what Regional US Bank will realize in energy savings as they operate these CRAC units in the future under the \nsame parameters.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. \u00a9 Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 601, "chars": 2674, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_065_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:9bb5861693b283e0ab6f7754ca0b129d69b95ad046df3eb3bcbdcadf6ce76cc7"}

This is illustrated by the 21.4% increase in the enthalpy delta, \nwhich is a critical HVAC measurement used to determine the thermodynamic enhancement brought \nabout by the PermaFrost NMR\u00ae ECM.  The result of the ECM improvement is an ROI to Regional US Bank that is \nmeasured in months. The tables of data used to determine the financial payback are available for review \nat the end of this report. \n  \nProduct Brief\n         PermaFrost NMR\u00ae is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure \n(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR\u00ae lasts for the remaining life of any \ntype of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and \nequipment that PermaFrost NMR\u00ae has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); \nchilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia \nrefrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The \nequipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal \n(single and multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR\u00ae are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and \nimproved refrigerant velocity \u2013 all of which allow systems to achieve set point temperatures in a more \nrapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from the \nenhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW hours \nused, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced carbon footprint \nfor Regional US Bank.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. \u00a9 Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 571, "chars": 2673, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_065_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_065_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:65012021b7d2eb5099003237cdc3b39160b37318e1a43f5c33fdd2e51c87d1e8"}

The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating, \nRefrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization \n(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation \nmethods and products.\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is \ndefined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR\u00ae) as the single \nsource of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM \naffected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations \nusing measurements of proxies of energy use. \nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy \u2013 Reporting Period Energy\n+/ - Routine Adjustments +/ - Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. \u00a9 Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 445, "chars": 2210, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_065_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_065_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:0caddb676ed3fec815100817352d87912dce98d7244f6c209900e1783f465ec2"}

Baseline M&V were recorded on both units and then the \nproper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR\u00ae was injected. The gestation period for the Regional US Bank pilot \nwas 4 weeks on these particular units to allow them to achieve the required ~250 hours of runtime on each \nto ensure adequate performance improvement time. At the end of this gestation period, Post M&V results \nwere taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same or very similar \nentering air dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures. These are the two most critical measurements affected by \nthe weather. When analyzing the data, no adjustments for weather were necessary. \nThe following report produces the utilization of the International Performance Measurement and \nVerification Protocol (IPMVP) as the M&V plan.
