The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period of CRAC Units 1 & 2. 
PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for Regional US Bank
Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Regional US Bank for 
implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to account for the average 
amount of tonnage restored to both CRAC units. Once the average percentage of improvement in capacity is 
determined, the average kWh associated with both CRAC units in the Post is then reduced by the same percentage to 
account for the average reduced number of hours the CRAC units will be required to run in the future to maintain the 
same set points. The average cost to operate each of the CRAC units prior to introduction of the ECM is then compared 
to the newly obtained average cost to operate each of the CRAC units following the installation of the ECM to 
determine the estimated Payback Period for Regional US Bank.  
Baseline kWh         6.515 kW * 3,750 Annual Operating Hrs = 24,431.25 kWh
Cost to Run Baseline         24,431.25 kWh * $.10 = $2,443.13
Post ECM kWh         5.77 kW * 3,750 Annual Operating Hrs = 21,637.5 kWh
Revised kWh (based on 21.2% restored capacity)         21,637.5 kWh * (1 - .212) = 17,050.35 kWh
