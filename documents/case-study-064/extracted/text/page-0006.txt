Detailed Results for CRAC Units 1 & 2
System Description / Design Characteristics
These units provide critical cooling for the local Regional US Bank Data Center located on the 8th floor of the Regional US Bank 
facility located at 66 South Pearl Street, Albany, NY. Given the internal load from the Data Center year round, it 
is estimated that each of the units ran ~3,750 hours each per year prior to the ECM being implemented.  
Baseline and Post Measurements
The identical IPMVP following data points were recorded for Baseline and Post on 6/12/13 and 7/10/13 
respectively using recently NIST calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. The Return Air dry bulb 
and wet bulb temperatures entering the coil were very similar in both periods so no adjustments were made to 
the calculations. The measurements are as follows:
