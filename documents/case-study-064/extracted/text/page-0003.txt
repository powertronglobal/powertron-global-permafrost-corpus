Following treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, the two CRAC units also showed an 
average drop in Amps from 9.125 to 8.05, equating to a 11.8% reduction while at the same time the CRAC 
units were each producing more cooling. This is illustrated by the 21.4% increase in the enthalpy delta, 
which is a critical HVAC measurement used to determine the thermodynamic enhancement brought 
about by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result of the ECM improvement is an ROI to Regional US Bank that is 
measured in months. The tables of data used to determine the financial payback are available for review 
at the end of this report. 
  
Product Brief
         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure 
(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, 
one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any 
type of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and 
equipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); 
chilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia 
refrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The 
equipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal 
(single and multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and 
improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point temperatures in a more 
rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from the 
enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW hours 
used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced carbon footprint 
for Regional US Bank.
