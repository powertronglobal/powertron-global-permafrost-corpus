PermaFrost NMR® Eﬃciency Report

Regional US Bank

July, 2013
Executive Summary

This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure (ECM)

PermaFrost NMR® in the two CRAC (Computer Room Air Conditioning) units supporting the critical data

center in the Regional US Bank facility at 66 South Pearl Street, Albany, NY. Detailed forensic performance testing

(outlined later in this report) was performed on the two nominal 6-ton CRAC units using R22 refrigerant.

Following testing, the CRAC units were treated with the proper amount and type of the PermaFrost NMR®

technology specially formulated for these types of systems.  Measurement and Verification (M&V) was

conducted pre-installation and post-gestation

The improvement in efficiency and restored

capacity gained directly at the units was solely

attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.

This is a result of the reversal of thermal inefficiency on

heat exchange surfaces.

Following treatment with the PermaFrost

NMR® technology, the CRAC units showed an

effective net average 27.5% reduction in

kW/ton based on the exact capacity measured

in the baseline M&V and the post gestation

M&V. With each of the 6-ton CRAC units

operating at 100%, the units showed an

average 31.8% reduction in kWh while simultaneously producing an average increase in system efficiency of

23.1%. Prior to the ECM, the units each produced an average of 4.12 tons of cooling. After the ECM, the

average tonnage produced increased to 5 tons. This 21.4% average capacity increase from the baseline

performance level led to an effective average increase in COP of 39.4%. All of these factors directly correlate

to what Regional US Bank will realize in energy savings as they operate these CRAC units in the future under the

same parameters.

Following treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, the two CRAC units also showed an

average drop in Amps from 9.125 to 8.05, equating to a 11.8% reduction while at the same time the CRAC

units were each producing more cooling. This is illustrated by the 21.4% increase in the enthalpy delta,

which is a critical HVAC measurement used to determine the thermodynamic enhancement brought

about by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result of the ECM improvement is an ROI to Regional US Bank that is

measured in months. The tables of data used to determine the financial payback are available for review

at the end of this report.

Product Brief

PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure

(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) technology as its core agent. A sustainable,

one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any

type of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and

equipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX);

chilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia

refrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The

equipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal

(single and multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.

The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and

improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point temperatures in a more

rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from the

enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW hours

used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced carbon footprint

for Regional US Bank.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol

The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) was utilized in the

development of this report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating,

Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization

(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation

methods and products.

There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They

are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is

defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single

source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM

affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.

Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the

savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term

measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by

short-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations

using measurements of proxies of energy use.

The final computation follows the formula:

Energy Science Division

Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy

+/ - Routine Adjustments +/ - Non-Routine Adjustments

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content

The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the

effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces.

A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the operational

conditions of the CRAC units were satisfactory. Baseline M&V were recorded on both units and then the

proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected. The gestation period for the Regional US Bank pilot

was 4 weeks on these particular units to allow them to achieve the required ~250 hours of runtime on each

to ensure adequate performance improvement time. At the end of this gestation period, Post M&V results

were taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same or very similar

entering air dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures. These are the two most critical measurements affected by

the weather. When analyzing the data, no adjustments for weather were necessary.

The following report produces the utilization of the International Performance Measurement and

Verification Protocol (IPMVP) as the M&V plan. [HVAC Technician], the Building Technology Company technician under

contract to [Facility Manager] at Regional US Bank and responsible for maintaining all of the HVAC in the facility,

witnessed the collection of all the data used in this report. The final calculations were performed by

Powertron Global’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer].

The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:

kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase)

BTUH = CFM * 4.5 (standard air) * Calculated Enthalpy Delta

kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage

Percentage Eﬃciency = Measured BTUH / Manufacturers Design BTUH

Coeﬃcient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)

Detailed Results for CRAC Units 1 & 2

System Description / Design Characteristics

These units provide critical cooling for the local Regional US Bank Data Center located on the 8th floor of the Regional US Bank

facility located at 66 South Pearl Street, Albany, NY. Given the internal load from the Data Center year round, it

is estimated that each of the units ran ~3,750 hours each per year prior to the ECM being implemented.

Baseline and Post Measurements

The identical IPMVP following data points were recorded for Baseline and Post on 6/12/13 and 7/10/13

respectively using recently NIST calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. The Return Air dry bulb

and wet bulb temperatures entering the coil were very similar in both periods so no adjustments were made to

the calculations. The measurements are as follows:

PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for Regional US Bank

Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Regional US Bank for

implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to account for the average

amount of tonnage restored to both CRAC units. Once the average percentage of improvement in capacity is

determined, the average kWh associated with both CRAC units in the Post is then reduced by the same percentage to

account for the average reduced number of hours the CRAC units will be required to run in the future to maintain the

same set points. The average cost to operate each of the CRAC units prior to introduction of the ECM is then compared

to the newly obtained average cost to operate each of the CRAC units following the installation of the ECM to

determine the estimated Payback Period for Regional US Bank.

Baseline kWh         6.515 kW * 3,750 Annual Operating Hrs = 24,431.25 kWh

Cost to Run Baseline         24,431.25 kWh * $.10 = $2,443.13

Post ECM kWh         5.77 kW * 3,750 Annual Operating Hrs = 21,637.5 kWh

Revised kWh (based on 21.2% restored capacity)         21,637.5 kWh * (1 - .212) = 17,050.35 kWh
