═══ METHODOLOGY ═══
Measurement Methodology
========================================

Data Type: Time Series
Total Measurements: 254,427

Source Data Files:
  - 597 kWh baseline_extended.xlsx: 65,363 rows (baseline period)
  - 597 kWh post EXTENDED.xlsx: 189,034 rows (post period)
  - Major Telecom A 597 - Meter1_kWh_by_Temperature_Bins.xlsx: 30 rows (unknown period)

Measurement Protocol
----------------------------------------
This study follows the International Performance Measurement & Verification Protocol (IPMVP)
for collecting and analyzing HVAC performance data. Key metrics measured include:

  - Coefficient of Performance (COP)
  - Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER)
  - Power consumption (kW)
  - Cooling capacity (Tons)
  - kW per Ton efficiency
  - Outdoor air temperature
  - Chilled water flow rate (GPM)
  - Chilled water delta temperature

Measurements were collected at 2-second intervals using calibrated sensors
to capture transient system behavior and ensure statistical significance.
