Highlights of the study:
• The three HVAC systems tested ranged in age from 7 to 14 years respectively with the average age 
being 10.5 years in service. When initially tested the pilot systems were producing a combined 405.2 
tons of cooling. 350+ runtimes hours after installation, the cooling capacity jumped 6.9% to 433.1 tons. 
• The average cost to produce each ton of cooling on the pilot units dropped 11.7% from 1.28 kW/ton in 
the baseline to 1.13 kW/ton after installation.  
• The average Coefficient of Performance (COP) of the pilot systems improved 11.8% from an average 
of 2.79 in the baseline to 3.12 following installation. 
• The average initial payback period for the three pilot systems is 16.5 months.
