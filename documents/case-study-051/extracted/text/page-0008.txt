Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics 3 Chillers Combined
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the three pilot systems.
Avg. Baseline Energy Consumption
Avg. Baseline Capacity:  405.2
Avg. Adjusted kW Baseline:  1.28 kW/ton * 433.1 tons = 554.4 kW
Avg. Adjusted Baseline kWh:  554.4 kW * 3,000 Annual Operating Hrs = 1,663,200 kWh
Avg. Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 1,663,200 kWh * $.086 = $143,035
Avg. Post Energy Consumption
kW Post:  1.13 kW/ton * 433.1 tons = 489.4 kW
Annual kWh Post:  489.4 kW * 3,000 hours = 1,468,200 kWh
Annual Cost Post:  1,468,200 kWh * $.086 cents = $126,265
Avg. Savings per Year Per System
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year:  $143,035 - $126,265 = $16,770
Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $16,770 / 12 = $1,398
Payback Period
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in all three pilot cooling systems: $23,125
Estimated ROI Period for Community Center A when treating all three pilot cooling systems: $23,125 / $1,398 = ~16.5 Months
Return on Investment
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 73%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 363%
Explanation of Regression Analysis
Utilizing data collected during the pilot study, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Community Center A for 
implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy savings resulting 
from the improvement in both capacity and efficiency. Working together, these improvements reduce the annual kWh expended in 
the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the cooling systems was when operating at the 
original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the 
cooling systems at the same restored capacity after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the 
most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or load % at which the system will now operate 
due to the restored performance profile. This restored performance profile allows the cooling systems to satisfy the internal area 
set point with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
