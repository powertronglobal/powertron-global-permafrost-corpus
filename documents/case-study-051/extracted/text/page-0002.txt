Study Overview
This report details the results of the recently completed comprehensive energy performance study conducted at 
Community Center A located in Sugarland, TX.
Running from July 26 to September 21, 2015, the pilot was designed to illustrate the positive impact the 
PermaFrost NMR® energy control measure (ECM) would have on the overall cooling performance of common 
types of cooling units supporting the Community Center A campus. Three air-cooled chillers systems were tested.
As demonstrated in this field trial, PermaFrost NMR® restores the capacity lost over time due to fouling of the 
heat exchange surfaces. This improvement in thermal performance will manifest itself in any or all of the 
following ways:
 
• Restored additional capacity to better satisfy fluctuating building or operational loads  
 
• Additional critical HVAC redundancy at no extra cost or interruption to facility operations
 
• Improved system efficiency, lowering cost to produce each ton of cooling required (i.e., kW/ton)
 
• Restored thermal efficiency allowing system to achieve thermostat set points faster, reducing 
 
    runtime (i.e., kWh) and extending useful equipment life an average of 15% 
The improvements demonstrated in this or any field test resulting from PermaFrost NMR® are dependent on 
factors such as age, condition, service history, runtime of one or both compressors and the design and 
application of each unit. The results in this pilot were consistent with historical performance averages.
