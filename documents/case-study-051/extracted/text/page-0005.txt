Methodology
After verifying the GPM of the evaporator before beginning each phase of the pilot, the subsequent 
measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected using AHRI Standard 550/590 and compiled in 
accordance with Option B of the IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. 
The results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic 
engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• kW/ton = Actual Measured Energy / Actual Measured Capacity 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = 12 / (kW/ton) /3.412
 
• Actual Cooling Capacity per Hour = Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU
Recovered Unit Cost with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
The kW/ton is the standard Unit Cost in the HVAC 
industry. It is the HVAC industry’s standard of 
determining how much energy is required to create 1 ton 
of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you reduce your 
unit cost of cooling you are saving regardless of how 
much cooling is required.
The chart to the right illustrates the average amount of 
efficiency restoration the ECM created in the pilot system 
after being installed. This degradation in operational 
efficiency is costing Community Center A a substantial amount of money 
in wasted energy.  As the last chart clearly illustrates, the 
treated pilot systems are currently performing on average 
of 11.6% more efficiently.
