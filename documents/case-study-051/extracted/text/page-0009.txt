Capital Improvements Detail
The capacity recovered after the PermaFrost NMR® treatment has substantial capital benefits including cost 
avoidance, deferred capital expense, and capital improvement in addition to the reduced energy cost to run the 
systems. These are instantaneous benefits realized at installation.
Treating the HVAC system with PermaFrost NMR® allows Community Center A to realize the following 
ﬁnancial beneﬁts: 
 
1. Restoration of 27.9 tons of HVAC Capacity. (Current rate to purchase commercial rooftop HVAC 
 
    capacity is ~ $500-800 per ton installed). 
 
2. Deferred Capital Cost. (Extending the remaining useful life of HVAC equipment will defer capital 
 
    cost of replacement. Using ten years (50%) service life remaining, the systems will experience an 
 
    estimated 2 years of additional service life, deferring replacement costs by 20%).
