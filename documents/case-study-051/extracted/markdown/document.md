Study Overview

This report details the results of the recently completed comprehensive energy performance study conducted at

Community Center A located in Sugarland, TX.

Running from July 26 to September 21, 2015, the pilot was designed to illustrate the positive impact the

PermaFrost NMR® energy control measure (ECM) would have on the overall cooling performance of common

types of cooling units supporting the Community Center A campus. Three air-cooled chillers systems were tested.

As demonstrated in this field trial, PermaFrost NMR® restores the capacity lost over time due to fouling of the

heat exchange surfaces. This improvement in thermal performance will manifest itself in any or all of the

following ways:

• Restored additional capacity to better satisfy fluctuating building or operational loads

• Additional critical HVAC redundancy at no extra cost or interruption to facility operations

• Improved system efficiency, lowering cost to produce each ton of cooling required (i.e., kW/ton)

• Restored thermal efficiency allowing system to achieve thermostat set points faster, reducing

runtime (i.e., kWh) and extending useful equipment life an average of 15%

The improvements demonstrated in this or any field test resulting from PermaFrost NMR® are dependent on

factors such as age, condition, service history, runtime of one or both compressors and the design and

application of each unit. The results in this pilot were consistent with historical performance averages.

Objectives

The four key objectives for this jointly-conducted PermaFrost NMR® pilot study between Community Center A, BEST,

Energy Services Partner and the Powertron Global Engineering team were all achieved. They included:

1. Determine that the “as-is” capacity and efficiency of the three pilot systems supporting the

aforementioned Community Center A facilities had degraded after an average of 10.5 years in operation.

2. Demonstrate that a performance improvement in both tonnage and kW/ton occurred across all three

of pilot cooling systems after being installed with the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.

3. Demonstrate the ability of each of the units to deliver colder evaporator supply water after being

treated.

4. To support an effective business case for further deployments of the ECM within the Energy Services Partner

portfolio of customers, demonstrate financial benefits associated with efficiency improvements

realized over the duration of the study.

The multiple cooling systems involved in the study are recorded as follows:

HVAC Equipment Manufacturer, Mfg date: 2008, R134, Model RTAA1254 (chiller #1)

HVAC Equipment Manufacturer, Mfg date: 2001, R134, Model RTAC1554 (chiller #2)

HVAC Equipment Manufacturer, Mfg date: 2001, R134, Model RTAC1554 (chiller #3)

ECM Product Brief

Methodology

After verifying the GPM of the evaporator before beginning each phase of the pilot, the subsequent

measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected using AHRI Standard 550/590 and compiled in

accordance with Option B of the IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework.

The results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic

engineering formulas:

• kW = Volts * Amps * 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase)

• kW/ton = Actual Measured Energy / Actual Measured Capacity

• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = 12 / (kW/ton) /3.412

• Actual Cooling Capacity per Hour = Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU

Recovered Unit Cost with PermaFrost NMR® ECM

The kW/ton is the standard Unit Cost in the HVAC

industry. It is the HVAC industry’s standard of

determining how much energy is required to create 1 ton

of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you reduce your

unit cost of cooling you are saving regardless of how

much cooling is required.

The chart to the right illustrates the average amount of

efficiency restoration the ECM created in the pilot system

after being installed. This degradation in operational

efficiency is costing Community Center A a substantial amount of money

in wasted energy.  As the last chart clearly illustrates, the

treated pilot systems are currently performing on average

of 11.6% more efficiently.

Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics 3 Chillers Combined

The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR®

Post measurement period for the three pilot systems.

Avg. Baseline Energy Consumption

Avg. Baseline Capacity:  405.2

Avg. Adjusted kW Baseline:  1.28 kW/ton * 433.1 tons = 554.4 kW

Avg. Adjusted Baseline kWh:  554.4 kW * 3,000 Annual Operating Hrs = 1,663,200 kWh

Avg. Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 1,663,200 kWh * $.086 = $143,035

Avg. Post Energy Consumption

kW Post:  1.13 kW/ton * 433.1 tons = 489.4 kW

Annual kWh Post:  489.4 kW * 3,000 hours = 1,468,200 kWh

Annual Cost Post:  1,468,200 kWh * $.086 cents = $126,265

Avg. Savings per Year Per System

Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year:  $143,035 - $126,265 = $16,770

Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $16,770 / 12 = $1,398

Payback Period

Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in all three pilot cooling systems: $23,125

Estimated ROI Period for Community Center A when treating all three pilot cooling systems: $23,125 / $1,398 = ~16.5 Months

Return on Investment

Annual Internal Rate of Return = 73%

Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 363%

Explanation of Regression Analysis

Utilizing data collected during the pilot study, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Community Center A for

implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy savings resulting

from the improvement in both capacity and efficiency. Working together, these improvements reduce the annual kWh expended in

the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the cooling systems was when operating at the

original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the

cooling systems at the same restored capacity after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the

most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or load % at which the system will now operate

due to the restored performance profile. This restored performance profile allows the cooling systems to satisfy the internal area

set point with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.

Capital Improvements Detail

The capacity recovered after the PermaFrost NMR® treatment has substantial capital benefits including cost

avoidance, deferred capital expense, and capital improvement in addition to the reduced energy cost to run the

systems. These are instantaneous benefits realized at installation.

Treating the HVAC system with PermaFrost NMR® allows Community Center A to realize the following 
ﬁnancial beneﬁts:

1. Restoration of 27.9 tons of HVAC Capacity. (Current rate to purchase commercial rooftop HVAC

capacity is ~ $500-800 per ton installed).

2. Deferred Capital Cost. (Extending the remaining useful life of HVAC equipment will defer capital

cost of replacement. Using ten years (50%) service life remaining, the systems will experience an

estimated 2 years of additional service life, deferring replacement costs by 20%).

Community Center A is Saving More than Just Energy and Preserving Capital

By treating the pilot cooling systems with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the manner in which the systems are

currently being operated, Community Center A will save approximately 195,000 kWh per year and all the costs associated with

those savings. From an environmental impact standpoint, Community Center A will also benefit all the surrounding

communities in which they operate.  Imagine the positive environmental impacts of treating the rest of Community Center A

portfolio.

The 195,000 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 134 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from

being released or any of the following

Mechanical Balancing & Adjustments

The initial verification of the site operations included meeting with specific management personnel that were

familiar with the design, functionality and daily operation of the chiller plant and the HVAC Equipment Manufacturer Tracer energy

management system. The mechanical engineered drawings were reviewed and data from the mechanical

equipment schedules and sequence of operation were noted. Next the chiller plant was inspected and an initial

validation of chilled water flow rates thru each chiller was verified.

This flow test consisted of the measurement of the water pressure drop across the evaporator in feet, utilizing a

Dwyer wet manometer and comparing the obtained data to the design previously obtained from the “as built"

engineered drawings. Each of the chillers (3) the chilled water flow amounts were in excess of 20% above the

design. Excessive chilled water flow routinely will demonstrate poor chiller performance as a result of the lack

of fluid retention in the evaporator in the form of “off design” delta temperatures. This syndrome of low delta t

is a common trait found in chilled water circulating systems that cause excessive equipment operation, lack of

system capacity and higher electrical consumption.

We adjusted all chiller water flows to design prior to taking baseline data. Data obtained for test purposes and

or the defining of system capacity must first be commissioned to the manufacturers and engineer of records

design to accept as valid and useful, and virtually eliminates false positive or false negative input data which

would render a performance study non valid.

Commissioning the chilled water flow in each chiller created advantages unavaliable before. On a Sunday

morning when the worship center and bible study activities were under way (building was subjected to

substantial load) it was common for three chillers to be operational. After balancing and the installation of

PermaFrost NMR® this same load scenario is now handled by one chiller. Subsequently as a part of the daily

load profile when school is in session the one smaller 125 ton chiller is utilized in the early hours before schools

begins to pre condition the building. This chiller should continue to operate until about 10:30 when the outdoor

air temp begins to increase then one of the larger chillers will then be called to handle the afternoon load of the

facility. Additionally, the chillers now run in a modulated fashion versus the full loaded conditions before

adjustments. Therefore the kW per ton and the recovered system capacity is generating substantial reductions in

total system operating costs.

After successfully adjusting each chillers chilled water flow to design parameters, the baseline data was

recorded for each chiller at full load prior to the installation of PermaFrost NMR®. As per design PermaFrost

NMR® must be allowed to circulate throughout the refrigerant circuits for a period of 350 operational hours to

allow full gestation of the reaction characteristics of the technology.

After the gestation operating period, an additional data test period know as the AERP (avoided energy

reporting period), was recorded. This test was identical to the baseline data and included a revivification of the

chilled water flow of each chiller and identical outdoor air temperatures. Outdoor air temperature is especially

important for accuracy due to the chiller using air-cooled condensers. At the conclusion of the AERP test period,

one of the VAV system air handlers was “spot checked” to determine if the condition of excessive chilled water

flow was in evidence as it was with the chillers. Using the same technique for flow measurement the chilled

water flow was recorded and 18% over design for the cooling coil. It is worth noting that there are

thermometers, pressure gauges, pressure and temperature test points, shut off butterfly valves and Nexus style

water balancing valve assemblies, used in each air handler.

The air handler tested previously had the leaving chilled water cut off valve adjusted to a 3/4 closed position

and labeled as set for flow control while the actual water balancing valve was wide open. This condition was

reversed. The cutoff valve was opened to the full position and the balancing valve was adjusted to the design

pressure drop. Before this exercise began this air handler was not meeting the leaving air set point. After the

flow adjustment, the leaving air temperature began to drop. An adjacent air handler was identical in the setting

of chilled water flow. It is assumed that all air handlers for this facility are setup in this manner.

Listed below are a few engineering recommendations to further reduce energy use and improve the

functionality of the HVAC system and the interior environment.

Recommendations:

1. Employ the use of a reputable test and balance firm. The issues that should be achieved are balance all

of the air handlers water and air circuits. The water should be balanced to design for each air handler

with the control valves in the 100% open position. The airflow should be balanced to design with the

supply air fan in the full speed position with all VAV terminals in the open position. Note that the air

handler fans have variable speed drives on them.

(The duct static pressure may be low when all VAV terminals are fully open due to standard engineering

practice to employ a diversity factor within the design.)

2. When the air handlers are in the full speed category measure the pressure drop across the chilled

water-cooling coil.

3. Verify the operation of the outdoor air energy recovery ventilators. It is not known how many of these

that there are in this facility but they all need to be balanced.

Powertron Global’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer learned that the insulation for the chiller evaporators is being

replaced. It is recommended in the best interest of Community Center A balance the air and water in the air-handlers before the

insulation is replaced. The return on investment far supersedes the insulation project and, if the insulation

project is postponed until next year the prices to perform the work will be much lower in February.

Discussions are strongly suggested with the client representative responsible for the operation of the HVAC

systems after the balancing of the air handlers. These discussions will allow the discovery of new levels of

efficiency to be realized in the chiller plant that will allow full advantage from PermaFrost NMR®. After the

“field systems” referring to the air handlers are fully returned to the manufacturers and engineer of record

design flow of return air, outside air and chilled water, further analysis of the flow characteristics of the chiller

plant will require verification to determine if a flow reassessment is advantageous. This exercise is one of the

most important parts of the full benefit of the use of PermaFrost NMR®. Our thermal engineering expertise

allows our team of engineers to redevelop the usage profile of your systems chilled water usage to meet load

requirements and to develop complete enthalpy control of the internal environment. Resulting benefits will

further reduce the use of kW for the purpose of thermal performance delivery from the chiller plant to a fraction

of the original point of use that was being consumed before the application of the PermaFrost NMR® technology

process. Please contact us for further analysis and re-commissioning details.
