Three air-cooled chillers systems were tested.\nAs demonstrated in this field trial, PermaFrost NMR® restores the capacity lost over time due to fouling of the \nheat exchange surfaces. This improvement in thermal performance will manifest itself in any or all of the \nfollowing ways:\n \n• Restored additional capacity to better satisfy fluctuating building or operational loads  \n \n• Additional critical HVAC redundancy at no extra cost or interruption to facility operations\n \n• Improved system efficiency, lowering cost to produce each ton of cooling required (i.e., kW/ton)\n \n• Restored thermal efficiency allowing system to achieve thermostat set points faster, reducing \n \n    runtime (i.e., kWh) and extending useful equipment life an average of 15% \nThe improvements demonstrated in this or any field test resulting from PermaFrost NMR® are dependent on \nfactors such as age, condition, service history, runtime of one or both compressors and the design and \napplication of each unit. The results in this pilot were consistent with historical performance averages. \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 585, "chars": 2752, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_052_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:780ee2bda75a898943bd8b72c5fd08275e88884d005bd6ae72aa8cf5defbea5f"}

Working together, these improvements reduce the annual kWh expended in \nthe Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the cooling systems was when operating at the \noriginal energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the \ncooling systems at the same restored capacity after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the \nmost widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or load % at which the system will now operate \ndue to the restored performance profile. This restored performance profile allows the cooling systems to satisfy the internal area \nset point with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.\n \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 699, "chars": 2925, "pages": {"start": 7, "end": 8}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_052_chunk_0005", "next_id": "pdf_052_chunk_0007", "content_hash": "sha256:bbb2c721a50795cd698d2068079396a968be549d901b54bb4894beb4db957df8"}

The mechanical engineered drawings were reviewed and data from the mechanical \nequipment schedules and sequence of operation were noted. Next the chiller plant was inspected and an initial \nvalidation of chilled water flow rates thru each chiller was verified. \nThis flow test consisted of the measurement of the water pressure drop across the evaporator in feet, utilizing a \nDwyer wet manometer and comparing the obtained data to the design previously obtained from the “as built\" \nengineered drawings. Each of the chillers (3) the chilled water flow amounts were in excess of 20% above the \ndesign. Excessive chilled water flow routinely will demonstrate poor chiller performance as a result of the lack \nof fluid retention in the evaporator in the form of “off design” delta temperatures. This syndrome of low delta t \nis a common trait found in chilled water circulating systems that cause excessive equipment operation, lack of \nsystem capacity and higher electrical consumption. \nWe adjusted all chiller water flows to design prior to taking baseline data. Data obtained for test purposes and \nor the defining of system capacity must first be commissioned to the manufacturers and engineer of records \ndesign to accept as valid and useful, and virtually eliminates false positive or false negative input data which \nwould render a performance study non valid. \nCommissioning the chilled water flow in each chiller created advantages unavaliable before. On a Sunday \nmorning when the worship center and bible study activities were under way (building was subjected to \nsubstantial load) it was common for three chillers to be operational. After balancing and the installation of \nPermaFrost NMR® this same load scenario is now handled by one chiller. Subsequently as a part of the daily \nload profile when school is in session the one smaller 125 ton chiller is utilized in the early hours before schools \nbegins to pre condition the building. This chiller should continue to operate until about 10:30 when the outdoor \nair temp begins to increase then one of the larger chillers will then be called to handle the afternoon load of the \nfacility. Additionally, the chillers now run in a modulated fashion versus the full loaded conditions before \nadjustments. Therefore the kW per ton and the recovered system capacity is generating substantial reductions in \ntotal system operating costs.\nAfter successfully adjusting each chillers chilled water flow to design parameters, the baseline data was \nrecorded for each chiller at full load prior to the installation of PermaFrost NMR®. As per design PermaFrost \nNMR® must be allowed to circulate throughout the refrigerant circuits for a period of 350 operational hours to \nallow full gestation of the reaction characteristics of the technology.\n10\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 731, "chars": 3708, "pages": {"start": 10, "end": 11}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_052_chunk_0007", "next_id": "pdf_052_chunk_0009", "content_hash": "sha256:b5d97a9cb066a1d7c759e6162afddc0b3601f740903983610fb739521c2e8a77"}

This test was identical to the baseline data and included a revivification of the \nchilled water flow of each chiller and identical outdoor air temperatures. Outdoor air temperature is especially \nimportant for accuracy due to the chiller using air-cooled condensers. At the conclusion of the AERP test period, \none of the VAV system air handlers was “spot checked” to determine if the condition of excessive chilled water \nflow was in evidence as it was with the chillers. Using the same technique for flow measurement the chilled \nwater flow was recorded and 18% over design for the cooling coil. It is worth noting that there are \nthermometers, pressure gauges, pressure and temperature test points, shut off butterfly valves and Nexus style \nwater balancing valve assemblies, used in each air handler. \nThe air handler tested previously had the leaving chilled water cut off valve adjusted to a 3/4 closed position \nand labeled as set for flow control while the actual water balancing valve was wide open. This condition was \nreversed. The cutoff valve was opened to the full position and the balancing valve was adjusted to the design \npressure drop. Before this exercise began this air handler was not meeting the leaving air set point. After the \nflow adjustment, the leaving air temperature began to drop. An adjacent air handler was identical in the setting \nof chilled water flow. It is assumed that all air handlers for this facility are setup in this manner. \nListed below are a few engineering recommendations to further reduce energy use and improve the \nfunctionality of the HVAC system and the interior environment. \nRecommendations:\n1. Employ the use of a reputable test and balance firm. The issues that should be achieved are balance all \nof the air handlers water and air circuits. The water should be balanced to design for each air handler \nwith the control valves in the 100% open position. The airflow should be balanced to design with the \nsupply air fan in the full speed position with all VAV terminals in the open position. Note that the air \nhandler fans have variable speed drives on them. \n(The duct static pressure may be low when all VAV terminals are fully open due to standard engineering \npractice to employ a diversity factor within the design.) \n2. When the air handlers are in the full speed category measure the pressure drop across the chilled \nwater-cooling coil.\n 3. Verify the operation of the outdoor air energy recovery ventilators. It is not known how many of these \n that there are in this facility but they all need to be balanced. \n11\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\nPowertron Global’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer learned that the insulation for the chiller evaporators is being \nreplaced. It is recommended in the best interest of Community Center A balance the air and water in the air-handlers before the \ninsulation is replaced. The return on investment far supersedes the insulation project and, if the insulation \nproject is postponed until next year the prices to perform the work will be much lower in February.\nDiscussions are strongly suggested with the client representative responsible for the operation of the HVAC \nsystems after the balancing of the air handlers. These discussions will allow the discovery of new levels of \nefficiency to be realized in the chiller plant that will allow full advantage from PermaFrost NMR®. After the \n“field systems” referring to the air handlers are fully returned to the manufacturers and engineer of record \ndesign flow of return air, outside air and chilled water, further analysis of the flow characteristics of the chiller \nplant will require verification to determine if a flow reassessment is advantageous. This exercise is one of the \nmost important parts of the full benefit of the use of PermaFrost NMR®. Our thermal engineering expertise \nallows our team of engineers to redevelop the usage profile of your systems chilled water usage to meet load \nrequirements and to develop complete enthalpy control of the internal environment. Resulting benefits will \nfurther reduce the use of kW for the purpose of thermal performance delivery from the chiller plant to a fraction \nof the original point of use that was being consumed before the application of the PermaFrost NMR® technology \nprocess.
