PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for Global IT Services Provider
Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Dimension 
Data for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true 
energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This greater capacity reduces the runtime hours and in 
turn reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post. The true ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the 
units was when operating at their original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of tonnage and then 
subtracting the new cost to run the units at this same newly restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was 
installed. This regression calculation is the most scientific method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the 
units will now run due to their increased capacity which allows the units to reach set temperatures quicker and shut off 
sooner. 
For calculations below R10.00 = $1.00
Adjusted kWE Baseline        2.63 kWE/tonne * 30.8 tonnes = 80.9 kWE
Adjusted Baseline kWh        80.9 kWE * 4,000 Annual Operating Hrs = 323600 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline        323,600 kWh * R1.00 = R323,600
kW Post        1.78 kWE / tonne * 30.8 tonnes = 54.9 kWE
Annual kWh Post         54.9 kWE * 4,000 hours = 219,600 kWh
Annual Cost Post         219,600 kWh * R1.00 = R219,600
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Month       (R323,600 - R219,600) /12 = R8,667
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in pilot System        R114,000
Estimated Energy Savings Payback Period for Global IT Services Provider        R114,000 / R8,667 = 13.15 months
