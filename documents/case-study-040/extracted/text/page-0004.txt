Product Brief
         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure 
(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative® (NMR™) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, 
one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining useful life of 
any system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and 
equipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); 
chilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia 
refrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The 
equipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single 
and multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® in any type of HVACR system are improved cooling 
performance, increased capacity and improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to 
achieve set point temperatures in a more rapid fashion, or in the case of chillers, unload, all of which 
reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced 
thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW hours used, less 
amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time, and as depicted at the end of this 
document, a reduced carbon footprint for Global IT Services Provider across their portfolio.
