       Detailed Results for Global IT Services Provider Chiller
System Description / Design Characteristics
The pilot chiller provides cooling to the Global IT Services Provider Campus. Given the internal load of the facility and 
the lifetime run hours on the control panel, it is estimated that the system runs a minimum of ~4,000 hours 
or more each per year prior to the ECM being implemented.  
Baseline & AERP Measurements 
The identical IPMVP following data points were recorded for Baseline and AERP on 8 August 2013 and 8 
October 2013 respectively using recently calibrated devices by NIST (National Institutes of Standards and 
Technology) to insure measurement accuracy. Since the outside air temperature affecting the workload of 
the condensing unit associated with the pilot chiller was 5.2 degrees C higher in the AERP, industry 
standard adjustments were employed to account for the situation. The chiller also has a high amount of 
water flowing through it and pressure drops nearly twice that of design. The measurements are as follows:
