The beautiful sprawling business campus is owned \nand operated by Global IT Services Provider of South Africa. This particular HVAC Equipment Manufacturer air cooled chiller using R22 \nrefrigerant provides cooling for one of the many multi-story buildings making up the Campus. Detailed \nforensic performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the pilot chiller to determine \nits suitability for testing and its performance capability after 13 years in service. Following testing, the chiller \nwas treated with the proper amount and type of the PermaFrost NMR® technology specially formulated for \nthese types of machines. \nMeasurement and Verification (M&V) readings \nwere conducted pre-installation and post-gestation \nby the Service Director at Redbase Services cc \n(HVAC Equipment Manufacturer distributor) under the direction of Nick \nCaldwell, General Manager, Global IT Services Provider along \nwith their consulting company, AConsult. Ed \n[Senior Energy Engineer], Director of Engineering for Powertron \nGlobal® validated that all data was collected and \ncompiled in accordance with the IPMVP \n(International Measurement and Verification \nProtocol) framework. \nThe improvement in efficiency and restored \ncapacity gained directly at the chiller was solely \nattributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. This is \na result of the reversal of thermal inefficiency on heat \nexchange surfaces.

These field conditions also result in lower than design temperature deltas. \nHowever, this pilot is all about showing the delta effects resulting from improving the thermal dynamic \ncharacteristics of the chiller which are clearly evident in the data stated below.   \nFollowing treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, the chiller showed an effective 32.3% \nreduction in kWE/tonne based on the exact capacity measured in the baseline M&V and AERP M&V \nperiods when operating at 80% load. The effective annual kWh was reduced by 104,000 kWh, equating to a \n32.1% reduction, while simultaneously producing an average increase of 6.55 tonnes or 27%. Prior to the \nECM, the chiller produced 24.25 tonnes of cooling as measured in-situ. After the ECM, the average \ncombined tonnage produced increased to 30.8 tonnes. This 27% capacity increase from the baseline \nperformance levels in combination with other related improvements led to an effective increase in COP of \n47.8%. All of these factors directly correlate to what Global IT Services Provider will realize in energy savings as they \noperate this and the thirty-two other similar campus chillers in the future under similar parameters.\nFollowing treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, the chiller also showed a significant reduction \nin amp draw of 13.5% and a 25% reduction in the refrigeration approach while at the same time producing \nmore cooling. All the measurements mentioned combine to reflect the thermodynamic enhancement \nbrought about by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. The result of the ECM improvement is an ROI to Dimension \nData that is measured in just over one year. When the projected energy rebates are factored in, the ROI \ndrops to well under one year. The tables of data used to determine the financial payback are available for \nreview at the end of this report. \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 598, "chars": 2772, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_042_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_042_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:881818f92c68605f0fc9b1dac32a053804abd6222d6383d682110764dff1b90b"}

A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining useful life of \nany system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and \nequipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); \nchilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia \nrefrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The \nequipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single \nand multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® in any type of HVACR system are improved cooling \nperformance, increased capacity and improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to \nachieve set point temperatures in a more rapid fashion, or in the case of chillers, unload, all of which \nreduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced \nthermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW hours used, less \namp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time, and as depicted at the end of this \ndocument, a reduced carbon footprint for Global IT Services Provider across their portfolio.\nEnergy Science Division\nBOUNDARY LAYER\nOIL REMOVED\nBEFORE TREATMENT\nAFTER TREATMENT\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 478, "chars": 2252, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_042_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_042_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:b5777d5157c3d4a449a7066dfec28adc079e73bc7ec28b06f8475343750dbc66"}

The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The \nAmerican Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency \nValuation Organization (EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness \nof energy conservation methods and products. One of the key technical architects of the IPMVP is Dr. L.J. \nGrobler from South Africa. It is also the procedure approved by Eskom for determining energy rebates in \nHVACR (Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration). Eskom is the primary energy provider \nin South Africa.\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is \ndefined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single \nsource of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM \naffected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations \nusing measurements of proxies of energy use. \nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+ - Routine adjustments / + - Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 496, "chars": 2389, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_042_chunk_0003", "next_id": "pdf_042_chunk_0005", "content_hash": "sha256:c0ce089ce07aa646ec32d5d416a854a0af0bbe01f9fc272b152862772fe1d495"}

This greater capacity reduces the runtime hours and in \nturn reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post.
