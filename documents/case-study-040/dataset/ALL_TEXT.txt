PermaFrost NMR® Performance Report
Global IT Services Provider Campus - Chiller  
October, 2013 
Executive Summary
         This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure 
(ECM) PermaFrost NMR® into one of thirty-three HVAC Equipment Manufacturer chillers supporting the Global IT Services Provider Campus. 
Located at 52 Sloane Road in Sandton, Johannesburg. The beautiful sprawling business campus is owned 
and operated by Global IT Services Provider of South Africa. This particular HVAC Equipment Manufacturer air cooled chiller using R22 
refrigerant provides cooling for one of the many multi-story buildings making up the Campus. Detailed 
forensic performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the pilot chiller to determine 
its suitability for testing and its performance capability after 13 years in service. Following testing, the chiller 
was treated with the proper amount and type of the PermaFrost NMR® technology specially formulated for 
these types of machines. 
Measurement and Verification (M&V) readings 
were conducted pre-installation and post-gestation 
by the Service Director at Redbase Services cc 
(HVAC Equipment Manufacturer distributor) under the direction of Nick 
Caldwell, General Manager, Global IT Services Provider along 
with their consulting company, AConsult. Ed 
[Senior Energy Engineer], Director of Engineering for Powertron 
Global® validated that all data was collected and 
compiled in accordance with the IPMVP 
(International Measurement and Verification 
Protocol) framework. 
The improvement in efficiency and restored 
capacity gained directly at the chiller was solely 
attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. This is 
a result of the reversal of thermal inefficiency on heat 
exchange surfaces. As you read through this

report, it should be noted that as a result of excessive water flow through the chiller (45-50% higher than 
design) in both baseline period and avoided energy reporting period (AERP) the resulting pressure drops 
were nearly twice that of design. These field conditions also result in lower than design temperature deltas. 
However, this pilot is all about showing the delta effects resulting from improving the thermal dynamic 
characteristics of the chiller which are clearly evident in the data stated below.   
Following treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, the chiller showed an effective 32.3% 
reduction in kWE/tonne based on the exact capacity measured in the baseline M&V and AERP M&V 
periods when operating at 80% load. The effective annual kWh was reduced by 104,000 kWh, equating to a 
32.1% reduction, while simultaneously producing an average increase of 6.55 tonnes or 27%. Prior to the 
ECM, the chiller produced 24.25 tonnes of cooling as measured in-situ. After the ECM, the average 
combined tonnage produced increased to 30.8 tonnes. This 27% capacity increase from the baseline 
performance levels in combination with other related improvements led to an effective increase in COP of 
47.8%. All of these factors directly correlate to what Global IT Services Provider will realize in energy savings as they 
operate this and the thirty-two other similar campus chillers in the future under similar parameters.
Following treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, the chiller also showed a significant reduction 
in amp draw of 13.5% and a 25% reduction in the refrigeration approach while at the same time producing 
more cooling. All the measurements mentioned combine to reflect the thermodynamic enhancement 
brought about by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. The result of the ECM improvement is an ROI to Dimension 
Data that is measured in just over one year. When the projected energy rebates are factored in, the ROI 
drops to well under one year. The tables of data used to determine the financial payback are available for 
review at the end of this report.

Product Brief
         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure 
(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative® (NMR™) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, 
one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining useful life of 
any system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and 
equipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); 
chilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia 
refrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The 
equipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single 
and multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® in any type of HVACR system are improved cooling 
performance, increased capacity and improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to 
achieve set point temperatures in a more rapid fashion, or in the case of chillers, unload, all of which 
reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced 
thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW hours used, less 
amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time, and as depicted at the end of this 
document, a reduced carbon footprint for Global IT Services Provider across their portfolio.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol
The IPMVP was utilized in the development of this report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The 
American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency 
Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness 
of energy conservation methods and products. One of the key technical architects of the IPMVP is Dr. L.J. 
Grobler from South Africa. It is also the procedure approved by Eskom for determining energy rebates in 
HVACR (Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration). Eskom is the primary energy provider 
in South Africa.
There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They 
are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is 
defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single 
source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM 
affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term 
measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by 
short-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations 
using measurements of proxies of energy use. 
The final computation follows the formula:

Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces.
 
Following a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to 
determine the operational condition of the chiller was satisfactory, 
Baseline M&V was recorded on both the evaporator and compressor 
and then the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® was 
injected. The gestation period for the Global IT Services Provider pilot was seven 
(7) weeks. Prior to taking AERP measurements, systems need to 
achieve ~300 hours of runtime to ensure adequate performance 
improvement time. At the end of this gestation period, AERP M&V 
results were taken in the identical manner as in the baseline. When 
analyzing all of the baseline and AERP data it was discovered that the 
outside air temperature entering the condenser and affecting its 
performance was 5.2 degrees C higher in the AERP so standard 
adjustments were made to account for this common in-situ HVAC 
testing situation. 
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the 
M&V plan. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
kWE = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
Tonnes = (LPM * 0.585 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T) / 3520 (which equals 1 kWR) 
 
kWE /Tonne = kWE / Actual Tonnage 
 
Coeﬃcient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kWE per tonne /3.412)
Energy Science Division
The Redbase Service Manager (HVAC Equipment Manufacturer 
Distributor) collects critical IPMVP 
measurements using the latest, most 
accurate digital NIST calibrated testing 
equipment directly at the chiller as part of 
the scientific PermaFrost NRM® pilot.

       Detailed Results for Global IT Services Provider Chiller
System Description / Design Characteristics
The pilot chiller provides cooling to the Global IT Services Provider Campus. Given the internal load of the facility and 
the lifetime run hours on the control panel, it is estimated that the system runs a minimum of ~4,000 hours 
or more each per year prior to the ECM being implemented.  
Baseline & AERP Measurements 
The identical IPMVP following data points were recorded for Baseline and AERP on 8 August 2013 and 8 
October 2013 respectively using recently calibrated devices by NIST (National Institutes of Standards and 
Technology) to insure measurement accuracy. Since the outside air temperature affecting the workload of 
the condensing unit associated with the pilot chiller was 5.2 degrees C higher in the AERP, industry 
standard adjustments were employed to account for the situation. The chiller also has a high amount of 
water flowing through it and pressure drops nearly twice that of design. The measurements are as follows:

PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for Global IT Services Provider
Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Dimension 
Data for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true 
energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This greater capacity reduces the runtime hours and in 
turn reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post. The true ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the 
units was when operating at their original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of tonnage and then 
subtracting the new cost to run the units at this same newly restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was 
installed. This regression calculation is the most scientific method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the 
units will now run due to their increased capacity which allows the units to reach set temperatures quicker and shut off 
sooner. 
For calculations below R10.00 = $1.00
Adjusted kWE Baseline        2.63 kWE/tonne * 30.8 tonnes = 80.9 kWE
Adjusted Baseline kWh        80.9 kWE * 4,000 Annual Operating Hrs = 323600 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline        323,600 kWh * R1.00 = R323,600
kW Post        1.78 kWE / tonne * 30.8 tonnes = 54.9 kWE
Annual kWh Post         54.9 kWE * 4,000 hours = 219,600 kWh
Annual Cost Post         219,600 kWh * R1.00 = R219,600
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Month       (R323,600 - R219,600) /12 = R8,667
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in pilot System        R114,000
Estimated Energy Savings Payback Period for Global IT Services Provider        R114,000 / R8,667 = 13.15 months
