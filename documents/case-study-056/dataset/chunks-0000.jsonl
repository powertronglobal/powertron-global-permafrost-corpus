Meighan Blvd., [Alabama Location], AL. Performance data was collected prior \nto the installation of PermaFrost NMR® to establish a performance \nbaseline. After establishing a baseline, the chiller was treated  with the \nproper amount and type of the PermaFrost NMR® technology specially \nformulated for chiller systems. The installation of PermaFrost NMR® \nwas made on the same day as the baseline testing and required no \ndowntime.  Four weeks later, identical performance data was collected \nto determine the impact of PermaFrost NMR®. To isolate the effect of \ninstalling PermaFrost NMR®, the chiller’s operating parameters were \nadjusted to match those operating conditions of the baseline testing. \nDetailed data and a summary of the calculated improvement in efficiency and increase in capacity are \nprovided in the tables shown in this report. \nResults Summary\nEnergy Science Division\nImprovements\nOperating Tons / Hour\nkW / Ton\nCOP\nEvaporator Approach\n23.9%\n15.2%\n19.2%\n6.7%\nFollowing treatment with PermaFrost NMR®, the chiller \nproduced 108 more tons of cooling, equating to a 23.9% \nincrease in capacity.

Data \ntables and financial calculations are available for review at the end of this report.\nTechnology Brief\nThe Problem\nDuring normal operation, heat transfer surfaces in HVAC systems can become less efficient over time. This thermal degradation reduces the ability of the system to transfer heat effectively, thus reducing overall efficiency. Almost every piece of HVAC equipment in the world experiences some degree of thermal efficiency loss over its operating life. Independent studies from the American Society of Heating, \nRefrigeration & Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) have concluded that thermal inefficiency can increase the \nelectricity consumption of any HVAC system by up to 30% within the first five years of equipment life.  \nThe Solution\n        PermaFrost NMR® is a nanotechnology that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative® (NMR™) \ntechnology as its core agent to eliminate and reverse the effects of thermal inefficiency on HVAC equipment.  A \none-time treatment of PermaFrost NMR® will provide thermal efficiency protection for the remaining life of any \nrefrigerant system. The manufacturer of PermaFrost NMR®, Powertron Global®, has installed and tested \nPermaFrost NMR® in over 115,000 HVAC and refrigeration systems around the world and has experienced \nenergy reduction in direct expansion (DX), Chiller (screw, reciprocating, scroll and centrifugal), heat pumps, \nand ice making equipment. Specialized applications include computer room cooling and dehumidification \nsystems, chiller plants (water and ice production applications), domestic and industrial refrigeration \n(ammonia low and ultra low temperature), air-cooled single application water chillers, and split and \npackage rooftop HVACR equipment.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® include improved cooling performance, increased capacity and \nimproved refrigerant velocity--all of which allow systems to achieve set point temperatures more quickly, \nwhich reduces compressor operating times. The indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced \nthermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, fewer kilowatt hours used, \nless amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life and reduced carbon footprint.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 618, "chars": 3052, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_057_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_057_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:97d3aff207a43cdd20018a4ba56d1f3753d7ec5244462d6b5eeeabc2fd9d522c"}

The \nAssociation of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and \nAir-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the \nIPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation measures (ECM).\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize: \noptions A, B, C and D.  Powertron Global® used Retrofit Isolation Methodology (Option B) to develop this \nreport. Option B is defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost \nNMR®) as the single source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy \nuse of the ECM affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by short-term \nmeasurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using \nmeasurements of proxies of energy use.\nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Avoided Energy Reporting Period (AERP)\n      \n                     +/- Routine Adjustments +/- Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 470, "chars": 2360, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_057_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_057_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:08e014cb9a17421db953bd381185cc3fe1cae4c1b9dca60544dc14b686b6251e"}

The standard for chillers maintains proper design flow in the \nevaporator and condenser as well as static entering temperatures of 80 degrees for the condenser and 55 \ndegrees for the evaporator. Lower temperatures than this will create the effect of increased capacity such as \nthose that were present during this test.  Additionally, increased flow with lower temperatures will create a \nfalse positive of a chillers’ capacity. This is evident in the loss of performance and the inability of the chiller \nto produce the design delta T within the heat exchange vessels (evaporator and condenser).\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\nEnergy Science Division\nChilled Water Supply & Return Temps                         \nBaseline Motor Amp Fixed Load\nEvaporator Temperature\nChilled Water Supply & Return Temps\nAERP Motor Amp Fixed Load\nEvaporator Temperature\nBaseline Key Measurement Images\nAERP Key Measurement Images\nResults\nThe table below contains a comparison of the baseline and AERP performance data calculated* performance \nmeasurements. \nImprovements\nTotal Adjusted kW\nOperating Tons / Hour\nkW / Ton\nTotal Adjusted kWh\nCOP\nEvaporator Approach\n15.2% \n23.9%\n15.2%\n15.2%\n19.2%\n6.7%\nPost-Installation\n156.8\n560\n0.28\n595,840\n12.69\n15.4\nBaseline\n184.8\n452\n0.33\n702,240\n10.65\n16.5\n*see kWh calculations below\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 802, "chars": 3126, "pages": {"start": 6, "end": 8}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_057_chunk_0004", "next_id": "pdf_057_chunk_0006", "content_hash": "sha256:8fb5358167f248e875752f6335ba3d2957cefbe77b67739347d59b04215675f7"}
