PermaFrost NMR® Performance Report
Major Tire Manufacturer Chiller Report  
15 December, 2013 
Executive Summary
         This report contains detailed information regarding the efficiency 
improvements gained from the installation of PermaFrost NMR® in a 
nominal 400-ton chiller at Major Tire Manufacturer manufacturing facility located at  
922 E. Meighan Blvd., [Alabama Location], AL. Performance data was collected prior 
to the installation of PermaFrost NMR® to establish a performance 
baseline. After establishing a baseline, the chiller was treated  with the 
proper amount and type of the PermaFrost NMR® technology specially 
formulated for chiller systems. The installation of PermaFrost NMR® 
was made on the same day as the baseline testing and required no 
downtime.  Four weeks later, identical performance data was collected 
to determine the impact of PermaFrost NMR®. To isolate the effect of 
installing PermaFrost NMR®, the chiller’s operating parameters were 
adjusted to match those operating conditions of the baseline testing. 
Detailed data and a summary of the calculated improvement in efficiency and increase in capacity are 
provided in the tables shown in this report.

Following treatment with PermaFrost NMR®, the chiller 
produced 108 more tons of cooling, equating to a 23.9% 
increase in capacity. This capacity improvement led to a 
reduction in the kW/ton cost to operate of 15.2% and a 
subsequent 19.2% increase in COP. Additionally, the 
chiller showed a 6.7% improvement in “evaporator 
approach”, which is another measurable way to view the 
thermodynamic enhancement of PermaFrost NMR®.
