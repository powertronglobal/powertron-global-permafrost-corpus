Engineering Notes
According to AHRI (American Refrigeration Research Institute) which is the governing body of all HVACR 
equipment sold nationwide, HVACR capacity is categorized by a standard set of parameters before their 
capacity is advertised to the public. The standard for chillers maintains proper design flow in the 
evaporator and condenser as well as static entering temperatures of 80 degrees for the condenser and 55 
degrees for the evaporator. Lower temperatures than this will create the effect of increased capacity such as 
those that were present during this test.  Additionally, increased flow with lower temperatures will create a 
false positive of a chillers’ capacity. This is evident in the loss of performance and the inability of the chiller 
to produce the design delta T within the heat exchange vessels (evaporator and condenser).
