Payback Analysis
Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to calculate an accurate payback for Major Tire Manufacturer 
[Alabama Location] for implementing this ECM.  First, the annual cost is calculated to run the chiller at baseline levels for 3,800 
hours per year.
Adjusted Baseline Tonnage        560 tons 
Adjusted kW Baseline        .33 kW/ton * 560 tons = 184.8 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh         184.8 kW * 3,800 Annual Operating Hrs = 702,240 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline         702,240 kWh * $.06 = $42,134
The cost of running the chiller at 560 tons utilizing the improved post installation eﬃciency derived from 
eliminating thermal inefficiency:
kW AERP        .28 kW/ton * 560 tons = 156.8 kW
Annual kWh ERP        156.8 kW * 3,800 hours = 595,840 kWh
Annual Cost ERP        595,840 kWh * .06 cents = $35,750
Annual Savings         $42,134 - $35,750 = $6,384
Monthly Savings         $6,384/12 = $532
Finally, the estimated the time to payback the investment in PermaFrost NMR® is determined. With an initial 
investment of $8,550 for the required amount of  PermaFrost NMR® divided by the expected monthly savings of 
$532, the simple payback period is 16.1 months.
