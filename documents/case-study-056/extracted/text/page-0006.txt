System Description / Design Characteristics
This chiller provides the process cooling to the Major Tire Manufacturer manufacturing facility at 922 E. Meighan Blvd., 
[Alabama Location], AL and is expected to run approximately 3,800 hours per year. 
IPMVP Baseline & AERP Measurements  
On 10/31/2013, Mr. [Senior Energy Engineer] used NIST calibrated devices to collect the data in the table below regarding 
the operating conditions of the chiller to be tested. The identical IPMVP data recordings from the baseline 
were recorded on 12/2/13 using the same recently NIST (National Institute of Standards & Technology) 
calibrated devices to ensure measurement accuracy. Additionally, the entering condenser water in both the 
baseline and post was within .8 degrees and the electrical motor power was locked at 73% so no 
mathematical adjustments were made to the data. The measurements are as follows:
