Before installing PermaFrost NMR®, a diagnostic examination of the chiller was conducted  to determine if 
the unit was operating in a safe range. Baseline measurements were recorded and then the proper amount 
and type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected. The product was then allowed to work over a four week 
period to “seat” itself into the crystal lattice of the metal surfaces before post measurements were taken 
again to establish the efficiency gains.   
The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global®’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer, Edward R. 
[Senior Energy Engineer], CMVP. Aaron Graham, Facility Maintenance Manager, Major Tire Manufacturer [Alabama Location] and Ed Caswell, 
Regional Energy Manager, Major Tire Manufacturer North America both witnessed all phases of the M&V.  
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
Operating Tons / Hour = (GPM x 8.34 x 60 x Chilled Water Delta) / 12,000
 
kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage
 
COP = (12 / kW per Ton / 3.412)
