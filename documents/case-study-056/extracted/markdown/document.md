PermaFrost NMR® Performance Report

Major Tire Manufacturer Chiller Report

15 December, 2013

Executive Summary

This report contains detailed information regarding the efficiency

improvements gained from the installation of PermaFrost NMR® in a

nominal 400-ton chiller at Major Tire Manufacturer manufacturing facility located at

922 E. Meighan Blvd., [Alabama Location], AL. Performance data was collected prior

to the installation of PermaFrost NMR® to establish a performance

baseline. After establishing a baseline, the chiller was treated  with the

proper amount and type of the PermaFrost NMR® technology specially

formulated for chiller systems. The installation of PermaFrost NMR®

was made on the same day as the baseline testing and required no

downtime.  Four weeks later, identical performance data was collected

to determine the impact of PermaFrost NMR®. To isolate the effect of

installing PermaFrost NMR®, the chiller’s operating parameters were

adjusted to match those operating conditions of the baseline testing.

Detailed data and a summary of the calculated improvement in efficiency and increase in capacity are

provided in the tables shown in this report.

The bottom line for Major Tire Manufacturer is that the installation of PermaFrost NMR® creates a payback of 14-15

months based on 3,800 hours of annual operating time and a fully delivered cost per kWh of $.06. Data

tables and financial calculations are available for review at the end of this report.

Technology Brief

The Problem

During normal operation, heat transfer surfaces in HVAC systems can become less efficient over time. This thermal degradation reduces the ability of the system to transfer heat effectively, thus reducing overall efficiency. Almost every piece of HVAC equipment in the world experiences some degree of thermal efficiency loss over its operating life. Independent studies from the American Society of Heating,

Refrigeration & Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) have concluded that thermal inefficiency can increase the

electricity consumption of any HVAC system by up to 30% within the first five years of equipment life.

The Solution

PermaFrost NMR® is a nanotechnology that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative® (NMR™)

technology as its core agent to eliminate and reverse the effects of thermal inefficiency on HVAC equipment.  A

one-time treatment of PermaFrost NMR® will provide thermal efficiency protection for the remaining life of any

refrigerant system. The manufacturer of PermaFrost NMR®, Powertron Global®, has installed and tested

PermaFrost NMR® in over 115,000 HVAC and refrigeration systems around the world and has experienced

energy reduction in direct expansion (DX), Chiller (screw, reciprocating, scroll and centrifugal), heat pumps,

and ice making equipment. Specialized applications include computer room cooling and dehumidification

systems, chiller plants (water and ice production applications), domestic and industrial refrigeration

(ammonia low and ultra low temperature), air-cooled single application water chillers, and split and

package rooftop HVACR equipment.

The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® include improved cooling performance, increased capacity and

improved refrigerant velocity--all of which allow systems to achieve set point temperatures more quickly,

which reduces compressor operating times. The indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced

thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, fewer kilowatt hours used,

less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life and reduced carbon footprint.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol

Powertron Global used the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) to

collect and prepare the detailed pre- and post-installation performance data included in this report.  The

Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and

Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the

IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation measures (ECM).

There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize:

options A, B, C and D.  Powertron Global® used Retrofit Isolation Methodology (Option B) to develop this

report. Option B is defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost

NMR®) as the single source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy

use of the ECM affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.

Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the

savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term

measurements are very useful when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by short-term

measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using

measurements of proxies of energy use.

The final computation follows the formula:

Energy Science Division

Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Avoided Energy Reporting Period (AERP)

+/- Routine Adjustments +/- Non-Routine Adjustments

Before installing PermaFrost NMR®, a diagnostic examination of the chiller was conducted  to determine if

the unit was operating in a safe range. Baseline measurements were recorded and then the proper amount

and type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected. The product was then allowed to work over a four week

period to “seat” itself into the crystal lattice of the metal surfaces before post measurements were taken

again to establish the efficiency gains.

The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global®’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer, Edward R.

[Senior Energy Engineer], CMVP. Aaron Graham, Facility Maintenance Manager, Major Tire Manufacturer [Alabama Location] and Ed Caswell,

Regional Energy Manager, Major Tire Manufacturer North America both witnessed all phases of the M&V.

The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:

kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase)

Operating Tons / Hour = (GPM x 8.34 x 60 x Chilled Water Delta) / 12,000

kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage

COP = (12 / kW per Ton / 3.412)

IPMVP Baseline & AERP Measurements

On 10/31/2013, Mr. [Senior Energy Engineer] used NIST calibrated devices to collect the data in the table below regarding

the operating conditions of the chiller to be tested. The identical IPMVP data recordings from the baseline

were recorded on 12/2/13 using the same recently NIST (National Institute of Standards & Technology)

calibrated devices to ensure measurement accuracy. Additionally, the entering condenser water in both the

baseline and post was within .8 degrees and the electrical motor power was locked at 73% so no

mathematical adjustments were made to the data. The measurements are as follows:

Engineering Notes

According to AHRI (American Refrigeration Research Institute) which is the governing body of all HVACR

equipment sold nationwide, HVACR capacity is categorized by a standard set of parameters before their

capacity is advertised to the public. The standard for chillers maintains proper design flow in the

evaporator and condenser as well as static entering temperatures of 80 degrees for the condenser and 55

degrees for the evaporator. Lower temperatures than this will create the effect of increased capacity such as

those that were present during this test.  Additionally, increased flow with lower temperatures will create a

false positive of a chillers’ capacity. This is evident in the loss of performance and the inability of the chiller

to produce the design delta T within the heat exchange vessels (evaporator and condenser).

Payback Analysis

Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to calculate an accurate payback for Major Tire Manufacturer

[Alabama Location] for implementing this ECM.  First, the annual cost is calculated to run the chiller at baseline levels for 3,800

hours per year.

Adjusted Baseline Tonnage        560 tons

Adjusted kW Baseline        .33 kW/ton * 560 tons = 184.8 kW

Adjusted Baseline kWh         184.8 kW * 3,800 Annual Operating Hrs = 702,240 kWh

Revised Cost to Run Baseline         702,240 kWh * $.06 = $42,134

The cost of running the chiller at 560 tons utilizing the improved post installation eﬃciency derived from

eliminating thermal inefficiency:

kW AERP        .28 kW/ton * 560 tons = 156.8 kW

Annual kWh ERP        156.8 kW * 3,800 hours = 595,840 kWh

Annual Cost ERP        595,840 kWh * .06 cents = $35,750

Annual Savings         $42,134 - $35,750 = $6,384

Monthly Savings         $6,384/12 = $532

Finally, the estimated the time to payback the investment in PermaFrost NMR® is determined. With an initial

investment of $8,550 for the required amount of  PermaFrost NMR® divided by the expected monthly savings of

$532, the simple payback period is 16.1 months.
