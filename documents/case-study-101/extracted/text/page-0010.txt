The post DB temperature (71.5 deg. F) entering the coil was matched exactly to the baseline period (71.5 
deg. F). After matching this temperature the post readings were taken to ensure that the work the coil had 
to do was as similar to the baseline. Normalizing the post amperage was not required in this case due to the 
O.A.T. was the same during both measurement periods.
