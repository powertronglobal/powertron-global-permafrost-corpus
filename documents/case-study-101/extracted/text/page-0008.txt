Please note that the initial baseline and post energy report period BTUH capacities may not align with 
published manufacturers statements. This is due to the operating temperatures of the incoming and leaving 
evaporator air temperatures, rate of air flow and existing weather conditions at the time and date of the pilot 
test. However it is pertinent to note that all variables were either matched or normalized to focus on the delta of the 
performance change post test.
The following are the final calculated performance measurements after performing the regression analysis to 
account to the restored capacity brought about by PermaFrost NMR®.
Regression Analysis 
Adjusted Base Tonnage         10.11 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted Total Watts         1,208 WPT * 10.11 tons = 12,213 Total Watts
Adjusted Base kWh         (12,213 TW/1,000) * 5,110 Annual Operating hrs = 62,408 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM         62,408 kWh * $.13 = $8,113 USD
Post ECM kWh         (8,119 / 1,000) * 5,110 Annual Operating hrs = 41,488 kWh
Cost to Run After ECM         41,488 kWh * $.13 = $5,393 USD
Cost Savings per Month         ($8,113 - $5,393) / 12 = $227
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® @ $680 / $227 = 3 months
 
ROI = 3 months
