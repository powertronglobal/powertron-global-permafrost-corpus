Please note that the initial baseline and post energy report period BTUH capacities may not align with 
published manufacturers statements. This is due to the operating temperatures of the incoming and leaving 
evaporator air temperatures, rate of air flow and existing weather conditions at the time and date of the pilot 
test. However it is pertinent to note that all variables were either matched or normalized to focus on the delta of the 
performance change post test.
The following are the final calculated performance measurements after performing the regression analysis to 
account to the restored capacity brought about by PermaFrost NMR®.
Regression Analysis 
Adjusted Base Tonnage         5.85 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted Total Watts         2,425 Watts per Ton * 5.85 tons = 14,186 Total Watts
Adjusted Base kWh         (14,186 TW/1,000) * 5,110 Annual Operating hrs = 72,490 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM         72,490 kWh * $.13 = $9,424 USD
Post ECM kWh         (5,288 Watts/ 1,000) * 5,110 Annual Operating hrs = 27,022 kWh
Cost to Run After ECM         27,022 kWh * $.13 = $3,513 USD
Cost Savings per Month         ($9,424 - $3,513) / 12 = $493
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® @ $425 / $493 = .86 months
 
ROI = .86 months
