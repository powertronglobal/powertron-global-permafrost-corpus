The post DB temperature (78.6 deg. F) entering the coil was matched as close as possible to the baseline 
period (77 deg. F). After matching this temperature the post readings were taken to ensure that the work the 
coil had to do was as similar to the baseline. The post amperage was adjusted downward by 5.56% due to 
the O.A.T. was 7 deg. F warmer. Only 5 degrees was taken into account for this adjustment, as anything 2 
degrees or lower is within the factor of standard deviation and is not entered in the adjustment.
