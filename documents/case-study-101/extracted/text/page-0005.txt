Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content of the following report will demonstrate the effects of PermaFrost NMR®’s ability to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces. 
A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment is implemented to determine if the unit’s operational 
conditions are satisfactory. Baseline measurements will be recorded and then the proper amount and type 
of PermaFrost NMR® will be injected. The product will be allowed approximately 4 weeks to seat itself into 
the metal surfaces. At the end of this gestation period, post M&V results were taken in the identical manner 
as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same or very similar entering air temperatures and 
compressor discharge pressures. 
It was determined with MACSUB INC. that the units run approximately 5,110 hours annually at a kWh cost 
of .13 cents per kW.
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP International Performance Measurement and 
Verification Protocol as the M&V plan. The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global®’s 
Forensic Mechanical Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer].
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
 
kW = Volts X Amps * .9 Single Phase or 1.47 Three Phase / 1000
 
 
Btuh Capacity = Measured CFM X 4.5 * Calculated Enthalpy Delta 
 
 
System Eﬃciency % = Actual Coil Capacity Btuh / Nominal Coil Capacity Btuh
 
 
kW per Ton = Measured kW / Measured Tons
 
 
COP = 12 / kW per ton / 3.412
