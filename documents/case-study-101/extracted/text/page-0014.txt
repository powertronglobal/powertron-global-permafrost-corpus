Please note that the initial baseline and post energy report period BTUH capacities may not align with 
published manufacturers statements. This is due to the operating temperatures of the incoming and leaving 
evaporator air temperatures, rate of air flow and existing weather conditions at the time and date of the pilot 
test. However it is pertinent to note that all variables were either matched or normalized to focus on the delta of the 
performance change post test.
The following are the final calculated performance measurements after performing the regression analysis to 
account to the restored capacity brought about by PermaFrost NMR®.
Regression Analysis 
Adjusted Base Tonnage         5.52 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted Total Watts         1,174 Watts per Ton * 5.52 tons = 6480Total Watts
Adjusted Base kWh         (6,480 Watts / 1,000) * 5,110 Annual Operating hrs = 33,113 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM         33,113 kWh * $.13 = $4,305 USD
Post ECM kWh         (3,628 Watts / 1,000) * 5,110 Annual Operating hrs = 18,539 kWh
Cost to Run After ECM         18,539 kWh * $.13 = $2,410 USD
Cost Savings per Month         ($4,305 - $2,410) / 12 = $158
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® @ $340 / $158 = 2.2 months
 
ROI = 2.2 months
