PermaFrost NMR® Performance Report
Major Restaurant Chain - 3 FL Locations
June 20, 2013 
Executive Summary
         This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure 
(ECM) PermaFrost NMR® in the greater [Florida Location] area for MACSUB INC. Detailed forensic performance 
testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on three pieces of DX equipment at three different 
Major Restaurant Chain locations. 
Immediately following the baseline testing, the units were treated with the proper amount and type of 
PermaFrost NMR® product formulated for R-22 DX systems and R-410A systems. Since there were no other 
ECM’s going on during this pilot project, the improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained 
directly at the units is solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. The unit(s) now provides 
cooler/drier supply air while using less power. This greater operational efficiency is due to the restoration 
of the heat transfer ability of the evaporator and condenser coils.
Following the introduction of PermaFrost NMR® the equipment detailed in this forensic report 
demonstrated substantial increases in BTUH capacity as shown in the proficiency of increased enthalpy 
delta (the scientific method to measure thermal heat energy transfer), Coefficient of Performance and 
reduction in utilized Watts per Ton. The PermaFrost NMR® ECM improvements are correlated to a 
mathematical model to represent a confident ROI that is detailed by store within the report. Data tables and 
financial computation are included for verification of this claim.
