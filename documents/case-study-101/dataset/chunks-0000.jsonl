Detailed forensic performance \ntesting (outlined later in this report) was performed on three pieces of DX equipment at three different \nMajor Restaurant Chain locations. \nImmediately following the baseline testing, the units were treated with the proper amount and type of \nPermaFrost NMR® product formulated for R-22 DX systems and R-410A systems. Since there were no other \nECM’s going on during this pilot project, the improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained \ndirectly at the units is solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. The unit(s) now provides \ncooler/drier supply air while using less power. This greater operational efficiency is due to the restoration \nof the heat transfer ability of the evaporator and condenser coils.\nFollowing the introduction of PermaFrost NMR® the equipment detailed in this forensic report \ndemonstrated substantial increases in BTUH capacity as shown in the proficiency of increased enthalpy \ndelta (the scientific method to measure thermal heat energy transfer), Coefficient of Performance and \nreduction in utilized Watts per Ton. The PermaFrost NMR® ECM improvements are correlated to a \nmathematical model to represent a confident ROI that is detailed by store within the report. Data tables and \nfinancial computation are included for verification of this claim. \nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 518, "chars": 2468, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_099_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:779a07135ac7077df9a060ac0bab9672835f4fe2763f682e79c3199f63cf2493"}

A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any \ntype of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and \nequipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); \nchilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia \nrefrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The \nequipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single \nand multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and \nimproved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point temperatures in a more \nrapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from the \nenhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW hours \nused, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced carbon footprint \nfor MACSUB INC.\nEnergy Science Division\nBOUNDARY LAYER\nOIL REMOVED\nBEFORE TREATMENT\nAFTER TREATMENT\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 434, "chars": 2066, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_099_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_099_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:faa542349fc964ff0cd26cd9cba15042c29a10fc9d535e2510910fb1eb03f476"}

The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, \nRefrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization \n(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation \nmethods and products.\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Retrofit Isolation \n(Option B) is defined as: All parameter measurement with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as \nthe single source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the \nenergy conservation method affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the \nbaseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using \nmeasurements of proxies of energy use.\nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+ - Routine adjustments / + - Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 439, "chars": 2180, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_099_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_099_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:a76e96097d6f723a868a05cf7c948bcfa0f7ab98bdb00d637f3999df0d4afead"}

This is due to the operating temperatures of the incoming and leaving \nevaporator air temperatures, rate of air flow and existing weather conditions at the time and date of the pilot \ntest. However it is pertinent to note that all variables were either matched or normalized to focus on the delta of the \nperformance change post test.\nThe following are the final calculated performance measurements after performing the regression analysis to \naccount to the restored capacity brought about by PermaFrost NMR®.\nRegression Analysis \nAdjusted Base Tonnage         5.52 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)\nAdjusted Total Watts         1,174 Watts per Ton * 5.52 tons = 6480Total Watts\nAdjusted Base kWh         (6,480 Watts / 1,000) * 5,110 Annual Operating hrs = 33,113 kWh\nRevised Cost to Run Prior to ECM         33,113 kWh * $.13 = $4,305 USD\nPost ECM kWh         (3,628 Watts / 1,000) * 5,110 Annual Operating hrs = 18,539 kWh\nCost to Run After ECM         18,539 kWh * $.13 = $2,410 USD\nCost Savings per Month         ($4,305 - $2,410) / 12 = $158\nCost of PermaFrost NMR® @ $340 / $158 = 2.2 months\n \nROI = 2.2 months\nEnergy Science Division\nEﬃciency Improvements\nTotal Watts\nWatts per Ton\nBtuh Capacity\nSystem Eﬃciency %\nEnthalpy Delta\nCOP\n-44.1%\n -44.1%\n+103.3%\n+103.3%\n+103.3%\n+78.9%\nEnergy Reporting Period\n3,628\n657\n66,226\n138%\n13.07\n5.35\nBaseline\n6,480\n1,174\n32,581\n67.9%\n6.43\n2.99\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 1017, "chars": 3641, "pages": {"start": 12, "end": 14}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_099_chunk_0008", "next_id": "", "content_hash": "sha256:58b90f5b3f5e1c91a05c9f416e0ca41bb721d85b6c94a23779454da9d79c258e"}
