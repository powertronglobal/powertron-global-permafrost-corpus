PermaFrost NMR® Performance Report
Major Restaurant Chain - 3 FL Locations
June 20, 2013 
Executive Summary
         This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure 
(ECM) PermaFrost NMR® in the greater [Florida Location] area for MACSUB INC. Detailed forensic performance 
testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on three pieces of DX equipment at three different 
Major Restaurant Chain locations. 
Immediately following the baseline testing, the units were treated with the proper amount and type of 
PermaFrost NMR® product formulated for R-22 DX systems and R-410A systems. Since there were no other 
ECM’s going on during this pilot project, the improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained 
directly at the units is solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. The unit(s) now provides 
cooler/drier supply air while using less power. This greater operational efficiency is due to the restoration 
of the heat transfer ability of the evaporator and condenser coils.
Following the introduction of PermaFrost NMR® the equipment detailed in this forensic report 
demonstrated substantial increases in BTUH capacity as shown in the proficiency of increased enthalpy 
delta (the scientific method to measure thermal heat energy transfer), Coefficient of Performance and 
reduction in utilized Watts per Ton. The PermaFrost NMR® ECM improvements are correlated to a 
mathematical model to represent a confident ROI that is detailed by store within the report. Data tables and 
financial computation are included for verification of this claim.

Product Brief
         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure 
(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, 
one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any 
type of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and 
equipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); 
chilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia 
refrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The 
equipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single 
and multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and 
improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point temperatures in a more 
rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from the 
enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW hours 
used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced carbon footprint 
for MACSUB INC.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) is utilized in the 
development of this report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, 
Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization 
(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation 
methods and products.
There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They 
are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Retrofit Isolation 
(Option B) is defined as: All parameter measurement with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as 
the single source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the 
energy conservation method affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the 
baseline data.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term 
measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by 
short-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using 
measurements of proxies of energy use.
The final computation follows the formula:
Energy Science Division
Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy
+ - Routine adjustments / + - Non-Routine Adjustments

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content of the following report will demonstrate the effects of PermaFrost NMR®’s ability to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces. 
A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment is implemented to determine if the unit’s operational 
conditions are satisfactory. Baseline measurements will be recorded and then the proper amount and type 
of PermaFrost NMR® will be injected. The product will be allowed approximately 4 weeks to seat itself into 
the metal surfaces. At the end of this gestation period, post M&V results were taken in the identical manner 
as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same or very similar entering air temperatures and 
compressor discharge pressures. 
It was determined with MACSUB INC. that the units run approximately 5,110 hours annually at a kWh cost 
of .13 cents per kW.
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP International Performance Measurement and 
Verification Protocol as the M&V plan. The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global®’s 
Forensic Mechanical Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer].
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
 
kW = Volts X Amps * .9 Single Phase or 1.47 Three Phase / 1000
 
 
Btuh Capacity = Measured CFM X 4.5 * Calculated Enthalpy Delta 
 
 
System Eﬃciency % = Actual Coil Capacity Btuh / Nominal Coil Capacity Btuh
 
 
kW per Ton = Measured kW / Measured Tons
 
 
COP = 12 / kW per ton / 3.412

The post DB temperature (74.6 deg. F) entering the coil was matched as close as possible to the baseline 
period (74.5 deg. F). After matching this temperature the post readings were taken to ensure that the work 
the coil had to do was as similar to the baseline. The post amperage was adjusted downward by 2% due to 
the O.A.T. was 3.6 deg F warmer. Only 1.6 degrees was taken into account for this adjustment, as
anything 2 degrees or lower is within the factor of standard deviation and is not entered in the
adjustment.

Results
Please note that the initial baseline and post energy report period BTUH capacities may not align with 
published manufacturers statements. This is due to the operating temperatures of the incoming and leaving 
evaporator air temperatures, rate of air flow and existing weather conditions at the time and date of the pilot 
test. However it is pertinent to note that all variables were either matched or normalized to focus on the delta of the 
performance change post test.
The following are the final calculated performance measurements after performing the regression analysis to 
account to the restored capacity brought about by PermaFrost NMR®.
Regression Analysis 
Adjusted Base Tonnage         10.11 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted Total Watts         1,208 WPT * 10.11 tons = 12,213 Total Watts
Adjusted Base kWh         (12,213 TW/1,000) * 5,110 Annual Operating hrs = 62,408 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM         62,408 kWh * $.13 = $8,113 USD
Post ECM kWh         (8,119 / 1,000) * 5,110 Annual Operating hrs = 41,488 kWh
Cost to Run After ECM         41,488 kWh * $.13 = $5,393 USD
Cost Savings per Month         ($8,113 - $5,393) / 12 = $227
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® @ $680 / $227 = 3 months

The post DB temperature (71.5 deg. F) entering the coil was matched exactly to the baseline period (71.5 
deg. F). After matching this temperature the post readings were taken to ensure that the work the coil had 
to do was as similar to the baseline. Normalizing the post amperage was not required in this case due to the 
O.A.T. was the same during both measurement periods.
