Conclusion 
 
Upon detailed examination in a controlled chamber, the baseline measurements determined that the 
test unit showed a considerable amount of degraded capacity and efficiency loss per OEM design 
specifications.  
Following the baseline readings, 8 ounces of PermaFrost NMR (corresponding to nominal equipment 
design tonnage of the test unit) was injected into the evaporator section of the test unit while under load 
inside the controlled chamber. The test unit was then removed from the chamber and installed into a 
holding chamber where it was allowed to run at full load for 400+ hours. According to the OEM, this 
was the approximate amount of time the PermaFrost NMR chemical compound required to fully 
displace the lubricant from the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers and then absorb into these same 
metal surfaces to prevent a reoccurrence of the oil fouling condition.  
Subsequent to the 400+ hours of run time, the test unit was then reinserted into the test chamber to 
allow for data collection and analysis. The system showed a significant increase in capacity compared 
to the baseline.  With this increase in capacity came an equally significant improvement in efficiency of 
the test unit as measured in EER and condensate collected.
