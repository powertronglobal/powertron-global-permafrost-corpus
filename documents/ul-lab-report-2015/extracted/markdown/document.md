Purpose of Study 
 
The purpose of this study is twofold.  First, to verify the current capacity and efficiency of a seven-year 
old packaged roof top unit (RTU) in relation to original equipment manufacturer (OEM) design 
specifications.  Second, to demonstrate what, if any, material changes occur in this same unit after 
being treated with PermaFrost NMR.   
 
The identification of test unit is recorded as follows: 
 
2008 Trane, 7.5 Ton, R-22, 208/230 Volt-3 Phase, Model TSC090A3EGAZUB 
 
 
Preparation of the Unit for Testing 
 
Powertron Global delivered the test sample equipment to the UL test lab located at 801 Klein Rd. Suite 
200, [Texas Location], Texas.   
UL unloaded and uncrated the test sample equipment and recorded all nameplate information, 
compressors, condenser fan motors, and the type and size of the evaporator and condenser coils.  
UL witnessed and/or took part in the preparation of the units in the staging area by the mechanical 
contractor, Lane Valente Refrigeration (LVR) before separately taking the unit into the test chamber. 
This included the following: 
-­‐ 
all heating elements and economizers being removed so as not to affect the test data (LVR) 
-­‐ 
refrigerant being recovered into its own vessel (LVR) 
-­‐ 
refrigerant being tested for acid content (LVR) 
-­‐ 
core driers being replaced to reduce the chance of creating a restriction during testing (LVR) 
-­‐ 
vacuum being pulled on the system down to 500 microns  for 30 minutes (LVR) 
-­‐ 
reclaimed refrigerant being reinstalled per nameplate (LVR) 
-­‐ 
external coils being inspected for cleanliness (LVR) 
-­‐ 
particulate return air filters being removed during the test (LVR) 
 
Testing Procedures 
After complete mechanical servicing and preparations, the test sample was installed inside the AHRI 
certified dual psychometric environmental test chamber. Next, the indoor and outdoor ductwork was 
built according to ASHRAE 37-2009 and installed on the test sample.  Transducers were then installed 
on the refrigerant lines to measure refrigerant pressures. Thermocouples were installed to provide 
refrigerant line temperatures for the purpose of calculating superheat. Airflow was measured and 
verified within 5% of a rate of 400 CFM per ton. The measurement methodology for air-flow included 
utilizing a NIST certified hot wire anemometer as defined per ASHRAE 37-2009 section

7.7, under the modified air flow measurement protocol and utilizing the air flow calculation stated in 
section 7.7.4 for standard air. 
The test sample was evaluated under the AHRI 340/360-2007 “Performance Rating of Commercial and 
Industrial Unitary Air-Conditioning & Heat Pump Equipment” test standard for performance and 
efficiency covering equipment ranging from 65,000 to 300,000 BTU’S.    
All electrical data was recorded using utility grade power meters during the three 10 minute test 
sessions. This same data is supplied with test results for each category.   
As previously stated, the test sample unit was set up and tested to provide a baseline when subjected to 
“Standard rating Test Conditions” according to AHRI 340/360 2007.  The unit was operated at full load 
test conditions per the standard to provide a 100% “A” test sequence. There were three 10-minute 
collection time segments at each of the test points (30-minutes total) and then all data was averaged.  
The key performance test points for the 7.5-ton sample were as follows: 
  
-­‐ 
Voltage and Amperage 
-­‐ 
EER 
-­‐ 
Entering evaporator air volume 
-­‐ 
Dry and wet bulb temperatures 
-­‐ 
Refrigerant pressures and temperatures 
-­‐ 
Condensate capture 
 
 
Summary Results 
 
Below is the resulting data recorded during the testing periods on the test unit under the previously 
identified AHRI standards.  The conditions for the 100% “A” test included standard with ambient 
environmental conditions at 95 degrees F dry bulb and 75 degrees F wet bulb and entering evaporator 
coil air temperature at 80 degrees F dry bulb and 67 degrees F wet bulb at 400 CFM per ton @ design 
static pressure.

Conclusion 
 
Upon detailed examination in a controlled chamber, the baseline measurements determined that the 
test unit showed a considerable amount of degraded capacity and efficiency loss per OEM design 
specifications.  
Following the baseline readings, 8 ounces of PermaFrost NMR (corresponding to nominal equipment 
design tonnage of the test unit) was injected into the evaporator section of the test unit while under load 
inside the controlled chamber. The test unit was then removed from the chamber and installed into a 
holding chamber where it was allowed to run at full load for 400+ hours. According to the OEM, this 
was the approximate amount of time the PermaFrost NMR chemical compound required to fully 
displace the lubricant from the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers and then absorb into these same 
metal surfaces to prevent a reoccurrence of the oil fouling condition.  
Subsequent to the 400+ hours of run time, the test unit was then reinserted into the test chamber to 
allow for data collection and analysis. The system showed a significant increase in capacity compared 
to the baseline.  With this increase in capacity came an equally significant improvement in efficiency of 
the test unit as measured in EER and condensate collected.
