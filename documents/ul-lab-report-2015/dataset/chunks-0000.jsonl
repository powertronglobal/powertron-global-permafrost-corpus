First, to verify the current capacity and efficiency of a seven-year \nold packaged roof top unit (RTU) in relation to original equipment manufacturer (OEM) design \nspecifications.  Second, to demonstrate what, if any, material changes occur in this same unit after \nbeing treated with PermaFrost NMR.   \n \nThe identification of test unit is recorded as follows: \n \n2008 Trane, 7.5 Ton, R-22, 208/230 Volt-3 Phase, Model TSC090A3EGAZUB \n \n \nPreparation of the Unit for Testing \n \nPowertron Global delivered the test sample equipment to the UL test lab located at 801 Klein Rd. Suite \n200, [Texas Location], Texas.   \nUL unloaded and uncrated the test sample equipment and recorded all nameplate information, \ncompressors, condenser fan motors, and the type and size of the evaporator and condenser coils.  \nUL witnessed and/or took part in the preparation of the units in the staging area by the mechanical \ncontractor, Lane Valente Refrigeration (LVR) before separately taking the unit into the test chamber. \nThis included the following: \n-­‐ \nall heating elements and economizers being removed so as not to affect the test data (LVR) \n-­‐ \nrefrigerant being recovered into its own vessel (LVR) \n-­‐ \nrefrigerant being tested for acid content (LVR) \n-­‐ \ncore driers being replaced to reduce the chance of creating a restriction during testing (LVR) \n-­‐ \nvacuum being pulled on the system down to 500 microns  for 30 minutes (LVR) \n-­‐ \nreclaimed refrigerant being reinstalled per nameplate (LVR) \n-­‐ \nexternal coils being inspected for cleanliness (LVR) \n-­‐ \nparticulate return air filters being removed during the test (LVR) \n \nTesting Procedures \nAfter complete mechanical servicing and preparations, the test sample was installed inside the AHRI \ncertified dual psychometric environmental test chamber. Next, the indoor and outdoor ductwork was \nbuilt according to ASHRAE 37-2009 and installed on the test sample.  Transducers were then installed \non the refrigerant lines to measure refrigerant pressures. Thermocouples were installed to provide \nrefrigerant line temperatures for the purpose of calculating superheat. Airflow was measured and \nverified within 5% of a rate of 400 CFM per ton. The measurement methodology for air-flow included \nutilizing a NIST certified hot wire anemometer as defined per ASHRAE 37-2009 section", "tokens": 726, "chars": 2998, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_020_chunk_0001", "next_id": "dataroom_020_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:264cadc3dd6acd4319766d91515e8a61ae210272436267f3b4cf2ea45e5fafc6"}

This same data is supplied with test results for each category.   \nAs previously stated, the test sample unit was set up and tested to provide a baseline when subjected to \n“Standard rating Test Conditions” according to AHRI 340/360 2007.  The unit was operated at full load \ntest conditions per the standard to provide a 100% “A” test sequence. There were three 10-minute \ncollection time segments at each of the test points (30-minutes total) and then all data was averaged.  \nThe key performance test points for the 7.5-ton sample were as follows: \n  \n-­‐ \nVoltage and Amperage \n-­‐ \nEER \n-­‐ \nEntering evaporator air volume \n-­‐ \nDry and wet bulb temperatures \n-­‐ \nRefrigerant pressures and temperatures \n-­‐ \nCondensate capture \n \n \nSummary Results \n \nBelow is the resulting data recorded during the testing periods on the test unit under the previously \nidentified AHRI standards.  The conditions for the 100% “A” test included standard with ambient \nenvironmental conditions at 95 degrees F dry bulb and 75 degrees F wet bulb and entering evaporator \ncoil air temperature at 80 degrees F dry bulb and 67 degrees F wet bulb at 400 CFM per ton @ design \nstatic pressure.  \n \n \nTrane                \n7.5 Ton \nDesign \nActual (before PF) \n    Actual (after PF) \n% Difference \nBtuh \n90,000 \n64,796 \n77,060 \n18.9% \nkW \n8.74 \n9.97 \n9.68 \n2.9% \nTons \n7.5 \n5.40 \n6.42 \n18.9% \nEER \n10.3 \n6.50 \n7.96 \n22.5% \nkW/Ton \n1.165 \n1.846 \n1.510 \n18.2% \n   \n Condensate  \n \n-- \n \n       5.45 lbs  \n             6.79 lbs \n \n    24.6%", "tokens": 709, "chars": 2727, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_020_chunk_0002", "next_id": "dataroom_020_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:bc7bb9a4b322330a1961c7044123bc4a9adfd38f840a268b1d9083d11e9e90f1"}

The test unit was then removed from the chamber and installed into a \nholding chamber where it was allowed to run at full load for 400+ hours. According to the OEM, this \nwas the approximate amount of time the PermaFrost NMR chemical compound required to fully \ndisplace the lubricant from the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers and then absorb into these same \nmetal surfaces to prevent a reoccurrence of the oil fouling condition.  \nSubsequent to the 400+ hours of run time, the test unit was then reinserted into the test chamber to \nallow for data collection and analysis. The system showed a significant increase in capacity compared \nto the baseline.  With this increase in capacity came an equally significant improvement in efficiency of \nthe test unit as measured in EER and condensate collected.", "tokens": 572, "chars": 2134, "pages": {"start": 8, "end": 9}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_020_chunk_0007", "next_id": "", "content_hash": "sha256:6460b7e8921d35d39a3a03cc3841a5e172966344a74297dfd91079d790beb9d4"}
