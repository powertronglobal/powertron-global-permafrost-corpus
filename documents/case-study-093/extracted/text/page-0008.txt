PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for Major Financial Services Firm Oﬃce Park
Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Raymond 
James Office Park for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate 
the true energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This greater capacity reduces the runtime hours 
and in turn reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post. The true ROI comes from determining what the cost to run 
the units was when operating at their original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of tonnage and then 
subtracting the new cost to run the units at this same newly restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was 
installed. This regression calculation is the most scientific method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the units 
will now run due to their increased capacity which allows the units to reach set temperatures quicker and shut off sooner.
Adjusted kW Baseline        .759 kW/ton * 5.76 tons =4.37 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh        4.38 kW * 4380 Annual Operating hours = 19,184 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline        19,184 kWh * $ .1325 = $2,542
kW Post         .545 kW/ton * 5.76 tons = 3.13 kW
Annual kWh Post         3.13 kW * 4380 hours = 13,709 kWh
Annual Cost Post         13,709 kWh * $.1325 cents = $1,816
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Month        ($2,542 - $1,816)/12 = $61
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in pilot System        $600
Estimated Energy Savings Payback Period for this unit $600/ $61        10 months
