Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces. 
A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the operational 
conditions of the systems were satisfactory. Baseline M&V was recorded and then the proper amount and 
type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected directly into the suction side of the refrigerant loop. At the end of 
this gestation period, Post M&V results were taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special 
care to match the same or very similar outside air temperatures and entering DB air temperatures to assure 
repetition within the test format therefore no weather adjustments were required.
The following report produces the utilization of the International Performance Measurement and 
Verification Protocol (IPMVP) as the M&V framework for calculations. Brian Patrick of Major Financial Services Firm 
helped facilitate this pilot. Powertron Global’s Chief Science Officer and Forensic Mechanical Engineer, 
[Senior Energy Engineer] CSO, CMC, FME performed the final calculations.
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of .9/1000 (for Single Phase)
 
 
BTUH = CFM * 4.5 * Wet Bulb Enthalpy Delta
 
kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage
 
 
Percentage Eﬃciency = Measured BTUH / Manufacturers Design BTUH
 
Coeﬃcient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
 
Refrigerant Approach = Supply Air DB – Saturated Evaporator Temperature
