       Detailed Results for Unit #1   
System Description / Design Characteristics
This unit provides cooling for the customer service center. Given the geographical area, it is estimated that 
this unit runs ~4,380 hours per year prior to the ECM being implemented.
Baseline & Energy Reporting (Post) Periods
The identical IPMVP following data points were recorded for Baseline and Post on 8-13-13 and 11-19-13 
respectively using recently NIST traceable calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. The OAT in 
the baseline and post periods were almost identical therefore no weather adjustments were necessary due to 
the standard deviation +/- 2 degrees. The measurements are as follows:
