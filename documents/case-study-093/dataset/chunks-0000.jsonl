Detailed forensic \nperformance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on this unit owned by Major Financial Services Firm \nOffice Park. Following testing, the unit was treated with the proper amount and type of the PermaFrost \nNMR® technology specially formulated for these types of systems.\nMeasurement and Verification (M&V) was conducted to establish an initial energy baseline and a post \navoided energy-reporting period. The purpose of the testing was to show how the ECM improves the \nthermal performance of any system it is installed in. The improvement in efficiency and restored capacity \ngained directly at each unit was solely attributable to PermaFrost NMR® ECM. This is a result of the \nreversal of thermal inefficiency on the heat exchanger surfaces.\nFollowing treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology the Aircoaire DX unit showed an effective net \naverage 28.2% reduction in kW/ton and an increase in capacity of 25.2%. The operating tonnage grew from \n4.6 tons to 5.76 tons. This capacity increase from the baseline performance level resulted in an effective \naverage increase in COP of 39.3%. All of these factors directly correlate to what the customer will realize in \nenergy savings as they operate this chiller in the future under the same parameters.\nFollowing treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, the refrigerant approach was also lowered \nfrom 21.8°F to 15.1°F. This represents a 30.7% improvement in approach, which is another measureable way \nto determine the thermodynamic enhancement brought about by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.\nThe result of the ECM improvements is an ROI to Major Financial Services Firm Office Park of 10 months. The tables of \ndata used to determine the financial payback are available for review at the end of this report.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 645, "chars": 2957, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_092_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:24086215a9b5a9bec8c4997559215e92fb04f30244cd0079a77f9db784bd8815"}

A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the life of any type of system \nin which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and equipment that \nPermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); chilled water systems \n(both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia refrigeration plants (single \ncompressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The equipment utilized in these \nsystems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single and multi-stage), scroll, \nreciprocating and screw configurations.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® in any type of HVACR system are improved cooling performance, \nincreased capacity and improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point \ntemperatures in a more rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits \nresulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, \nless kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced \ncarbon footprint for Major Financial Services Firm Office Park.\nEnergy Science Division\nBOUNDARY LAYER\nOIL REMOVED\nBEFORE TREATMENT\nAFTER TREATMENT\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 457, "chars": 2166, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_092_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_092_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:0e5c9532f1c2ad3652465504d3c1f9226fd9c410c5dd1510aa538bc37634b0a1"}

The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating, \nRefrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization \n(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation \nmethods and products.\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is \ndefined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM as the single source of \nmeasurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM affected \nequipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations \nusing measurements of proxies of energy use. \nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+/ - Routine adjustments  + /- Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 427, "chars": 2142, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_092_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_092_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:70ff3cc670407a10871a371ede888e6482438915671dc255f7ec0f3101292bf1"}

Baseline M&V was recorded and then the proper amount and \ntype of PermaFrost NMR® was injected directly into the suction side of the refrigerant loop. At the end of \nthis gestation period, Post M&V results were taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special \ncare to match the same or very similar outside air temperatures and entering DB air temperatures to assure \nrepetition within the test format therefore no weather adjustments were required.\nThe following report produces the utilization of the International Performance Measurement and \nVerification Protocol (IPMVP) as the M&V framework for calculations. Brian Patrick of Major Financial Services Firm \nhelped facilitate this pilot. Powertron Global’s Chief Science Officer and Forensic Mechanical Engineer, \n[Senior Energy Engineer] CSO, CMC, FME performed the final calculations.\nThe results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:\n \nkW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of .9/1000 (for Single Phase)\n \n \nBTUH = CFM * 4.5 * Wet Bulb Enthalpy Delta\n \nkW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage\n \n \nPercentage Eﬃciency = Measured BTUH / Manufacturers Design BTUH\n \nCoeﬃcient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)\n \nRefrigerant Approach = Supply Air DB – Saturated Evaporator Temperature\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\nEnergy Science Division\nMake\nModel\nSerial Number(s)\nRefrigerant Type\nNominal Cooling Capacity in Tons  \nAge\nArcoaire\nN2A348AKA200\nE071330938\nR-22\n4\n2007\n       Detailed Results for Unit #1   \nSystem Description / Design Characteristics\nThis unit provides cooling for the customer service center.
