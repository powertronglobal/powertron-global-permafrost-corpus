PermaFrost NMR® Performance Report
Major Financial Services Firm Oﬃce Park
November, 2013 
Executive Summary
         This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure 
(ECM) PermaFrost NMR® into one (1) DX unit located at 2401 West Bay Dr., Largo, FL. Detailed forensic 
performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on this unit owned by Major Financial Services Firm 
Office Park. Following testing, the unit was treated with the proper amount and type of the PermaFrost 
NMR® technology specially formulated for these types of systems.
Measurement and Verification (M&V) was conducted to establish an initial energy baseline and a post 
avoided energy-reporting period. The purpose of the testing was to show how the ECM improves the 
thermal performance of any system it is installed in. The improvement in efficiency and restored capacity 
gained directly at each unit was solely attributable to PermaFrost NMR® ECM. This is a result of the 
reversal of thermal inefficiency on the heat exchanger surfaces.
Following treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology the Aircoaire DX unit showed an effective net 
average 28.2% reduction in kW/ton and an increase in capacity of 25.2%. The operating tonnage grew from 
4.6 tons to 5.76 tons. This capacity increase from the baseline performance level resulted in an effective 
average increase in COP of 39.3%. All of these factors directly correlate to what the customer will realize in 
energy savings as they operate this chiller in the future under the same parameters.
Following treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, the refrigerant approach was also lowered 
from 21.8°F to 15.1°F. This represents a 30.7% improvement in approach, which is another measureable way 
to determine the thermodynamic enhancement brought about by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.
The result of the ECM improvements is an ROI to Major Financial Services Firm Office Park of 10 months. The tables of 
data used to determine the financial payback are available for review at the end of this report.

Product Brief
         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure 
(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative® (NMR™) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, 
one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the life of any type of system 
in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and equipment that 
PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); chilled water systems 
(both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia refrigeration plants (single 
compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The equipment utilized in these 
systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single and multi-stage), scroll, 
reciprocating and screw configurations.
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® in any type of HVACR system are improved cooling performance, 
increased capacity and improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point 
temperatures in a more rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits 
resulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, 
less kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced 
carbon footprint for Major Financial Services Firm Office Park.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) was utilized in the 
development of this report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating, 
Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization 
(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation 
methods and products.
There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They 
are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is 
defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM as the single source of 
measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM affected 
equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term 
measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by 
short-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations 
using measurements of proxies of energy use. 
The final computation follows the formula:

Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces. 
A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the operational 
conditions of the systems were satisfactory. Baseline M&V was recorded and then the proper amount and 
type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected directly into the suction side of the refrigerant loop. At the end of 
this gestation period, Post M&V results were taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special 
care to match the same or very similar outside air temperatures and entering DB air temperatures to assure 
repetition within the test format therefore no weather adjustments were required.
The following report produces the utilization of the International Performance Measurement and 
Verification Protocol (IPMVP) as the M&V framework for calculations. Brian Patrick of Major Financial Services Firm 
helped facilitate this pilot. Powertron Global’s Chief Science Officer and Forensic Mechanical Engineer, 
[Senior Energy Engineer] CSO, CMC, FME performed the final calculations.
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of .9/1000 (for Single Phase)
 
 
BTUH = CFM * 4.5 * Wet Bulb Enthalpy Delta
 
kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage
 
 
Percentage Eﬃciency = Measured BTUH / Manufacturers Design BTUH
 
Coeﬃcient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
 
Refrigerant Approach = Supply Air DB – Saturated Evaporator Temperature

PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for Major Financial Services Firm Oﬃce Park
Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Raymond 
James Office Park for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate 
the true energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This greater capacity reduces the runtime hours 
and in turn reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post. The true ROI comes from determining what the cost to run 
the units was when operating at their original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of tonnage and then 
subtracting the new cost to run the units at this same newly restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was 
installed. This regression calculation is the most scientific method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the units 
will now run due to their increased capacity which allows the units to reach set temperatures quicker and shut off sooner.
Adjusted kW Baseline        .759 kW/ton * 5.76 tons =4.37 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh        4.38 kW * 4380 Annual Operating hours = 19,184 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline        19,184 kWh * $ .1325 = $2,542
kW Post         .545 kW/ton * 5.76 tons = 3.13 kW
Annual kWh Post         3.13 kW * 4380 hours = 13,709 kWh
Annual Cost Post         13,709 kWh * $.1325 cents = $1,816
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Month        ($2,542 - $1,816)/12 = $61
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in pilot System        $600
Estimated Energy Savings Payback Period for this unit $600/ $61        10 months
