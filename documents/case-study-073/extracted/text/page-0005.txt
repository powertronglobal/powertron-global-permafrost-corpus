Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results 
Chiller Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Summit Hotels has the problem of thermal degradation in its Chillers and HVAC units. The lower operating 
tonnage and COP ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to 
operate numbers. The degraded equipment performance is costing Summit Hotel Properties significant money 
and wasting energy. The pilot chiller is using significantly more energy to operate than when it was new just 
four years earlier. 
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the chiller in the baseline and post 
testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® 
ECM resulted in a restoration of 8 operating tons and an average improvement of 32.6% in Coefficient of 
Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the chiller throughout the year.
The Carrier chiller treated has a nominal capacity of 143 tons at the given test conditions at 100% load and 308 
gallons per minute (GPM) flow through the evaporator.  The chiller was tested at ~85% load or 122 tons 
maximum capacity (5 of 6 compressors running), a GPM of 308, and outside air temperatures of 74 degrees.
