Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the Major Hotel Chain Courtyard Downtown Chiller.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 104 tons
kW Baseline (Adjusted): 1.47 kW/ton * 112 tons = 165 kW
Annual kWh Baseline: 165 kW * 3,235 Annual Operating Hrs = 533,775 kWh
Annual Cost Baseline: 533,775 kWh * $.082 = $43,770
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: 1.11 kW/ton * 112 tons = 124 kW
Annual kWh Post: 124 kW * 3,235 hours = 401,140 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 401,140 kWh * .082 cents = $32,893
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $43,770 - $32,893 = $10,877
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $10,877 / 12 = $906
Initial Payback Period
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot chiller: $16,000
Estimated ROI Period for Summit Hotel Properties on the chiller: $16,000 / $906 = 17.7 months
Annual Rate of Return = 68%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 340%
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for 
Summit Hotel Properties for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to 
calculate the true energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual 
kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller was when 
operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then 
subtracting the revised cost to run the chiller at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was 
installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours or 
load the chiller will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the chiller to reach the internal 
building set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
