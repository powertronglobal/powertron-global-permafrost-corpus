Recovered Wasted Energy with ECM - Chiller
The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration the PermaFrost NMR® ECM created in the 
treated chiller. The average cost to operate this chiller 
before it was treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as 
calculated in kW/ton, was 1.47.
The specific cost to operate this chiller after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, is currently 1.11.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ was 
expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate for a 
four year old chiller utilizing R410A refrigerant. The 
post results are also in line with the average 
improvement savings shown over more than 130,000 
installations globally.
