HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report
Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study
The purpose of this study is to verify the industry wide problem of efficiency loss in HVAC/R as projected by 
ASHRAE research and to quantify the amount of money wasted due to this loss. Many industry leading 
organizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age. 
Thermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVAC/R equipment that operates as a 
vapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well 
documented by the HVAC/R industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal 
degradation prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times 
and additional kWh consumption.
The chiller in this study (pictured below) is 
representative of a great majority of the 
portfolio of equipment operated by Summit 
Hotel Properties. If thermal degradation is 
present in this chiller it is present in the entire 
inventory of equipment. Energy waste can be 
calculated based on this equipment (portfolio 
representation) and then accurately 
extrapolated across the entire inventory of 
equipment.

Process
This report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of one of two chillers that 
support the Major Hotel Chain Courtyard Downtown Hotel in New Orleans, LA. 
Detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the pilot chiller before and after 
the installation of the ECM to determine the impact on the three key elements that greatly affect the hotel’s 
HVAC power bill as they relate to the original design specifications:
 
 
1.  The cooling capacity the chiller produces after 4 years in service, before and after the administration 
 
     of the ECM. 
 
2.  The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the chiller can deliver as 
 
     reflected in the kW/ton measurement, before and after the administration of the ECM. 
 
3.  The thermal dynamic ability of the chiller to perform in relation to operational design, before and 
 
     after the administration of the ECM.
Methodology
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the 
IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted of Larry 
Trowbridge and Jim Wogick, the Director and Asst. Director of Construction for Summit Hotel Properties; 
Major Hotel Chain’s New Orleans Director of Cluster Engineering, Phillip Lee; and Powertron Global’s Director of 
Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer].  
Notes
The equipment tested is common type of air-cooled chiller manufactured by Carrier.  Both the baseline and post 
measurements were taken with outside air temperatures of 74 degrees.  
The flow rate through the evaporator was set to exact design specifications in the baseline and post and the return chilled 
water entering the chiller in the baseline and post were identical so no adjustments were made.
The boundary of the testing was the chiller and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance 
calculations is very high.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the pilot chiller to perform prior to the 
PermaFrost NMR® (ECM) being installed, as well as illustrate the amount of thermal degradation due in large 
part to thermal degradation within the heat exchangers.
 
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
 
• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU 
 
• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Water Temp – Saturated Evaporator Temp (CH)
 
Notes
Following a diagnostic examination to determine the operational condition of the chiller was satisfactory, Baseline M&V 
data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. 400+ runtime hours after installation of the ECM, the M&V team 
returned on a very similar weather day to the Baseline to take Post M&V measurements in the identical fashion as in the 
Baseline and at the exact same outdoor air temperature. The delta of these measurements and associated calculations show 
the amount of capacity restored.
The following IPMVP data points were recorded on 26 September 2014 using the flow meter shown below, recently 
calibrated by NIST (National Institutes of Standards and Technology) to insure GPM measurement accuracy. The 
remaining measurements were taken directly from the chiller’s control panel. The chiller was then treated with 
PermaFrost NMR® on the same day and allowed to run normally until 22 April 2015 to ensure the patented surface 
science nanotechnology had ample time to 
seat into all the metal surfaces of the heat 
exchangers. All measurements were taken at 
similar incoming water temperatures as 
well as outdoor air temperatures. The 
collection of the data in both the baseline and 
post periods was witnessed by Major Hotel Chain 
Cluster Engineering and Powertron Global® 
and backed up by photos.

Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results 
Chiller Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Summit Hotels has the problem of thermal degradation in its Chillers and HVAC units. The lower operating 
tonnage and COP ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to 
operate numbers. The degraded equipment performance is costing Summit Hotel Properties significant money 
and wasting energy. The pilot chiller is using significantly more energy to operate than when it was new just 
four years earlier. 
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the chiller in the baseline and post 
testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® 
ECM resulted in a restoration of 8 operating tons and an average improvement of 32.6% in Coefficient of 
Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the chiller throughout the year.
The Carrier chiller treated has a nominal capacity of 143 tons at the given test conditions at 100% load and 308 
gallons per minute (GPM) flow through the evaporator.  The chiller was tested at ~85% load or 122 tons 
maximum capacity (5 of 6 compressors running), a GPM of 308, and outside air temperatures of 74 degrees.

Recovered Wasted Energy with ECM - Chiller
The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration the PermaFrost NMR® ECM created in the 
treated chiller. The average cost to operate this chiller 
before it was treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as 
calculated in kW/ton, was 1.47.
The specific cost to operate this chiller after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, is currently 1.11.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ was 
expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate for a 
four year old chiller utilizing R410A refrigerant. The 
post results are also in line with the average 
improvement savings shown over more than 130,000 
installations globally.

Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the Major Hotel Chain Courtyard Downtown Chiller.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 104 tons
kW Baseline (Adjusted): 1.47 kW/ton * 112 tons = 165 kW
Annual kWh Baseline: 165 kW * 3,235 Annual Operating Hrs = 533,775 kWh
Annual Cost Baseline: 533,775 kWh * $.082 = $43,770
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: 1.11 kW/ton * 112 tons = 124 kW
Annual kWh Post: 124 kW * 3,235 hours = 401,140 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 401,140 kWh * .082 cents = $32,893
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $43,770 - $32,893 = $10,877
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $10,877 / 12 = $906
Initial Payback Period
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot chiller: $16,000
Estimated ROI Period for Summit Hotel Properties on the chiller: $16,000 / $906 = 17.7 months
Annual Rate of Return = 68%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 340%
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for 
Summit Hotel Properties for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to 
calculate the true energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual 
kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller was when 
operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then 
subtracting the revised cost to run the chiller at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was 
installed. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours or 
load the chiller will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the chiller to reach the internal 
building set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.

Summit Hotel Properties is Saving More than Just Energy
By treating the pilot chiller with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the current manner in which the Summit Hotel 
Properties operates the Major Hotel Chain Courtyard Downtown chiller, it will save approximately 132,635 kWh per 
year and all the costs associated with those savings. From an environmental impact standpoint, Summit is 
also benefitting the surrounding community of downtown New Orleans. Imagine how great the 
environmental impact will be when Summit Hotel Properties moves forward with treating all their HVAC 
equipment in all their properties across the USA.
The 132,635 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 91.5 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from 
being released or any of the following:
