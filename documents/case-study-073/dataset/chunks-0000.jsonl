Many industry leading \norganizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age. \nThermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVAC/R equipment that operates as a \nvapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well \ndocumented by the HVAC/R industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal \ndegradation prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times \nand additional kWh consumption.\nThe chiller in this study (pictured below) is \nrepresentative of a great majority of the \nportfolio of equipment operated by Summit \nHotel Properties. If thermal degradation is \npresent in this chiller it is present in the entire \ninventory of equipment. Energy waste can be \ncalculated based on this equipment (portfolio \nrepresentation) and then accurately \nextrapolated across the entire inventory of \nequipment.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 554, "chars": 2580, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_075_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:93af0e96a1c693e03b71f19ff224754c57efab4c2735a8c99346366e8492e616"}

The cooling capacity the chiller produces after 4 years in service, before and after the administration \n \n     of the ECM. \n \n2.  The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the chiller can deliver as \n \n     reflected in the kW/ton measurement, before and after the administration of the ECM. \n \n3.  The thermal dynamic ability of the chiller to perform in relation to operational design, before and \n \n     after the administration of the ECM.\nMethodology\nThe measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the \nIPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted of Larry \nTrowbridge and Jim Wogick, the Director and Asst. Director of Construction for Summit Hotel Properties; \nMajor Hotel Chain’s New Orleans Director of Cluster Engineering, Phillip Lee; and Powertron Global’s Director of \nEngineering, [Senior Energy Engineer].  \nNotes\nThe equipment tested is common type of air-cooled chiller manufactured by Carrier.  Both the baseline and post \nmeasurements were taken with outside air temperatures of 74 degrees.  \nThe flow rate through the evaporator was set to exact design specifications in the baseline and post and the return chilled \nwater entering the chiller in the baseline and post were identical so no adjustments were made.\nThe boundary of the testing was the chiller and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance \ncalculations is very high.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 519, "chars": 2604, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_075_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_075_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:f020673707ab6c8da2bcec192d16e76462255ea08f0477cf89217c8812dbd19c"}

The delta of these measurements and associated calculations show \nthe amount of capacity restored.\nThe following IPMVP data points were recorded on 26 September 2014 using the flow meter shown below, recently \ncalibrated by NIST (National Institutes of Standards and Technology) to insure GPM measurement accuracy. The \nremaining measurements were taken directly from the chiller’s control panel. The chiller was then treated with \nPermaFrost NMR® on the same day and allowed to run normally until 22 April 2015 to ensure the patented surface \nscience nanotechnology had ample time to \nseat into all the metal surfaces of the heat \nexchangers. All measurements were taken at \nsimilar incoming water temperatures as \nwell as outdoor air temperatures.

The lower operating \ntonnage and COP ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to \noperate numbers. The degraded equipment performance is costing Summit Hotel Properties significant money \nand wasting energy. The pilot chiller is using significantly more energy to operate than when it was new just \nfour years earlier. \nThe performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the chiller in the baseline and post \ntesting periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® \nECM resulted in a restoration of 8 operating tons and an average improvement of 32.6% in Coefficient of \nPerformance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the chiller throughout the year.\nThe Carrier chiller treated has a nominal capacity of 143 tons at the given test conditions at 100% load and 308 \ngallons per minute (GPM) flow through the evaporator.  The chiller was tested at ~85% load or 122 tons \nmaximum capacity (5 of 6 compressors running), a GPM of 308, and outside air temperatures of 74 degrees.  \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 659, "chars": 2626, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_075_chunk_0003", "next_id": "pdf_075_chunk_0005", "content_hash": "sha256:7fe663b77d83d9c712ca39ee84ef987c311db5cc816305dfe9a89df2c46a148f"}

This increased capacity reduces the annual \nkWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller was when \noperating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then \nsubtracting the revised cost to run the chiller at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was \ninstalled. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours or \nload the chiller will now operate due to the restored capacity.
