A. 
INTRODUCTION 
 
From February 6 to March 14, 2017 at the Miami Gardens location, testing was 
implemented to verify energy efficiency reduction through the Powertron Global’s 
product PermaFrost NMR affecting the refrigerant circuits of one 20-Ton package 
DX unit and to demonstrate the performance of an untreated system of the same 
make, model and age.  
 
Unit #9 - Lennox LGA240H2BS3G Serial 5607H16058, Mfg Date 2007, R-22 
equipped (TESTED) 
Unit #16 - Lennox LGA240H2BS3G Serial 5607H16056, Mfg Date 2007, R-22 
equipped (CONTROL) 
 
The testing was designed to monitor the operation of Unit #9 (tested) before and 
after the installation of PermaFrost NMR and to verify the amount of capacity 
restoration and the resulting improvement in kW/ton. Unit #16 (control) was also 
monitored using the same methodology to measure its current kW/ton efficiency 
without PermaFrost NMR during the same time duration. 
 
The monitoring isolates the entry and departure points of the medium being 
cooled and the power being used. By recording the conditions at those entry and 
departure points the overall cooling results can be compared to the overall power 
consumed to quantify the power costs per unit of cooling kW/Ton (kilowatt-per-
ton), EER (Energy Efficiency Ratio) & COP (Co-Efficient of Performance).
