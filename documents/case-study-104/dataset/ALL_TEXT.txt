A. 
INTRODUCTION 
 
From February 6 to March 14, 2017 at the Miami Gardens location, testing was 
implemented to verify energy efficiency reduction through the Powertron Global’s 
product PermaFrost NMR affecting the refrigerant circuits of one 20-Ton package 
DX unit and to demonstrate the performance of an untreated system of the same 
make, model and age.  
 
Unit #9 - Lennox LGA240H2BS3G Serial 5607H16058, Mfg Date 2007, R-22 
equipped (TESTED) 
Unit #16 - Lennox LGA240H2BS3G Serial 5607H16056, Mfg Date 2007, R-22 
equipped (CONTROL) 
 
The testing was designed to monitor the operation of Unit #9 (tested) before and 
after the installation of PermaFrost NMR and to verify the amount of capacity 
restoration and the resulting improvement in kW/ton. Unit #16 (control) was also 
monitored using the same methodology to measure its current kW/ton efficiency 
without PermaFrost NMR during the same time duration. 
 
The monitoring isolates the entry and departure points of the medium being 
cooled and the power being used. By recording the conditions at those entry and 
departure points the overall cooling results can be compared to the overall power 
consumed to quantify the power costs per unit of cooling kW/Ton (kilowatt-per-
ton), EER (Energy Efficiency Ratio) & COP (Co-Efficient of Performance).

GENERAL FINDINGS 
 
1. Pre Inspection 
Before testing began our engineering team arrived on site to perform a pre-test 
performance exercise. 
 
DHU 9 was observed as having low capacity production and high kW/ton due to 
the following: 
 
1) Low CFM due to glazed evaporator blower fan motor, loose evaporator blower 
fan belt. 
2) ERV not operating 
 
Powertron Global notified client and this action concluded with a service work 
order was sent to Major US Retailer’s service contractor. Repairs were concluded and 
system was determined to be ready for the test. 
 
DHU 16 was observed as having low capacity production and high kW/ton due to 
the following: 
 
1) Low CFM due to the loose evaporator blower fan belt and damaged blower 
motor sheave 
2) 2) ERV not operating 
3) 3) Problematic sub-cooling and superheat 
 
Powertron Global notified client and this action concluded with a service work 
order was sent to Major US Retailer’s service contractor. 
 
2. Equipment Selection 
DHU 9 was selected as the test candidate because it was the most conservative 
choice for performance improvement and was the best representation of Major US Retailer’s 
HVAC/R portfolio of equipment. 
 
 
3. Method of Procedure for testing: 
 
The objective of measuring the overall cooling production of HVAC/R systems 
can be realized by measuring the total energy consumed by the specific unit 
being tested and the total BTU production of the system then calculating these 
parameters to obtain kW per ton, EER (energy efficient ratio) and COP 
(coefficient of performance). Using that information the total BTUH of cooling 
production can be realized. The objective of measuring overall power consumed 


═══ PAGE 004 ═══

 
 
4 
by an HVAC/R system can be realized by measuring voltage, amperage and 
power factor.  
 
For these specific HVAC systems many parameters were measured every two 
seconds for a period of eight (8) days for the development of a scientific baseline 
of performance and a post period of eight (8) days for the development of a 
scientific post analysis of performance. Data was extracted from the parameters 
measured every five (5) seconds during the normal operating hours of 8am to 
11pm.  
 
Total BTUH was developed along with total kW consumption by measuring all 
required data points (13 points see appendix for points measured) and entering 
them into industry best practice engineering formulae. All measurement hardware 
was certified under NIST or CE standards. Engineering formulae was developed 
by AHRI / ASHRAE (American Heating and Refrigeration Institute / American 
Society of Heating Refrigeration & Air Conditioning Engineers) 
 
During regular business hours the outdoor air temperature entering the air-cooled 
condenser coils of each unit will affect the design capacity. Therefore we have 
provided baseline and post analysis of the eight (8) day periods at several 
outdoor air temperature intervals so as to provide the comparison of improved 
capacity and subsequent kW per ton, EER and COP across a variation of 
outdoor air temperatures consisting of a twelve (12) degree span (74-85 degrees 
F) to demonstrate the improvements across the temperature span. 
 
D.   
CONCLUSION 
 
The results of the testing validate the performance improvement and are 
consistent with the UL (Underwriters Laboratories) results of PermaFrost NMR 
and the 300+ case studies available for review.
