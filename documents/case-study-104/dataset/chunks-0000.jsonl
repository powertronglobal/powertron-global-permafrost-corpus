Unit #16 (control) was also \nmonitored using the same methodology to measure its current kW/ton efficiency \nwithout PermaFrost NMR during the same time duration. \n \nThe monitoring isolates the entry and departure points of the medium being \ncooled and the power being used. By recording the conditions at those entry and \ndeparture points the overall cooling results can be compared to the overall power \nconsumed to quantify the power costs per unit of cooling kW/Ton (kilowatt-per-\nton), EER (Energy Efficiency Ratio) & COP (Co-Efficient of Performance). \n \nB. \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n \nThe average efficiency improvements per system are:  \n \nTESTED \n \nUNIT #9 \nkW/Ton \nCapacity-\nTons \nCOP \nEER \nEnthalpy \nBaseline  \n0.99 \n22.2 \n3.61 \n12.31 \n5.53 \nPost \n0.81 \n25.7 \n4.4 \n15 \n6.39 \nImprovement % \n18.2% \n15.8% \n21.9% \n21.9% \n15.6% \nCONTROL \nUNIT #16 \nkW/Ton \nCapacity-\nTons \nCOP \nEER \nEnthalpy \nFeb 6-13 \n1.43 \n14.1 \n2.47 \n8.41 \n3.39  \nMar 7-14 \n*1.55 \n13.1 \n2.28 \n7.77 \n3.14  \n* as expected per more samples in warmer weather", "tokens": 719, "chars": 2544, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_011_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:3c42f74fd7d22c88930c3bbb4e1023984bdfd3079d96e758c09e62776bac8fbd"}

Pre Inspection \nBefore testing began our engineering team arrived on site to perform a pre-test \nperformance exercise. \n \nDHU 9 was observed as having low capacity production and high kW/ton due to \nthe following: \n \n1) Low CFM due to glazed evaporator blower fan motor, loose evaporator blower \nfan belt. \n2) ERV not operating \n \nPowertron Global notified client and this action concluded with a service work \norder was sent to Major US Retailer’s service contractor. Repairs were concluded and \nsystem was determined to be ready for the test. \n \nDHU 16 was observed as having low capacity production and high kW/ton due to \nthe following: \n \n1) Low CFM due to the loose evaporator blower fan belt and damaged blower \nmotor sheave \n2) 2) ERV not operating \n3) 3) Problematic sub-cooling and superheat \n \nPowertron Global notified client and this action concluded with a service work \norder was sent to Major US Retailer’s service contractor. \n \n2. Equipment Selection \nDHU 9 was selected as the test candidate because it was the most conservative \nchoice for performance improvement and was the best representation of Major US Retailer’s \nHVAC/R portfolio of equipment. \n \n \n3. Method of Procedure for testing: \n \nThe objective of measuring the overall cooling production of HVAC/R systems \ncan be realized by measuring the total energy consumed by the specific unit \nbeing tested and the total BTU production of the system then calculating these \nparameters to obtain kW per ton, EER (energy efficient ratio) and COP \n(coefficient of performance). Using that information the total BTUH of cooling \nproduction can be realized.

Using that information the total BTUH of cooling \nproduction can be realized. The objective of measuring overall power consumed \n\n\n\n \n \n4 \nby an HVAC/R system can be realized by measuring voltage, amperage and \npower factor.  \n \nFor these specific HVAC systems many parameters were measured every two \nseconds for a period of eight (8) days for the development of a scientific baseline \nof performance and a post period of eight (8) days for the development of a \nscientific post analysis of performance. Data was extracted from the parameters \nmeasured every five (5) seconds during the normal operating hours of 8am to \n11pm.  \n \nTotal BTUH was developed along with total kW consumption by measuring all \nrequired data points (13 points see appendix for points measured) and entering \nthem into industry best practice engineering formulae. All measurement hardware \nwas certified under NIST or CE standards. Engineering formulae was developed \nby AHRI / ASHRAE (American Heating and Refrigeration Institute / American \nSociety of Heating Refrigeration & Air Conditioning Engineers) \n \nDuring regular business hours the outdoor air temperature entering the air-cooled \ncondenser coils of each unit will affect the design capacity. Therefore we have \nprovided baseline and post analysis of the eight (8) day periods at several \noutdoor air temperature intervals so as to provide the comparison of improved \ncapacity and subsequent kW per ton, EER and COP across a variation of \noutdoor air temperatures consisting of a twelve (12) degree span (74-85 degrees \nF) to demonstrate the improvements across the temperature span. \n \nD.   \nCONCLUSION \n \nThe results of the testing validate the performance improvement and are \nconsistent with the UL (Underwriters Laboratories) results of PermaFrost NMR \nand the 300+ case studies available for review. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n5 \nF. \nAPPENDIX \n \nI. \nUnit #9 (TESTED) Performance Analysis Summary \nII. \nUnit #16 (CONTROL) Performance Analysis Summary \nIII. \nPoints Measured  \n \n*(all csv files are available) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAPPENDIX I \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nHVAC Performance Comparison: kW/Ton\nMajor US Retailer DHU 9 Kit 4 TESTED\nkW/Ton Comparison \nOSA Temp.\nBase kW/Ton\nPost kW/Ton\n74 degF\n1.22 kW/Ton\n1.04 kw/Ton\n75 degF\n1.06 kW/Ton\n0.79 kw/Ton\n76 degF\n1.05 kW/Ton\n0.84 kw/Ton\n77 degF\n0.92 kW/Ton\n0.81 kw/Ton\n78 degF\n0.88 kW/Ton\n0.76 kw/Ton\n79 degF\n0.91 kW/Ton\n0.77 kw/Ton\n80 degF\n0.95 kW/Ton\n0.72 kw/Ton\n81 degF\n0.91 kW/Ton\n0.75 kw/Ton\n82 degF\n0.91 kW/Ton\n0.78 kw/Ton\n83 degF\n0.96 kW/Ton\n0.88 kw/Ton\n84 degF\n0.89 kW/Ton\n0.76 kw/Ton\n85 degF\n1.17 kW/Ton\n0.79 kw/Ton\nReport Parameters \nOSA Range.\nRA Filter\nPF Filter\nSampling Rate\nTotal Base Samples\nTotal Post Samples\n74 degF - 85 degF\n68.0 degF - 72.0 degF\n0.5 - 1.0\n5s\n47362 samples\n45537 samples", "tokens": 820, "chars": 2988, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 7}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_011_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_011_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:34b778585bfd9e9ff61d22fbbac1152817a06889f21a93f9f25016453268c3ea"}
