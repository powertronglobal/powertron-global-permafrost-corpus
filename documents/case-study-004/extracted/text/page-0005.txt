Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results 
DX Units Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Energy Solutions Company has the problem of thermal degradation in its HVAC/R units. The lower operating tonnage and COP 
ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. The 
degraded equipment performance is costing Aierko significant money and wasting energy. The equipment is 
using significantly more kWh to operate than it used when it was new. 
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the DX units in the baseline and 
post testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. 
The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 5.9 operating tons and an average 
improvement of 22.5% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the DX 
units throughout the year.
