Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for Energy Solutions Company’s DX Units (both Unit #3 & #4 combined).
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 37.4 tons
kW Baseline (Adjusted): .77 kW/ton * 43.3 tons = 33.3 kW
Annual kWh Baseline: 33.3 kW * 2860 Annual Operating Hrs = 95,238 kWh
Annual Cost Baseline: 95,238 kWh * $.26 = $24,762
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: .63 kW/ton * 43.3 tons = 27.3 kW
Annual kWh Post: 27.3 kW * 2860 hours = 78,078 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 78,078 kWh * .26 cents = $20,300
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $24,762 - $ 20,300 = $4,462
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $4,462 / 12 = $372
Initial Payback Period
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot DX units: $3,500
Estimated ROI Period for Pilot DX Units: $3,500/ $372 = 9.4 months
Annual Rate of Return = 127%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 637% or a savings of $22,310 over the next 5 years of service life
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for 
Energy Solutions Company for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post 
Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems was when operating at the original energy 
profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the 
systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the 
most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the systems will now operate due to the 
restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the internal building set points with increased 
efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
