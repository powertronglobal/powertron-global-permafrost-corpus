Recovered Wasted Energy with ECM - DX Units
The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration PermaFrost NMR® created in the treated 
DX units. The average cost to operate these units before 
it was treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, was .77.
The specific cost to operate these units after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, is currently .63.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ 
was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate for 
12-year-old DX units. The post results are also in line 
with the average improvement savings shown over 
more than 130,000 installations globally.
