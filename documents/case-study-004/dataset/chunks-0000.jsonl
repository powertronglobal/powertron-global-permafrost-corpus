Many industry leading \norganizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age. \nThermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVAC/R equipment that operates as a \nvapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well \ndocumented by the HVAC/R industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal \ndegradation prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times \nand additional kWh consumption.\nThe DX units in this study represent a great \nmajority of the portfolio of equipment \noperated by Energy Solutions Company. If thermal degradation \nis present in these DX units, it is present in \nthe entire inventory of equipment. Energy \nwaste can be calculated based on this unit \n(portfolio representation) and then \naccurately extrapolated across the entire \ninventory of equipment.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 558, "chars": 2643, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_019_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:c9fae61d6cb3a6dc41443649bec740a164549dcf060d455849310df16d419b5f"}

The cooling capacity the DX units are capable of producing after 12 years in service. \n \n2.  The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the DX units are delivering  \n     \n     as reflected in the kW/ton measurement before and after the ECM is administered. \n \n3.  The thermal dynamic ability of the DX units to perform at or close to operational design before and \n \n     after the ECM is administered.\nMethodology\nThe measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the \nIPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted of Powertron \nGlobal’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer] and for Energy Solutions Company, [Client Sales Manager] (Sales Manager), \n[Client Service Manager] (Service Manager), [Client Service Supervisor] (Service Supervisor) & Eng. \n[Client Technical Specialist] III Gonzalez, CBCP-IT, PCF.\nNotes\nThe units measured services the main Energy Solutions Company office building. Both the baseline and post measurements were taken with \noutside air temperatures of 89 degrees. \nThe following IPMVP data points were recorded on February 18, 2015 using recently calibrated devices by NIST \n(National Institutes of Standards and Technology) to insure measurement accuracy. The DX unit was then treated with \nPermaFrost NMR® on the same day and allowed to run until April 28, 2015 to ensure the patented surface science \nnanotechnology had ample time to seat into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All measurements were taken at \n100% load and at similar return air and outdoor air temperatures.\nThe collection of the data in both the baseline and post periods was collected by Powertron Global® under the watchful eye \nof Energy Solutions Company personnel. The Energy Solutions Company technicians, maintain the unit and oversaw this energy study. The boundary of the testing \nwas the DX units and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance calculations is very high.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 640, "chars": 3195, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_019_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_019_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:fffdca5d75d8a39a2e7a9af8f7b1b6a5a3bb81d265e41be62e877984a0bbc1ae"}

The report will also illustrate the amount of thermal \ndegradation that has occurred due in large part to thermal degradation within the heat exchangers and how much of \nthat has been restored.\n \nThe following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. \nThe results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:\n \n• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) \n \n• Tons = (Airflow * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta) / 12,000 \n \n• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage \n \n• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)\n \nNotes\nFollowing a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to determine the operational condition of the system was \nsatisfactory, Baseline M&V data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. Approximately Four hundred runtime \nhours after installation of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, the M&V team returned on a very similar weather day to the \nBaseline to take Post M&V measurements in the identical fashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements and \nassociated calculations show the amount of capacity restored.\nThe performance and capacity rating of commercial & industrial air conditioning & heat pump equipment is determined \nby adherence to the standard AHRI 340/360-2007. In that standard it states that the factory listed nameplate data \nidentifying capacity is based upon three 10 minute tests where the condenser is exposed to 95 degrees dry bulb and 75 \ndegrees wet bulb and the evaporator is exposed to 80 degrees dry bulb and 67 degrees wet bulb temperatures. These \ntemperatures are also based on the standard calculation of 400 CFM per ton for comfort cooling.\nAs was in this test at Energy Solutions Company, the units were not in a sustained static environment which caused the existing weather and \ninterior operating conditions to be utilized to demonstrate performance and capacity thus when these thresholds are not \nmet but are less than, the capacity of the equipment will increase in a non proportional manner. When measuring \ncaparison performance data under these conditions, what must be accomplished is that the baseline and post ranges of \nenvironments be duplicated and in this test these conditions were met. This is why the capacity of both units measured \nbefore and after the ECM show higher than the nominal rated tons. \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 690, "chars": 3220, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_019_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_019_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:a4088d1433eaf1796307943548be8d2f1edfc6370b4dcffe63e057275c5fd22b"}
