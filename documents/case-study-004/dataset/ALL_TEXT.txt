HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report
Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study
The purpose of this study is to verify the industry wide problem of efficiency loss in HVAC/R as projected by 
ASHRAE research and to quantify the amount of money wasted due to this loss. Many industry leading 
organizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age. 
Thermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVAC/R equipment that operates as a 
vapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well 
documented by the HVAC/R industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal 
degradation prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times 
and additional kWh consumption.
The DX units in this study represent a great 
majority of the portfolio of equipment 
operated by Energy Solutions Company. If thermal degradation 
is present in these DX units, it is present in 
the entire inventory of equipment. Energy 
waste can be calculated based on this unit 
(portfolio representation) and then 
accurately extrapolated across the entire 
inventory of equipment.

Process
This report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of two DX units that 
support the Energy Solutions Company Holding Company Headquarters, Caguas, Puerto Rico.
Detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the pilot DX units before and 
after the installation of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM to determine the impact on the three key elements that 
greatly affect Energy Solutions Company’s HVAC power bill as they relate to the original design specifications: 
 
1.  The cooling capacity the DX units are capable of producing after 12 years in service. 
 
2.  The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the DX units are delivering  
     
     as reflected in the kW/ton measurement before and after the ECM is administered. 
 
3.  The thermal dynamic ability of the DX units to perform at or close to operational design before and 
 
     after the ECM is administered.
Methodology
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the 
IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted of Powertron 
Global’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer] and for Energy Solutions Company, [Client Sales Manager] (Sales Manager), 
[Client Service Manager] (Service Manager), [Client Service Supervisor] (Service Supervisor) & Eng. 
[Client Technical Specialist] III Gonzalez, CBCP-IT, PCF.
Notes
The units measured services the main Energy Solutions Company office building. Both the baseline and post measurements were taken with 
outside air temperatures of 89 degrees. 
The following IPMVP data points were recorded on February 18, 2015 using recently calibrated devices by NIST 
(National Institutes of Standards and Technology) to insure measurement accuracy. The DX unit was then treated with 
PermaFrost NMR® on the same day and allowed to run until April 28, 2015 to ensure the patented surface science 
nanotechnology had ample time to seat into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All measurements were taken at 
100% load and at similar return air and outdoor air temperatures.
The collection of the data in both the baseline and post periods was collected by Powertron Global® under the watchful eye 
of Energy Solutions Company personnel. The Energy Solutions Company technicians, maintain the unit and oversaw this energy study. The boundary of the testing 
was the DX units and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance calculations is very high.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the pilot DX units to perform prior to 
and following the PermaFrost NMR® being installed. The report will also illustrate the amount of thermal 
degradation that has occurred due in large part to thermal degradation within the heat exchangers and how much of 
that has been restored.
 
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• Tons = (Airflow * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta) / 12,000 
 
• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
 
Notes
Following a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to determine the operational condition of the system was 
satisfactory, Baseline M&V data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. Approximately Four hundred runtime 
hours after installation of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, the M&V team returned on a very similar weather day to the 
Baseline to take Post M&V measurements in the identical fashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements and 
associated calculations show the amount of capacity restored.
The performance and capacity rating of commercial & industrial air conditioning & heat pump equipment is determined 
by adherence to the standard AHRI 340/360-2007. In that standard it states that the factory listed nameplate data 
identifying capacity is based upon three 10 minute tests where the condenser is exposed to 95 degrees dry bulb and 75 
degrees wet bulb and the evaporator is exposed to 80 degrees dry bulb and 67 degrees wet bulb temperatures. These 
temperatures are also based on the standard calculation of 400 CFM per ton for comfort cooling.
As was in this test at Energy Solutions Company, the units were not in a sustained static environment which caused the existing weather and 
interior operating conditions to be utilized to demonstrate performance and capacity thus when these thresholds are not 
met but are less than, the capacity of the equipment will increase in a non proportional manner. When measuring 
caparison performance data under these conditions, what must be accomplished is that the baseline and post ranges of 
environments be duplicated and in this test these conditions were met. This is why the capacity of both units measured 
before and after the ECM show higher than the nominal rated tons.

Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results 
DX Units Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Energy Solutions Company has the problem of thermal degradation in its HVAC/R units. The lower operating tonnage and COP 
ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. The 
degraded equipment performance is costing Aierko significant money and wasting energy. The equipment is 
using significantly more kWh to operate than it used when it was new. 
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the DX units in the baseline and 
post testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. 
The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 5.9 operating tons and an average 
improvement of 22.5% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the DX 
units throughout the year.

Recovered Wasted Energy with ECM - DX Units
The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration PermaFrost NMR® created in the treated 
DX units. The average cost to operate these units before 
it was treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, was .77.
The specific cost to operate these units after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, is currently .63.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ 
was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate for 
12-year-old DX units. The post results are also in line 
with the average improvement savings shown over 
more than 130,000 installations globally.

Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for Energy Solutions Company’s DX Units (both Unit #3 & #4 combined).
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 37.4 tons
kW Baseline (Adjusted): .77 kW/ton * 43.3 tons = 33.3 kW
Annual kWh Baseline: 33.3 kW * 2860 Annual Operating Hrs = 95,238 kWh
Annual Cost Baseline: 95,238 kWh * $.26 = $24,762
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: .63 kW/ton * 43.3 tons = 27.3 kW
Annual kWh Post: 27.3 kW * 2860 hours = 78,078 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 78,078 kWh * .26 cents = $20,300
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $24,762 - $ 20,300 = $4,462
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $4,462 / 12 = $372
Initial Payback Period
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot DX units: $3,500
Estimated ROI Period for Pilot DX Units: $3,500/ $372 = 9.4 months
Annual Rate of Return = 127%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 637% or a savings of $22,310 over the next 5 years of service life
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for 
Energy Solutions Company for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post 
Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems was when operating at the original energy 
profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the 
systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the 
most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the systems will now operate due to the 
restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the internal building set points with increased 
efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
