HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report

Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study

The purpose of this study is to verify the industry wide problem of efficiency loss in HVAC/R as projected by

ASHRAE research and to quantify the amount of money wasted due to this loss. Many industry leading

organizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they age.

Thermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVAC/R equipment that operates as a

vapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is well

documented by the HVAC/R industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal

degradation prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times

and additional kWh consumption.

The chiller in this study is representative of a great majority of the portfolio of equipment operated by

Major Global Bank. If thermal degradation is present in this chiller it is present in the entire inventory of equipment.

Energy waste can be calculated based on this equipment (portfolio representation) and then accurately

extrapolated across the entire inventory of equipment.

Process

This report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of one chiller that support

the Major Global Bank location at One Court Square.

Detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the chiller before and after the

installation of the ECM to determine the impact on the three key elements that greatly affect the HVAC power

bill as they relate to the original design specifications:

1. The cooling capacity the chiller produces after 27 years in service, before and after the administration

of the ECM.

2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the chiller can deliver as

reflected in the kW/ton measurement, before and after the administration of the ECM.

3. The thermal dynamic ability of the chiller to perform in relation to operational design, before and

after the administration of the ECM.

Methodology

The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the

IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted Fred Varone

Chief Engineer with Commercial Real Estate Services and Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, Edward

[Senior Energy Engineer].

Notes

The equipment tested 880 water-cooled chiller manufactured by HVAC Equipment Manufacturer. The baseline measurements were taken with

outside air temperature of 82 degrees F and the post measurements were taken with outside air temperature of 90 degrees F.

The flow rate through the evaporator was set close to design specifications and matched in the baseline and post. The

return chilled water entering the chiller in the baseline and post were nearly identical so no adjustments were made.

The boundary of the testing was the chiller and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance

calculations is very high.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)

The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the chiller to perform prior to the ECM

being installed, as well as illustrate the amount of thermal degradation

within the heat exchangers.

The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan.

The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:

• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase)

• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage

• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)

• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU

• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Water Temp – Saturated Evaporator Temp (CH)

Notes

Following a diagnostic examination to determine the operational condition of the chiller was satisfactory, Baseline M&V

data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. 350+ runtime hours after installation of the ECM, the M&V team

returned to take Post M&V measurements in the identical fashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements

and associated calculations show the amount of capacity restored.

The following IPMVP data points were recorded on 31 July 2015 using recently calibrated by NIST (National Institutes

of Standards and Technology) to insure GPM measurement accuracy. The chiller was then treated with PermaFrost

NMR® on the same day and allowed to run normally until 9 September 2015 to ensure the patented surface science

nanotechnology had ample time to seat into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. The collection of the data, in

both the baseline and post periods, was witnessed by Commercial Real Estate Services and Powertron Global.

Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results

Chiller Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM

Major Global Bank has the problem of thermal degradation in its chillers. The lower operating tonnage and COP

ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. The

degraded equipment performance is costing Major Global Bank significant money and wasting energy. The chiller is

using significantly more energy to operate than when it was new.

The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the chiller in the baseline and post

testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation.

The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 245 operating tons and an

improvement of 46.9% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the chiller

throughout the year.

Recovered Unit Cost with ECM – Chiller#1

The kW/ton is the standard Unit Cost in the HVAC

industry. It is the HVAC industry’s standard of

determining how much energy is required to create 1 ton

of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you reduce your

unit cost of cooling you are saving energy of how much

overall cooling you require.

The chart to the right illustrates the performance

restoration the ECM created in the treated chiller. The

average cost to operate this chiller before it was treated

with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in kW/ton, was

1.16 kW/Ton.

The specific cost to operate this chiller after it was

treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in

kW/ton, is currently .79 kW/Ton.

The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ was

expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate for a

27-year-old chiller utilizing R-123 refrigerant. The post results are also in line with the average

improvement savings shown over more than 130,000 installations globally.

Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics

The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR®

Post measurement period for the One Court Square Chiller.

Baseline Energy Consumption

Baseline Tonnage: 530.2 tons

Adjusted kW Baseline: 1.16 kW/ton * 774.9 tons = 898.9 kW

Adjusted Baseline kWh: 898.9 kW * 531 Annual Operating Hrs = 477,316 kWh

Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 477,316kWh * $.155 = $73,984

Post Energy Consumption

kW Post: .79 kW/ton * 774.9 tons = 612.2 kW

Annual kWh Post: 612.2 kW * 531 hours = 325,078 kWh

Annual Cost Post: 325,078 kWh * .155 cents = $50,387

Savings Per Year

Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $73,984 - $50,387 = $23,597

Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $23,597 / 12 = $1,966

Initial Payback Period

Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot chiller: $6,153

Estimated ROI Period for Major Global Bank on the chiller: $6,153 / $1,966= 3.1 months

Annual Rate of Return = 383.5%

Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 1917.5%

Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for

Major Global Bank for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true

energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in

the Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller was when operating at the original

energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to

run the chiller at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed. This regression analysis is

the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours or load the chiller will now operate due to

the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the chiller to reach the internal building set points with increased

efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.

Major Global Bank is Saving More than Just Energy

By treating the pilot chiller with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the current manner in which the Major Global Bank

operates the chiller, it will save approximately 152,238 kWh per year and all the costs associated with those

savings. From an environmental impact standpoint, Summit is also benefitting the surrounding community

of Long Island City. Imagine how great the environmental impact will be when Major Global Bank moves forward

with treating all their HVAC/R equipment in all their properties across their portfolio.

The 152,238 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 105 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from

being released or any of the following:

Annual greenhouse emissions from:

CO2 emissions from:
