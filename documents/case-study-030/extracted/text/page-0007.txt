Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the One Court Square Chiller.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 530.2 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: 1.16 kW/ton * 774.9 tons = 898.9 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 898.9 kW * 531 Annual Operating Hrs = 477,316 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 477,316kWh * $.155 = $73,984
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: .79 kW/ton * 774.9 tons = 612.2 kW
Annual kWh Post: 612.2 kW * 531 hours = 325,078 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 325,078 kWh * .155 cents = $50,387
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $73,984 - $50,387 = $23,597
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $23,597 / 12 = $1,966
Initial Payback Period
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot chiller: $6,153
Estimated ROI Period for Major Global Bank on the chiller: $6,153 / $1,966= 3.1 months
Annual Rate of Return = 383.5%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 1917.5%
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for 
Major Global Bank for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true 
energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in 
the Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller was when operating at the original 
energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to 
run the chiller at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed. This regression analysis is 
the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours or load the chiller will now operate due to 
the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the chiller to reach the internal building set points with increased 
efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
