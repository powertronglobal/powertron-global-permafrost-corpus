Methodology
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the 
IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted Fred Varone 
Chief Engineer with Commercial Real Estate Services and Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, Edward 
[Senior Energy Engineer].  
Notes
The equipment tested 880 water-cooled chiller manufactured by HVAC Equipment Manufacturer. The baseline measurements were taken with 
outside air temperature of 82 degrees F and the post measurements were taken with outside air temperature of 90 degrees F.  
The flow rate through the evaporator was set close to design specifications and matched in the baseline and post. The 
return chilled water entering the chiller in the baseline and post were nearly identical so no adjustments were made.
The boundary of the testing was the chiller and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance 
calculations is very high.
