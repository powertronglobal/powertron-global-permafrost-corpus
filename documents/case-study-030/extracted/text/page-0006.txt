Recovered Unit Cost with ECM – Chiller#1
The kW/ton is the standard Unit Cost in the HVAC 
industry. It is the HVAC industry’s standard of 
determining how much energy is required to create 1 ton 
of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you reduce your 
unit cost of cooling you are saving energy of how much 
overall cooling you require.
The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration the ECM created in the treated chiller. The 
average cost to operate this chiller before it was treated 
with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in kW/ton, was 
1.16 kW/Ton.
The specific cost to operate this chiller after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, is currently .79 kW/Ton.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ was 
expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate for a 
27-year-old chiller utilizing R-123 refrigerant. The post results are also in line with the average 
improvement savings shown over more than 130,000 installations globally.
