Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the chiller to perform prior to the ECM 
being installed, as well as illustrate the amount of thermal degradation 
within the heat exchangers.
 
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
 
• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU 
 
• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Water Temp – Saturated Evaporator Temp (CH) 
Notes
Following a diagnostic examination to determine the operational condition of the chiller was satisfactory, Baseline M&V 
data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. 350+ runtime hours after installation of the ECM, the M&V team 
returned to take Post M&V measurements in the identical fashion as in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements 
and associated calculations show the amount of capacity restored.
The following IPMVP data points were recorded on 31 July 2015 using recently calibrated by NIST (National Institutes 
of Standards and Technology) to insure GPM measurement accuracy. The chiller was then treated with PermaFrost 
NMR® on the same day and allowed to run normally until 9 September 2015 to ensure the patented surface science 
nanotechnology had ample time to seat into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. The collection of the data, in 
both the baseline and post periods, was witnessed by Commercial Real Estate Services and Powertron Global.
