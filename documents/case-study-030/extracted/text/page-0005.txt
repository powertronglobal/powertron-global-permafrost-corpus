Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results 
Chiller Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Major Global Bank has the problem of thermal degradation in its chillers. The lower operating tonnage and COP 
ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. The 
degraded equipment performance is costing Major Global Bank significant money and wasting energy. The chiller is 
using significantly more energy to operate than when it was new. 
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the chiller in the baseline and post 
testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. 
The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 245 operating tons and an 
improvement of 46.9% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the chiller 
throughout the year.
