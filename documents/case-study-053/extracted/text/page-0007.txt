Testing Methodology
The M&V team used the aforementioned IPMVP methodology to capture the performance and energy use of 
the three pilot systems. First, after verifying the amount of air flowing across the evaporator coils in the DX 
equipment before beginning each pilot phase, the subsequent measurements used in the efficiency calculations 
were collected and compiled in accordance with Option B of the IPMVP. This Protocol was developed by 
experts in the international community to provide a consistent method for analyzing HVAC system 
performance. Baseline measurements for the RTUs were taken on 4 and 5 February, 2016. Post measurements 
for these same three RTUs were taken on 3 and 4 March, 2016. 
 
The results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic 
engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor * Sq Rt 3 /1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• kW/ton = Actual Measured Energy / Actual Measured Capacity 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = 12 / (kW/ton) /3.412
 
• Tons of Cooling = (Measured CFM * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta T) / 12,000 BTU
 
• Enthalpy = (WB Enter Temp converted to Enthalpy – WB Leaving Temp converted to Enthalpy)
