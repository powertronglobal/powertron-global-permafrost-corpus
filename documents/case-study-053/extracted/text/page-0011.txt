Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics for 30-Ton Pilot RTU
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements and financial projections before and 
after the ECM was installed in the 30-ton pilot RTU. These results may vary slightly from the tables listed earlier 
in this report due to rounding only to the first decimal position for cooling tons and kW values.
Average Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Capacity:  19.89 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline:  0.98 kW/ton * 24.27 tons = 23.78 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh:  23.78 kW * 6,132 Annual Operating Hours = 145,819 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 145,819 kWh * $.105 = $15,311
Average Post Energy Consumption
kW Post:  0.78 kW/ton * 24.27 tons = 18.93 kW
Annual kWh Post:  18.93 kW * 6,132 hours = 116,079 kWh
Annual Cost Post:  116,079 kWh * $.105 cents = $12,188
Average Savings per Year Per Unit
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year:  $15,311 - $12,188 = $3,123
Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $3,123 / 12 = $260
Return on Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the operational portion of the 30-ton pilot RTU: $2,500*
Estimated ROI for Regional Telecom when treating the 30-ton pilot RTU: $2,500 / $260 = ~9.6 mos
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 125%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 625%

(*) The cost to treat the entire unit was $3,750, but since only 2 of the 3 compressors on the unit were operational 
during the entire pilot and produced the savings, the cost to treat only that portion of the system was used in the 
calculations. If the full cost of treatment was used the ROI expands to just over 14 months.
