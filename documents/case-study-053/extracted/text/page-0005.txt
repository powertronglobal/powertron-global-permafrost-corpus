Key Performance Results 
When comparing the three pilot RTUs before and after PermaFrost NMR® was installed, below are some of the 
highlights of the study:
 
• With PermaFrost NMR® all the benefits produced are directly linked to increasing capacity. When 
 
    initially tested, the pilot RTUs together were producing 40.54 tons of cooling. Following installation, 
 
    the cooling capacity jumped by 9.82 tons or 24.2% to 50.36 tons. 
 
• The overall cost to produce each ton of cooling on the three RTUs dropped 22.8% from an average of 
 
    1.14 kW/ton in the baseline to .88 kW/ton in the post. This means for every ton of cooling the pilot 
 
    RTUs are asked to produce, Regional Telecom is spending 22.8% less to do so.
 
• The projected annual kWh’s were reduced by 75,668 or 22.2%, from 340,510 to 264,842.
 
• The average cost to operate the three pilot RTUs dropped 22.2% from a total of $35,754 in the baseline 
 
    to $27,809 in the post. This reflects annual energy savings of $7,945.  
 
• The average Coefficient of Performance (COP) of the three pilot RTUs increased from 3.12 in the 
 
    baseline to 4.02 representing an improvement of 28.8%
 
• When operating under nearly identical weather and building load conditions, the average discharge 
 
    pressure across the three pilot RTUs decreased from 215.2 in the baseline to 197.8 in the post. This 
 
    represents a reduction of 8.1%. This improvement in the ability of the RTUs to dissipate heat faster 
 
    will work to extend compressor life when outside temperatures are elevated in the warmer months 
 
    of the year.
The three RTUs involved in the pilot are recorded as follows:
Lennox RTU, Mfg date: 2004, R22, Nominal 30-tons full load, 210V/3Ph, Model LCA360
Lennox RTU, Mfg date: 2000, R22, Nominal 25-tons full load, 210V/3Ph, Model LGA300
Lennox RTU, Mfg date: 1998, R22, Nominal 20-tons full load, 210V/3Ph, Model LGA240
