The improvements demonstrated in this or any field test resulting from PermaFrost NMR® are dependent on 
factors such as age, condition, service history, runtime of one or more compressors, and the design and 
operational application of each HVAC system. The results in this pilot were very consistent with 14+ year 
historical performance averages as well as the recent independent laboratory study completed in May, 2015 on 
DX equipment by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) in their testing chambers in [Texas Location], TX.
The data for each of the three pilot RTUs will be shown in separate sections.
