Objectives
The four key objectives for this PermaFrost NMR® pilot study were all achieved. They included: 
 
1. Determine that the “as-is” capacity and efficiency of the pilot RTUs supporting the Regional Telecom switching 
 
    centers had degraded by at least 10% on average after 10+ years in operation.  
 
2. Demonstrate at least 7% performance improvement in tonnage and/or corresponding kW/ton and 
 
    energy reduction in the pilot systems 350-400 hours or more after PermaFrost NMR® was installed. 
 
3. Demonstrate the ability of the pilot RTUs to produce cooler, drier air as measured in both Dry Bulb 
 
    and/or Wet Bulb deltas for the DX equipment after being treated. 
 
4. To support an effective business case for further deployments of the ECM within the Regional Telecom 
   
    portfolio of properties, demonstrate the financial benefits associated with efficiency improvements 
 
    realized over the duration of the study. These benefits must be equivalent to an 18-month or less 
 
    payback to Regional Telecom on their initial project costs.  
ECM Product Brief
PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented surface science 
nanotechnology that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR®) 
technology as its core agent. A sustainable, one-time treatment with 
no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining 
life of any type of climate control system in which it is installed. 
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are increased capacity 
resulting in improved system efficiency.
