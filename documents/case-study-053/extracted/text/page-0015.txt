IPMVP Baseline & Post Measurements in Treated 25-Ton Pilot RTU
The chart below lists all of the performance measurements taken on the treated 25-ton pilot RTU. Only recently 
calibrated quality instruments were used to capture the data. Care was also taken to collect both the baseline 
and post measurements at nearly identical weather conditions so as not to unduly affect the resulting data.
