Explanation of Regression Analysis
To obtain a realistic avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Regional Telecom for implementing the PermaFrost 
NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy savings resulting from the improvement 
in both capacity and efficiency utilizing data collected during the pilot study. These improvements reduce the annual kWh 
expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the RTU was when operating 
at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available capacity before then subtracting the revised 
cost to run the RTU at the same restored capacity after the ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely 
accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or load % at which the RTU will now operate due to 
the restored performance profile. If the building control system and associated thermostats are operating normally, this 
restored performance profile will normally allow the RTU to satisfy the internal area set points with increased efficiency 
resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
