Improved Unit Cost Following ECM
The “Unit Cost” in the HVAC industry is the kW/ton 
ratio. KW/ton is commonly used for larger commercial 
and industrial air conditioning, heat pump and 
refrigeration systems. It is the HVAC industry’s standard 
of determining how much energy is required to create a 
single ton of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you 
reduce the unit cost of cooling you are saving energy 
regardless of how much overall cooling is required.
The chart to the right clearly illustrates the amount of 
efficiency restoration the ECM created in the pilot 30-Ton 
RTU after treatment. The treated RTU is now performing 
20.4% more efficiently than before being treated. This 
degradation in operational efficiency was costing 
Regional Telecom a substantial amount of money in wasted 
energy.
