This study focused \non three large Roof Top HVAC Package Units (RTUs) supporting the switch rooms at both of these mixed use \nsites. The equipment tested included a 30-ton RTU, 25-ton RTU and a 20-ton RTU.  \nAll the measurements for this pilot followed the International Measurement and Verification Protocols \n(IPMVP). The IPMVP is endorsed by the US Department of Energy as the best method for measuring capacity, \nperformance and efficiency of HVAC systems in-situ.  \nThe same certified test equipment was used under identical weather conditions in both the baseline and post \ncollection periods and photographic evidence is available of all key measurements. This ensured that all the \nbenefits produced could definitively be attributed to the PermaFrost NMR® energy conservation measure (ECM).\nOverview\nRunning from 4 February to 4 March, 2016, the Regional Telecom Communications pilot was designed to illustrate the \npositive impact PermaFrost NMR® would have on the capacity, performance, and overall efficiency measured \nin kW/ton of the three pilot RTUs.\nAs demonstrated in this field trial, PermaFrost NMR restores the capacity on the RTUs that has been lost over \ntime due to fouling of the heat exchange surfaces. The ECM will immediately benefit Regional Telecom in any or all of \nthe following ways:\n \n• Restoring capacity of the systems to satisfy fluctuating building loads or lower room temps\n \n• Producing additional system redundancy at no extra cost or interruption to operations \n \n• Improving system efficiency, lowering cost to produce each ton of cooling required (kW/ton)\n \n• Restoring thermal efficiency, allowing systems to achieve thermostat set points faster, reducing \n \n    runtime and extending equipment life by 15% or more \n \n• Reducing annual kWh usage by the HVAC systems\n \n \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 702, "chars": 3272, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_054_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:ecdbd19ad8c1260382e030367136443616afefc434917090cce5d477e46b218b"}

When \n \n    initially tested, the pilot RTUs together were producing 40.54 tons of cooling. Following installation, \n \n    the cooling capacity jumped by 9.82 tons or 24.2% to 50.36 tons. \n \n• The overall cost to produce each ton of cooling on the three RTUs dropped 22.8% from an average of \n \n    1.14 kW/ton in the baseline to .88 kW/ton in the post. This means for every ton of cooling the pilot \n \n    RTUs are asked to produce, Regional Telecom is spending 22.8% less to do so.\n \n• The projected annual kWh’s were reduced by 75,668 or 22.2%, from 340,510 to 264,842.\n \n• The average cost to operate the three pilot RTUs dropped 22.2% from a total of $35,754 in the baseline \n \n    to $27,809 in the post. This reflects annual energy savings of $7,945.  \n \n• The average Coefficient of Performance (COP) of the three pilot RTUs increased from 3.12 in the \n \n    baseline to 4.02 representing an improvement of 28.8%\n \n• When operating under nearly identical weather and building load conditions, the average discharge \n \n    pressure across the three pilot RTUs decreased from 215.2 in the baseline to 197.8 in the post. This \n \n    represents a reduction of 8.1%. This improvement in the ability of the RTUs to dissipate heat faster \n \n    will work to extend compressor life when outside temperatures are elevated in the warmer months \n \n    of the year.\nThe three RTUs involved in the pilot are recorded as follows:\nLennox RTU, Mfg date: 2004, R22, Nominal 30-tons full load, 210V/3Ph, Model LCA360\nLennox RTU, Mfg date: 2000, R22, Nominal 25-tons full load, 210V/3Ph, Model LGA300\nLennox RTU, Mfg date: 1998, R22, Nominal 20-tons full load, 210V/3Ph, Model LGA240 \n  \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 666, "chars": 2584, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_054_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_054_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:452fe61b2e9f833c38202fddc0a6215d4d97f2bfc05e45bfd6a0c51ca7a51fc1"}

They included: \n \n1. Determine that the “as-is” capacity and efficiency of the pilot RTUs supporting the Regional Telecom switching \n \n    centers had degraded by at least 10% on average after 10+ years in operation.  \n \n2. Demonstrate at least 7% performance improvement in tonnage and/or corresponding kW/ton and \n \n    energy reduction in the pilot systems 350-400 hours or more after PermaFrost NMR® was installed. \n \n3. Demonstrate the ability of the pilot RTUs to produce cooler, drier air as measured in both Dry Bulb \n \n    and/or Wet Bulb deltas for the DX equipment after being treated. \n \n4. To support an effective business case for further deployments of the ECM within the Regional Telecom \n   \n    portfolio of properties, demonstrate the financial benefits associated with efficiency improvements \n \n    realized over the duration of the study. These benefits must be equivalent to an 18-month or less \n \n    payback to Regional Telecom on their initial project costs.  \nECM Product Brief\nPermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented surface science \nnanotechnology that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR®) \ntechnology as its core agent. A sustainable, one-time treatment with \nno down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining \nlife of any type of climate control system in which it is installed. \nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are increased capacity \nresulting in improved system efficiency.  \n  \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 463, "chars": 2121, "pages": {"start": 5, "end": 6}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_054_chunk_0003", "next_id": "pdf_054_chunk_0005", "content_hash": "sha256:b553ba86baac1459e13eaa5661a4d3094dee0209e052792ca1bcab25dc941572"}

First, after verifying the amount of air flowing across the evaporator coils in the DX \nequipment before beginning each pilot phase, the subsequent measurements used in the efficiency calculations \nwere collected and compiled in accordance with Option B of the IPMVP. This Protocol was developed by \nexperts in the international community to provide a consistent method for analyzing HVAC system \nperformance. Baseline measurements for the RTUs were taken on 4 and 5 February, 2016. Post measurements \nfor these same three RTUs were taken on 3 and 4 March, 2016. \n \nThe results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic \nengineering formulas:\n \n• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor * Sq Rt 3 /1000 (for 3-Phase) \n \n• kW/ton = Actual Measured Energy / Actual Measured Capacity \n \n• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = 12 / (kW/ton) /3.412\n \n• Tons of Cooling = (Measured CFM * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta T) / 12,000 BTU\n \n• Enthalpy = (WB Enter Temp converted to Enthalpy – WB Leaving Temp converted to Enthalpy)\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\n®\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n7\nImproved Unit Cost Following ECM\nThe “Unit Cost” in the HVAC industry is the kW/ton \nratio.

These improvements reduce the annual kWh \nexpended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the RTU was when operating \nat the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available capacity before then subtracting the revised \ncost to run the RTU at the same restored capacity after the ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely \naccepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or load % at which the RTU will now operate due to \nthe restored performance profile. If the building control system and associated thermostats are operating normally, this \nrestored performance profile will normally allow the RTU to satisfy the internal area set points with increased efficiency \nresulting in reduced compressor demand loading.\n11\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\n®\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\n12\nImproved Unit Cost Following ECM\nThe “Unit Cost” in the HVAC industry is the kW/ton \nratio.
