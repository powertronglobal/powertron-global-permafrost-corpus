Background
This report details the results of the recently completed comprehensive energy performance pilot study 
conducted at two Regional Telecom Communications locations in Bull Head City and Kingman, AZ. This study focused 
on three large Roof Top HVAC Package Units (RTUs) supporting the switch rooms at both of these mixed use 
sites. The equipment tested included a 30-ton RTU, 25-ton RTU and a 20-ton RTU.  
All the measurements for this pilot followed the International Measurement and Verification Protocols 
(IPMVP). The IPMVP is endorsed by the US Department of Energy as the best method for measuring capacity, 
performance and efficiency of HVAC systems in-situ.  
The same certified test equipment was used under identical weather conditions in both the baseline and post 
collection periods and photographic evidence is available of all key measurements. This ensured that all the 
benefits produced could definitively be attributed to the PermaFrost NMR® energy conservation measure (ECM).
Overview
Running from 4 February to 4 March, 2016, the Regional Telecom Communications pilot was designed to illustrate the 
positive impact PermaFrost NMR® would have on the capacity, performance, and overall efficiency measured 
in kW/ton of the three pilot RTUs.
As demonstrated in this field trial, PermaFrost NMR restores the capacity on the RTUs that has been lost over 
time due to fouling of the heat exchange surfaces. The ECM will immediately benefit Regional Telecom in any or all of 
the following ways:
 
• Restoring capacity of the systems to satisfy fluctuating building loads or lower room temps
 
• Producing additional system redundancy at no extra cost or interruption to operations 
 
• Improving system efficiency, lowering cost to produce each ton of cooling required (kW/ton)
 
• Restoring thermal efficiency, allowing systems to achieve thermostat set points faster, reducing 
 
    runtime and extending equipment life by 15% or more 
 
• Reducing annual kWh usage by the HVAC systems

The improvements demonstrated in this or any field test resulting from PermaFrost NMR® are dependent on 
factors such as age, condition, service history, runtime of one or more compressors, and the design and 
operational application of each HVAC system. The results in this pilot were very consistent with 14+ year 
historical performance averages as well as the recent independent laboratory study completed in May, 2015 on 
DX equipment by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) in their testing chambers in [Texas Location], TX.
The data for each of the three pilot RTUs will be shown in separate sections.
Financial Beneﬁts of the Study
Regional Telecom will realize the following financial benefits from investing a total of $5,313 on the installation of 
PermaFrost NMR® in the operational portions of the three RTUs included in this study: 
 
- Net Annual Energy Savings

Positive Impact on the Environment
Just by treating the three pilot RTUs with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the manner in which the RTUs are 
currently being operated, Regional Telecom will save approximately 75,668 kWh per year and all the costs associated 
with those savings. From an environmental impact standpoint, Regional Telecom will also benefit the surrounding 
Arizona communities in which they operate. Imagine the positive environmental impacts of treating the rest 
of the Regional Telecom portfolio of buildings in the southwest and across the US. 
 
The 75,668 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 53.6 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from 
being released or any of the following:

Key Performance Results 
When comparing the three pilot RTUs before and after PermaFrost NMR® was installed, below are some of the 
highlights of the study:
 
• With PermaFrost NMR® all the benefits produced are directly linked to increasing capacity. When 
 
    initially tested, the pilot RTUs together were producing 40.54 tons of cooling. Following installation, 
 
    the cooling capacity jumped by 9.82 tons or 24.2% to 50.36 tons. 
 
• The overall cost to produce each ton of cooling on the three RTUs dropped 22.8% from an average of 
 
    1.14 kW/ton in the baseline to .88 kW/ton in the post. This means for every ton of cooling the pilot 
 
    RTUs are asked to produce, Regional Telecom is spending 22.8% less to do so.
 
• The projected annual kWh’s were reduced by 75,668 or 22.2%, from 340,510 to 264,842.
 
• The average cost to operate the three pilot RTUs dropped 22.2% from a total of $35,754 in the baseline 
 
    to $27,809 in the post. This reflects annual energy savings of $7,945.  
 
• The average Coefficient of Performance (COP) of the three pilot RTUs increased from 3.12 in the 
 
    baseline to 4.02 representing an improvement of 28.8%
 
• When operating under nearly identical weather and building load conditions, the average discharge 
 
    pressure across the three pilot RTUs decreased from 215.2 in the baseline to 197.8 in the post. This 
 
    represents a reduction of 8.1%. This improvement in the ability of the RTUs to dissipate heat faster 
 
    will work to extend compressor life when outside temperatures are elevated in the warmer months 
 
    of the year.
The three RTUs involved in the pilot are recorded as follows:
Lennox RTU, Mfg date: 2004, R22, Nominal 30-tons full load, 210V/3Ph, Model LCA360
Lennox RTU, Mfg date: 2000, R22, Nominal 25-tons full load, 210V/3Ph, Model LGA300
Lennox RTU, Mfg date: 1998, R22, Nominal 20-tons full load, 210V/3Ph, Model LGA240

Objectives
The four key objectives for this PermaFrost NMR® pilot study were all achieved. They included: 
 
1. Determine that the “as-is” capacity and efficiency of the pilot RTUs supporting the Regional Telecom switching 
 
    centers had degraded by at least 10% on average after 10+ years in operation.  
 
2. Demonstrate at least 7% performance improvement in tonnage and/or corresponding kW/ton and 
 
    energy reduction in the pilot systems 350-400 hours or more after PermaFrost NMR® was installed. 
 
3. Demonstrate the ability of the pilot RTUs to produce cooler, drier air as measured in both Dry Bulb 
 
    and/or Wet Bulb deltas for the DX equipment after being treated. 
 
4. To support an effective business case for further deployments of the ECM within the Regional Telecom 
   
    portfolio of properties, demonstrate the financial benefits associated with efficiency improvements 
 
    realized over the duration of the study. These benefits must be equivalent to an 18-month or less 
 
    payback to Regional Telecom on their initial project costs.  
ECM Product Brief
PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented surface science 
nanotechnology that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR®) 
technology as its core agent. A sustainable, one-time treatment with 
no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining 
life of any type of climate control system in which it is installed. 
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are increased capacity 
resulting in improved system efficiency.

Testing Methodology
The M&V team used the aforementioned IPMVP methodology to capture the performance and energy use of 
the three pilot systems. First, after verifying the amount of air flowing across the evaporator coils in the DX 
equipment before beginning each pilot phase, the subsequent measurements used in the efficiency calculations 
were collected and compiled in accordance with Option B of the IPMVP. This Protocol was developed by 
experts in the international community to provide a consistent method for analyzing HVAC system 
performance. Baseline measurements for the RTUs were taken on 4 and 5 February, 2016. Post measurements 
for these same three RTUs were taken on 3 and 4 March, 2016. 
 
The results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic 
engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor * Sq Rt 3 /1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• kW/ton = Actual Measured Energy / Actual Measured Capacity 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = 12 / (kW/ton) /3.412
 
• Tons of Cooling = (Measured CFM * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta T) / 12,000 BTU
 
• Enthalpy = (WB Enter Temp converted to Enthalpy – WB Leaving Temp converted to Enthalpy)

Improved Unit Cost Following ECM
The “Unit Cost” in the HVAC industry is the kW/ton 
ratio. KW/ton is commonly used for larger commercial 
and industrial air conditioning, heat pump and 
refrigeration systems. It is the HVAC industry’s standard 
of determining how much energy is required to create a 
single ton of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you 
reduce the unit cost of cooling you are saving energy 
regardless of how much overall cooling is required.
The chart to the right clearly illustrates the amount of 
efficiency restoration the ECM created in the pilot 30-Ton 
RTU after treatment. The treated RTU is now performing 
20.4% more efficiently than before being treated. This 
degradation in operational efficiency was costing 
Regional Telecom a substantial amount of money in wasted 
energy.

Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics for 30-Ton Pilot RTU
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements and financial projections before and 
after the ECM was installed in the 30-ton pilot RTU. These results may vary slightly from the tables listed earlier 
in this report due to rounding only to the first decimal position for cooling tons and kW values.
Average Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Capacity:  19.89 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline:  0.98 kW/ton * 24.27 tons = 23.78 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh:  23.78 kW * 6,132 Annual Operating Hours = 145,819 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 145,819 kWh * $.105 = $15,311
Average Post Energy Consumption
kW Post:  0.78 kW/ton * 24.27 tons = 18.93 kW
Annual kWh Post:  18.93 kW * 6,132 hours = 116,079 kWh
Annual Cost Post:  116,079 kWh * $.105 cents = $12,188
Average Savings per Year Per Unit
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year:  $15,311 - $12,188 = $3,123
Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $3,123 / 12 = $260
Return on Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the operational portion of the 30-ton pilot RTU: $2,500*
Estimated ROI for Regional Telecom when treating the 30-ton pilot RTU: $2,500 / $260 = ~9.6 mos
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 125%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 625%
10
(*) The cost to treat the entire unit was $3,750, but since only 2 of the 3 compressors on the unit were operational 
during the entire pilot and produced the savings, the cost to treat only that portion of the system was used in the 
calculations. If the full cost of treatment was used the ROI expands to just over 14 months.

Explanation of Regression Analysis
To obtain a realistic avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Regional Telecom for implementing the PermaFrost 
NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy savings resulting from the improvement 
in both capacity and efficiency utilizing data collected during the pilot study. These improvements reduce the annual kWh 
expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the RTU was when operating 
at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available capacity before then subtracting the revised 
cost to run the RTU at the same restored capacity after the ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely 
accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or load % at which the RTU will now operate due to 
the restored performance profile. If the building control system and associated thermostats are operating normally, this 
restored performance profile will normally allow the RTU to satisfy the internal area set points with increased efficiency 
resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.

expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the RTU was when operating 
at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available capacity before then subtracting the revised 
cost to run the RTU at the same restored capacity after the ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely 
accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or load % at which the RTU will now operate due to 
the restored performance profile. If the building control system and associated thermostats are operating normally, this 
restored performance profile will normally allow the RTU to satisfy the internal area set points with increased efficiency 
resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.

Improved Unit Cost Following ECM
The “Unit Cost” in the HVAC industry is the kW/ton 
ratio. KW/ton is commonly used for larger commercial 
and industrial air conditioning, heat pump and 
refrigeration systems. It is the HVAC industry’s standard 
of determining how much energy is required to create a 
single ton of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you 
reduce the unit cost of cooling you are saving energy 
regardless of how much overall cooling is required.
The chart to the right clearly illustrates the amount of 
efficiency restoration the ECM created in the 20-ton pilot 
RTU after treatment. The treated RTU is now performing 
20.6% more efficiently than before being treated. This 
degradation in operational efficiency was costing 
Regional Telecom a substantial amount of money in wasted 
energy.

Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics for 20-Ton Pilot RTU
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements and financial projections before and 
after the ECM was installed in the 20-ton pilot RTU. These results may vary slightly from the tables listed earlier 
in this report due to rounding only to the first decimal position for cooling tons and kW values.
Average Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Capacity:  9.68 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline:  1.26 kW/ton * 12.05 tons = 15.18 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh:  15.18 kW * 6,132 Annual Operating Hours = 93,084 kWh   
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 93,084 kWh * $.105 = $9,774
Average Post Energy Consumption
kW Post:  1.00 kW/ton * 12.05 tons = 12.05 kW
Annual kWh Post:  12.05 kW * 6,132 hours = 73,891 kWh
Annual Cost Post:  73,891 kWh * $.105 cents = $7,759
Average Savings per Year Per Unit
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year:  $9,774 - $7,759 = $2,015
Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $2,015 / 12 = $168
Return on Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the 20-ton pilot RTU: $1,250
Estimated ROI for Regional Telecom when treating the 20-ton pilot RTU: $1,250 / $168 = ~7.4 mos
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 161%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 806%
20
(*) The cost to treat the entire unit was $2,500, but since only 2 of the 4 compressors on the unit were operational 
during the entire pilot and produced the savings, the cost to treat only that portion of the system ($1,250) was 
used in the calculations. If the full cost of treatment was used the ROI expands to just over 14 months.

Explanation of Regression Analysis
To obtain a realistic avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Regional Telecom for implementing the PermaFrost 
NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy savings resulting from the improvement 
in both capacity and efficiency utilizing data collected during the pilot study. These improvements reduce the annual kWh 
expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the RTU was when operating 
at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available capacity before then subtracting the revised 
cost to run the RTU at the same restored capacity after the ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely 
accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or load % at which the RTU will now operate due to 
the restored performance profile. If the building control system and associated thermostats are operating normally, this 
restored performance profile will normally allow the RTU to satisfy the internal area set points with increased efficiency 
resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
