Detailed \nforensic performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the two nominal 6-ton CRAC \nunits using R410A refrigerant. Following testing, the CRAC units were treated with the proper amount and \ntype of the PermaFrost NMR® technology specially formulated for these types of systems.  Measurement \nand Verification (M&V) was conducted pre-installation and post-gestation.\nThe improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly \nat the units was solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. \nThis is a result of the reversal of thermal inefficiency on heat exchange surfaces.  \nFollowing treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, the \nCRAC units showed an effective net average 29.5% reduction in \nkW/ton based on the exact capacity measured in the baseline M&V \nand the post gestation M&V. With each of the nominal 6-ton CRAC \nunits operating at 100%, the units showed an average 23% reduction \nin kWh while simultaneously producing an average increase in \nsystem efficiency of 29.1%. Prior to the ECM, the units each produced \nan average of 4.76 tons of cooling as measured in-situ. After the ECM, \nthe average tonnage produced increased to 6.07 tons or 104% of \noriginal design specification. This 27.5% average capacity increase \nand 33% improvement in refrigerant approach from the baseline \nperformance levels led to an effective average increase in COP of \n31%. All of these factors directly correlate to what Major Defense Contractor will \nrealize in energy savings as they operate these CRAC units in the \nfuture as well as other HVAC equipment like Roof Top Units and \nChillers under the similar parameters.\nEnergy Science Division\nUnit #8 on left was not put into service until \nNov 2011 while Unit #9 on right has been in \noperation since 2007. The difference in age \nand total runtime clearly presented itself \nduring the testing since both are key variables \ndirectly related to the amount thermal inefficiency in a \nsystem and the corresponding loss of \nperformance over time. \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 717, "chars": 3268, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_093_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:603eea15402ada95eb3b540d7570a705ff435fc2957fd01a355eaa98380dfc23"}

This is \nillustrated by the 26.9% increase in the enthalpy delta, which is a critical HVAC measurement used to \ndetermine the thermodynamic enhancement brought about by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result \nof the ECM improvement is an ROI to Major Defense Contractor that is measured in months. The tables of data used to \ndetermine the financial payback are available for review at the end of this report. \n  \nProduct Brief\n         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure \n(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative® (NMR™) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for at least 10 years in any \ntype of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and \nequipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); \nchilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia \nrefrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The \nequipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal \n(single and multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® in any type of HVACR system are improved cooling \nperformance, increased capacity and improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to \nachieve set point temperatures in a more rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. \nThe indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment \ninclude reduced run time, less kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life \ncycle time and a reduced carbon footprint for Major Defense Contractor.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 570, "chars": 2723, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_093_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_093_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:d19dcb393a80dcad4f26e91aa14ae9be63b72bb241d7b95bc53d1dfa7e7d150e"}

The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating, \nRefrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization \n(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation \nmethods and products.\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is \ndefined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single \nsource of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM \naffected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations \nusing measurements of proxies of energy use. \nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+/ - Routine Adjustments +/ - Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 446, "chars": 2214, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_093_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_093_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:4501322a6697e88f6a34fbfd1ad6851a171c4cd255a83bc3e5c36988d7e5dc96"}

Baseline M&V were recorded on both units and then the \nproper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected. The gestation period for the Major Defense Contractor pilot \nwas 4 weeks on these particular units to allow them to achieve the required ~250 hours of runtime on each \nto ensure adequate performance improvement time. At the end of this gestation period, Post M&V results \nwere taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same or very similar \nentering air dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures, entering condenser water temperatures (CDW), and of \ncourse outdoor air temperatures (OAT). These are three of the most critical variables to contend with in an \nin-situ testing situation. When analyzing all of the data baseline and post data, no adjustments for weather \nwere necessary.\nThe following report produces the utilization of the International Performance Measurement and \nVerification Protocol (IPMVP) as the M&V plan. Major Defense Contractor Facility Engineer [Client Representative] witnessed the \ncollection of all the data used in this report. The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global®’s \nForensic Mechanical Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer].  \nThe results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:\n \nkW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) \n \nBTUH = CFM * 4.5 (standard air) * Calculated Enthalpy Delta\n \nkW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage\n \nPercentage Eﬃciency = Measured BTUH / Manufacturers Design BTUH\n \nCoeﬃcient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412) \nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 563, "chars": 2555, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_093_chunk_0003", "next_id": "pdf_093_chunk_0005", "content_hash": "sha256:9ba932de9f6a42c5e674851c48115986d681ab3a8903ea511ac7c222c94b7e55"}

This greater capacity reduces the runtime hours and in turn \nreduces the annual kWh expended in the Post. The true ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the units \nwas when operating at their original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of tonnage and then \nsubtracting the new cost to run the units at this same newly restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM \nwas installed. This regression calculation is the most scientific method of accounting for the reduced number of hours \nthe units will now run due to their increased capacity which allows the units to reach set temperatures quicker and \nshut off sooner.  \nAvg.
