PermaFrost NMR® Eﬃciency Report
Major Defense Contractor
August, 2013
Executive Summary
         This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure (ECM) 
PermaFrost NMR® in the two CRAC (Computer Room Air Conditioning) units supporting a critical data 
center room within the Major Defense Contractor technical Services facility at [Virginia Facility Address]. Detailed 
forensic performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the two nominal 6-ton CRAC 
units using R410A refrigerant. Following testing, the CRAC units were treated with the proper amount and 
type of the PermaFrost NMR® technology specially formulated for these types of systems.  Measurement 
and Verification (M&V) was conducted pre-installation and post-gestation.
The improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly 
at the units was solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. 
This is a result of the reversal of thermal inefficiency on heat exchange surfaces.  
Following treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, the 
CRAC units showed an effective net average 29.5% reduction in 
kW/ton based on the exact capacity measured in the baseline M&V 
and the post gestation M&V. With each of the nominal 6-ton CRAC 
units operating at 100%, the units showed an average 23% reduction 
in kWh while simultaneously producing an average increase in 
system efficiency of 29.1%. Prior to the ECM, the units each produced 
an average of 4.76 tons of cooling as measured in-situ. After the ECM, 
the average tonnage produced increased to 6.07 tons or 104% of 
original design specification. This 27.5% average capacity increase 
and 33% improvement in refrigerant approach from the baseline 
performance levels led to an effective average increase in COP of 
31%. All of these factors directly correlate to what Major Defense Contractor will 
realize in energy savings as they operate these CRAC units in the 
future as well as other HVAC equipment like Roof Top Units and 
Chillers under the similar parameters.

Unit #8 on left was not put into service until 
Nov 2011 while Unit #9 on right has been in 
operation since 2007. The difference in age 
and total runtime clearly presented itself 
during the testing since both are key variables 
directly related to the amount thermal inefficiency in a 
system and the corresponding loss of 
performance over time.

Following treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, the two CRAC units also showed a slight 
reduction in measured Amps and Volts while at the same time producing more cooling. This is 
illustrated by the 26.9% increase in the enthalpy delta, which is a critical HVAC measurement used to 
determine the thermodynamic enhancement brought about by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result 
of the ECM improvement is an ROI to Major Defense Contractor that is measured in months. The tables of data used to 
determine the financial payback are available for review at the end of this report. 
  
Product Brief
         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure 
(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative® (NMR™) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, 
one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for at least 10 years in any 
type of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and 
equipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); 
chilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia 
refrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The 
equipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal 
(single and multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® in any type of HVACR system are improved cooling 
performance, increased capacity and improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to 
achieve set point temperatures in a more rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. 
The indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment 
include reduced run time, less kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life 
cycle time and a reduced carbon footprint for Major Defense Contractor.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) was utilized in the 
development of this report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating, 
Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization 
(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation 
methods and products.
There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They 
are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is 
defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single 
source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM 
affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term 
measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by 
short-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations 
using measurements of proxies of energy use. 
The final computation follows the formula:
Energy Science Division
Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy
+/ - Routine Adjustments +/ - Non-Routine Adjustments

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces. 
A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the operational 
conditions of the CRAC units were satisfactory. Baseline M&V were recorded on both units and then the 
proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected. The gestation period for the Major Defense Contractor pilot 
was 4 weeks on these particular units to allow them to achieve the required ~250 hours of runtime on each 
to ensure adequate performance improvement time. At the end of this gestation period, Post M&V results 
were taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same or very similar 
entering air dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures, entering condenser water temperatures (CDW), and of 
course outdoor air temperatures (OAT). These are three of the most critical variables to contend with in an 
in-situ testing situation. When analyzing all of the data baseline and post data, no adjustments for weather 
were necessary.
The following report produces the utilization of the International Performance Measurement and 
Verification Protocol (IPMVP) as the M&V plan. Major Defense Contractor Facility Engineer [Client Representative] witnessed the 
collection of all the data used in this report. The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global®’s 
Forensic Mechanical Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer].  
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
BTUH = CFM * 4.5 (standard air) * Calculated Enthalpy Delta
 
kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage
 
Percentage Eﬃciency = Measured BTUH / Manufacturers Design BTUH
 
Coeﬃcient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)

MEASUREMENT
Baseline and Post Measurements
The identical IPMVP following data points were recorded for Baseline and Post on 6/24/13 and 7/24/13 
respectively using recently NIST calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. The Return Air dry bulb 
and wet bulb temperatures entering the coil were very similar in both periods while the entering CDW was 2 
degrees cooler in the post but the OAT was 3 degrees warmer so no adjustments were made to the 
calculations. The measurements are as follows:

PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for Major Defense Contractor
Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Major Defense Contractor 
for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This greater capacity reduces the runtime hours and in turn 
reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post. The true ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the units 
was when operating at their original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of tonnage and then 
subtracting the new cost to run the units at this same newly restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM 
was installed. This regression calculation is the most scientific method of accounting for the reduced number of hours 
the units will now run due to their increased capacity which allows the units to reach set temperatures quicker and 
shut off sooner.  
Avg. Adjusted kW Baseline          1.257 kW/ton * 6.07 tons = 7.63 kW
Avg. Adjusted Baseline kWh          7.63 kW * 4,500 Annual Operating Hrs = 34,335 kWh
Avg. Revised Cost to Run Baseline          34,335 kWh * $.09 = $3,090.15
