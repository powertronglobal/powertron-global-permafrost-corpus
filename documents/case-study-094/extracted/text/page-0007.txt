MEASUREMENT
Baseline and Post Measurements
The identical IPMVP following data points were recorded for Baseline and Post on 6/24/13 and 7/24/13 
respectively using recently NIST calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. The Return Air dry bulb 
and wet bulb temperatures entering the coil were very similar in both periods while the entering CDW was 2 
degrees cooler in the post but the OAT was 3 degrees warmer so no adjustments were made to the 
calculations. The measurements are as follows:
