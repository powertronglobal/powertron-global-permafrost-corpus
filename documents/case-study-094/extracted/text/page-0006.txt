Detailed Results for CRAC Units 8 & 9
System Description / Design Characteristics
These units provide critical cooling for the 
Major Defense Contractor Technical Services Data Center located on 
the 1st floor of the facility located at 22230 Pacific 
Blvd, Sterling, VA. Given the internal load from the 
data center year round, it is estimated that each of 
the units ran ~4,500 hours or more each per year 
prior to the ECM being implemented.
