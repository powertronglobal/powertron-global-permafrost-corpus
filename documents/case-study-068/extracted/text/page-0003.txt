The improvements demonstrated in this or any field test resulting from PermaFrost NMR® are dependent on 
factors such as age, condition, service history, runtime of one or both compressors, and the design and 
operational application of each system. The results in this pilot were very consistent with 14+ year historical 
performance averages as well as the recent independent laboratory study completed in May, 2015 on DX 
equipment by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) in their testing chambers in [Texas Location], TX.
The data for each of the three pilot systems will be shown in separate sections. The corresponding certified 
T&B Company A measurements for each system will be listed in appendices A, B and C respectively.
