Testing Methodology
The M&V team used the aforementioned IPMVP methodology to capture the performance and energy use of 
the three pilot systems. First, after verifying the amount of air flowing across the evaporator coils in the DX 
equipment or water flowing through the evaporator barrel of the chiller before beginning each pilot phase, the 
subsequent measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with 
Option B of the IPMVP. This Protocol was developed by experts in the international community to provide a 
consistent method for analyzing HVAC/R system performance. Baseline measurements for the chiller and WIC 
were taken on November 24, 2015. Post measurements for these same two systems were taken on January 6, 
2016. The baseline for the split system was taken on this same day while the post measurements were taken on 
January 26, 2016.
 
The results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic 
engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor * Sq Rt 3 /1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• kW/ton = Actual Measured Energy / Actual Measured Capacity 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = 12 / (kW/ton) /3.412
 
• Tons of Cooling = (Measured CFM * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta T) / 12,000 BTU
 
• BTUs (Refrigeration) = (Airflow * 1.08 * Temp Δ)
