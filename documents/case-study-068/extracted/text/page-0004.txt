Highlights of the study:
When comparing the three HVAC systems before and after PermaFrost NMR® was installed, below are some of 
the highlights of the study:
 
• With PermaFrost NMR® all the benefits produced are directly linked to increasing capacity. When 
 
    initially tested, the pilot systems together were producing 197 tons of cooling. Following installation, 
 
    the cooling capacity jumped by 41 tons or 20.8% to 238 tons. 
 
• The overall cost to produce each ton of cooling on the chiller and split system on average dropped  
 
    21.9% from  1.28 kW/ton in the baseline to 1.0 kW/ton in the post. This means for every ton of the  
 
    two pilot systems are asked to produce, Space Center A Visitor Complex is spending 21.9% on average less to do so.
 
• The capacity improvement in the walk-in cooler increased by 84.9% going from 2,181 BTU/H to 4,033 
 
    BTU/H which resulted in a COP improvement of 118%.
 
• The projected annual kWh’s were reduced by 119,106 or 13.5%, from 879,235 to 760,129.
 
• The average cost to operate the three pilot systems dropped 13.5% from an average of $92,320 in the 
 
    baseline to $79,814 in the post. This reflects annual energy savings of $12,506.
The three HVAC systems involved in the pilot are recorded as follows:
