Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics for Pilot Chiller
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements and financial projections before and 
after the ECM was installed in the pilot chiller. These results may vary slightly from the tables listed earlier in 
this report due to rounding only to the first decimal position for cooling tons and kW values.
Average Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Capacity:  189 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline:  1.00 kW/ton * 227 tons = 227 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh:  227 kW * 3,500 Annual Operating Hours = 794,500 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 794,500 kWh * $.105 = $83,423
Average Post Energy Consumption
kW Post:  .885 kW/ton * 227 tons = 200.9 kW
Annual kWh Post:  200.9 kW * 3,500 hours = 703,150 kWh
Annual Cost Post:  703,150 kWh * $.105 cents = $73,831
Average Savings per Year Per System
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year:  $83,423 - $73,831 = $9,592
Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $9,592 / 12 = $799
Return on Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot chiller: $7,500
Estimated ROI for Space Center A Visitor Complex when treating the pilot chiller: $7,500 / $799 = ~9.4 mos
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 128%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 639%
Explanation of Regression Analysis
To obtain a realistic avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Space Center A Visitor Complex for implementing the PermaFrost 
NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy savings resulting from the improvement 
in both capacity and efficiency utilizing data collected during the pilot study. These improvements reduce the annual kWh 
expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller was when 
operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available capacity before then subtracting 
the revised cost to run the chiller at the same restored capacity after the ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the 
most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or load % at which the chiller will now 
operate due to the restored performance profile. If the building control system and associated air handler units are operating 
normally, this restored performance profile will normally allow the chiller to satisfy the internal area set points with 
increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
