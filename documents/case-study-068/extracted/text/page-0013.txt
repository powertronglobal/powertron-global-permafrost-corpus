Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics for Pilot Split System
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements and financial projections before and 
after the ECM was installed in the pilot split system. These results may vary slightly from the tables listed 
earlier in this report due to rounding only to the first decimal position for cooling tons and kW values.
Average Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Capacity:  7.74 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline:  1.56 kW/ton * 10.56 tons = 16.5 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh:  16.5 kW * 4,370 Annual Operating Hours = 72,105 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 72,105 kWh * $.105 = $7,571
Average Post Energy Consumption
kW Post:  1.11 kW/ton * 10.56 tons = 11.7 kW
Annual kWh Post:  11.7 kW * 4,370 hours = 51,129 kWh
Annual Cost Post:  51,129 kWh * $.105 cents = $5,369
Average Savings per Year Per System
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year:  $7,571 - $5,369 = $2,202
Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $2,202 / 12 = $184
Return on Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot split system: $1,250
Estimated ROI for Space Center A Visitor Complex when treating the pilot split system: $1,250 / $184 = ~6.8 mos
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 176%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 881%
Explanation of Regression Analysis
To obtain a realistic avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Space Center A Visitor Complex for implementing the PermaFrost 
NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy savings resulting from the improvement 
in both capacity and efficiency utilizing data collected during the pilot study. These improvements reduce the annual kWh 
expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the split system was when 
operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available capacity before then subtracting 
the revised cost to run the split system at the same restored capacity after the ECM was installed. This regression analysis 
is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or load % at which the split system 
will now operate due to the restored performance profile.
