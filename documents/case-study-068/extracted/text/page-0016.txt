Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics for Pilot WIC
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements and financial projections before and 
after the ECM was installed in the pilot WIC. These results may vary slightly from the tables listed earlier in this 
report due to rounding only to the first decimal position for cooling tons and kW values.
Average Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Capacity:  .182 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline:  12.54 kW/ton * .336 tons = 4.21 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh:  4.21 kW * 3,000 Annual Operating Hours = 12,630 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 12,630 kWh * $.105 = $1,326
Average Post Energy Consumption
kW Post:  5.8 kW/ton * .336 tons = 1.95 kW
Annual kWh Post:  1.95 kW * 3,000 hours = 5,850 kWh
Annual Cost Post:  5,850 kWh * $.105 cents = $614
Average Savings per Year Per Unit
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year:  $1,326 - $614 = $712
Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $712 / 12 = $59
Return on Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot WIC: $250
Estimated ROI for Space Center A Visitor Complex when treating the pilot WIC: $250 / $59 = ~4.2 mos
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 284%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 1,424%
Explanation of Regression Analysis
To obtain a realistic avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Space Center A Visitor Complex for implementing the PermaFrost 
NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy savings resulting from the improvement 
in both capacity and efficiency utilizing data collected during the pilot study. These improvements reduce the annual kWh 
expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the WIC was when operating 
at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available capacity before then subtracting the revised 
cost to run the WIC at the same restored capacity after the ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely 
accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or load % at which the WIC will now operate due to 
the restored performance profile.
