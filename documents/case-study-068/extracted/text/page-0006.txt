Improved Unit Cost Following ECM
The “Unit Cost” in the HVAC industry is the kW/ton ratio. 
KW/ton is commonly used for larger commercial and 
industrial air conditioning, heat pump and refrigeration 
systems. It is the HVAC industry’s standard of determining 
how much energy is required to create a single ton of 
cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you reduce the unit 
cost of cooling you are saving energy regardless of how 
much overall cooling is required.
The chart to the right clearly illustrates the amount of 
efficiency restoration the ECM created in the pilot chiller 
after treatment. The treated chiller is now performing 11.5% 
more efficiently than before being treated. This degradation 
in operational efficiency was costing Space Center A Visitor Complex a substantial 
amount of money in wasted energy.  This improvement 
comes in spite of a bad condensing fan that kept locking up 
during the post collection period causing the current and 
discharge pressures to be falsely elevated. Once the fan 
motor is replaced the kW/ton will improve even more.
