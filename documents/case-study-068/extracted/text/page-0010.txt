Improved Unit Cost Following ECM
The “Unit Cost” in the HVAC industry is the kW/ton ratio. 
KW/ton is commonly used for larger commercial and 
industrial air conditioning, heat pump and refrigeration 
systems. It is the HVAC industry’s standard of determining 
how much energy is required to create a single ton of 
cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you reduce the unit 
cost of cooling you are saving energy regardless of how 
much overall cooling is required.
The chart to the right clearly illustrates the amount of 
efficiency restoration the ECM created in the pilot split 
system after treatment. The treated system is now 
performing 28.8% more efficiently than before being 
treated. This degradation in operational efficiency was 
costing Space Center A Visitor Complex a substantial amount of money in wasted 
energy.
