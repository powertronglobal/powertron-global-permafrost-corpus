This study looked at three common types of HVAC/R equipment supporting the Space Center A Visitor Complex as \nwell as the majority of the other properties Hospitality Management Company manages and operates for clients. The equipment \ntested included a 240-ton air cooled chiller, a 10-ton split system, and and a small walk-in cooler (WIC).\nAll the measurements for this pilot were taken and certified by Test & Balance Company A (T&B Company A), a \nhighly respected Test & Balance company based in Lutz, FL.  All testing followed the International \nMeasurement and Verification Protocols (IPMVP). The IPMVP is endorsed by the US Department of Energy as \nthe best method for measuring capacity, performance and efficiency of HVAC/R systems in-situ. \nT&B Company A took care to use the same certified test equipment and measure in the same fashion under identical \nweather conditions in both the baseline and post collection periods. This ensured that all the benefits produced \ncould definitively be attributed to the PermaFrost NMR® energy conservation measure (ECM). \nOverview\nRunning from November 24, 2015 to January 26, 2016, the pilot was designed to illustrate the positive impact \nPermaFrost NMR® would have on the capacity, performance and overall efficiency measured in kW/ton and \nCOP of the three pilot HVAC/R systems.\nAs demonstrated in this field trial, PermaFrost NMR® restores the capacity on the HVAC/R systems that has \nbeen lost over time due to fouling of the heat exchange surfaces. The ECM will immediately benefit Space Center A Visitor Complex in \nany or all of the following ways:\n \n• Restoring capacity of the systems to satisfy fluctuating building loads or lower room temps\n \n• Producing additional system redundancy at no extra cost or interruption to operations \n \n• Improving system efficiency, lowering cost to produce each ton of cooling required (kW/ton & COP)\n \n• Restoring thermal efficiency, allowing systems to achieve thermostat set points faster, reducing runtime \n \n   and extending equipment life \n \n• Reducing annual kWh usage by the HVAC systems \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 805, "chars": 3696, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_063_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:165f09cd25d52f567c60041df49d64b268f85e4b6534f027e4ed3093f8453efd"}

The results in this pilot were very consistent with 14+ year historical \nperformance averages as well as the recent independent laboratory study completed in May, 2015 on DX \nequipment by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) in their testing chambers in [Texas Location], TX.\nThe data for each of the three pilot systems will be shown in separate sections.

When \n \n    initially tested, the pilot systems together were producing 197 tons of cooling. Following installation, \n \n    the cooling capacity jumped by 41 tons or 20.8% to 238 tons. \n \n• The overall cost to produce each ton of cooling on the chiller and split system on average dropped  \n \n    21.9% from  1.28 kW/ton in the baseline to 1.0 kW/ton in the post. This means for every ton of the  \n \n    two pilot systems are asked to produce, Space Center A Visitor Complex is spending 21.9% on average less to do so.\n \n• The capacity improvement in the walk-in cooler increased by 84.9% going from 2,181 BTU/H to 4,033 \n \n    BTU/H which resulted in a COP improvement of 118%.\n \n• The projected annual kWh’s were reduced by 119,106 or 13.5%, from 879,235 to 760,129.\n \n• The average cost to operate the three pilot systems dropped 13.5% from an average of $92,320 in the \n \n    baseline to $79,814 in the post. This reflects annual energy savings of $12,506.\nThe three HVAC systems involved in the pilot are recorded as follows:\nHVAC Equipment Manufacturer Chiller, Mfg date: 2006, R22, Nominal 250-tons, 480V/3Ph, Model RTAC250\nCarrier Split, Mfg date: 2003, R22, Nominal 10-tons, 480V/3Ph, Model 38ARS012\nWitt WIC, Mfg date: 2001, R22, Single fan Evaporator\n  \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 536, "chars": 2030, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_063_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_063_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:507fa3ee3c671dfae7d7c21c77417eaa739d82b49e97cfcdd17539b8b495e1bf"}

First, after verifying the amount of air flowing across the evaporator coils in the DX \nequipment or water flowing through the evaporator barrel of the chiller before beginning each pilot phase, the \nsubsequent measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with \nOption B of the IPMVP. This Protocol was developed by experts in the international community to provide a \nconsistent method for analyzing HVAC/R system performance. Baseline measurements for the chiller and WIC \nwere taken on November 24, 2015. Post measurements for these same two systems were taken on January 6, \n2016. The baseline for the split system was taken on this same day while the post measurements were taken on \nJanuary 26, 2016.\n \nThe results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic \nengineering formulas:\n \n• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor * Sq Rt 3 /1000 (for 3-Phase) \n \n• kW/ton = Actual Measured Energy / Actual Measured Capacity \n \n• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = 12 / (kW/ton) /3.412\n \n• Tons of Cooling = (Measured CFM * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta T) / 12,000 BTU\n \n• BTUs (Refrigeration) = (Airflow * 1.08 * Temp Δ)\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 439, "chars": 1880, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_063_chunk_0003", "next_id": "pdf_063_chunk_0005", "content_hash": "sha256:00a3dbdb096b5adcb8a7538298cc59cbdb6098505df197f862d6558d2122de00"}

The treated chiller is now performing 11.5% \nmore efficiently than before being treated. This degradation \nin operational efficiency was costing Space Center A Visitor Complex a substantial \namount of money in wasted energy.  This improvement \ncomes in spite of a bad condensing fan that kept locking up \nduring the post collection period causing the current and \ndischarge pressures to be falsely elevated.
