Background
This report details the results of the recently completed comprehensive energy performance pilot study 
conducted at the Space Center A Visitor Complex (Space Center A Visitor Complex) located along the NASA Causeway in 
Titusville, Florida.  This study looked at three common types of HVAC/R equipment supporting the Space Center A Visitor Complex as 
well as the majority of the other properties Hospitality Management Company manages and operates for clients. The equipment 
tested included a 240-ton air cooled chiller, a 10-ton split system, and and a small walk-in cooler (WIC).
All the measurements for this pilot were taken and certified by Test & Balance Company A (T&B Company A), a 
highly respected Test & Balance company based in Lutz, FL.  All testing followed the International 
Measurement and Verification Protocols (IPMVP). The IPMVP is endorsed by the US Department of Energy as 
the best method for measuring capacity, performance and efficiency of HVAC/R systems in-situ. 
T&B Company A took care to use the same certified test equipment and measure in the same fashion under identical 
weather conditions in both the baseline and post collection periods. This ensured that all the benefits produced 
could definitively be attributed to the PermaFrost NMR® energy conservation measure (ECM). 
Overview
Running from November 24, 2015 to January 26, 2016, the pilot was designed to illustrate the positive impact 
PermaFrost NMR® would have on the capacity, performance and overall efficiency measured in kW/ton and 
COP of the three pilot HVAC/R systems.
As demonstrated in this field trial, PermaFrost NMR® restores the capacity on the HVAC/R systems that has 
been lost over time due to fouling of the heat exchange surfaces. The ECM will immediately benefit Space Center A Visitor Complex in 
any or all of the following ways:
 
• Restoring capacity of the systems to satisfy fluctuating building loads or lower room temps
 
• Producing additional system redundancy at no extra cost or interruption to operations 
 
• Improving system efficiency, lowering cost to produce each ton of cooling required (kW/ton & COP)
 
• Restoring thermal efficiency, allowing systems to achieve thermostat set points faster, reducing runtime 
 
   and extending equipment life 
 
• Reducing annual kWh usage by the HVAC systems

The improvements demonstrated in this or any field test resulting from PermaFrost NMR® are dependent on 
factors such as age, condition, service history, runtime of one or both compressors, and the design and 
operational application of each system. The results in this pilot were very consistent with 14+ year historical 
performance averages as well as the recent independent laboratory study completed in May, 2015 on DX 
equipment by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) in their testing chambers in [Texas Location], TX.
The data for each of the three pilot systems will be shown in separate sections. The corresponding certified 
T&B Company A measurements for each system will be listed in appendices A, B and C respectively.

Highlights of the study:
When comparing the three HVAC systems before and after PermaFrost NMR® was installed, below are some of 
the highlights of the study:
 
• With PermaFrost NMR® all the benefits produced are directly linked to increasing capacity. When 
 
    initially tested, the pilot systems together were producing 197 tons of cooling. Following installation, 
 
    the cooling capacity jumped by 41 tons or 20.8% to 238 tons. 
 
• The overall cost to produce each ton of cooling on the chiller and split system on average dropped  
 
    21.9% from  1.28 kW/ton in the baseline to 1.0 kW/ton in the post. This means for every ton of the  
 
    two pilot systems are asked to produce, Space Center A Visitor Complex is spending 21.9% on average less to do so.
 
• The capacity improvement in the walk-in cooler increased by 84.9% going from 2,181 BTU/H to 4,033 
 
    BTU/H which resulted in a COP improvement of 118%.
 
• The projected annual kWh’s were reduced by 119,106 or 13.5%, from 879,235 to 760,129.
 
• The average cost to operate the three pilot systems dropped 13.5% from an average of $92,320 in the 
 
    baseline to $79,814 in the post. This reflects annual energy savings of $12,506.
The three HVAC systems involved in the pilot are recorded as follows:
HVAC Equipment Manufacturer Chiller, Mfg date: 2006, R22, Nominal 250-tons, 480V/3Ph, Model RTAC250
Carrier Split, Mfg date: 2003, R22, Nominal 10-tons, 480V/3Ph, Model 38ARS012

Testing Methodology
The M&V team used the aforementioned IPMVP methodology to capture the performance and energy use of 
the three pilot systems. First, after verifying the amount of air flowing across the evaporator coils in the DX 
equipment or water flowing through the evaporator barrel of the chiller before beginning each pilot phase, the 
subsequent measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with 
Option B of the IPMVP. This Protocol was developed by experts in the international community to provide a 
consistent method for analyzing HVAC/R system performance. Baseline measurements for the chiller and WIC 
were taken on November 24, 2015. Post measurements for these same two systems were taken on January 6, 
2016. The baseline for the split system was taken on this same day while the post measurements were taken on 
January 26, 2016.
 
The results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic 
engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor * Sq Rt 3 /1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• kW/ton = Actual Measured Energy / Actual Measured Capacity 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = 12 / (kW/ton) /3.412
 
• Tons of Cooling = (Measured CFM * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta T) / 12,000 BTU
 
• BTUs (Refrigeration) = (Airflow * 1.08 * Temp Δ)

Improved Unit Cost Following ECM
The “Unit Cost” in the HVAC industry is the kW/ton ratio. 
KW/ton is commonly used for larger commercial and 
industrial air conditioning, heat pump and refrigeration 
systems. It is the HVAC industry’s standard of determining 
how much energy is required to create a single ton of 
cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you reduce the unit 
cost of cooling you are saving energy regardless of how 
much overall cooling is required.
The chart to the right clearly illustrates the amount of 
efficiency restoration the ECM created in the pilot chiller 
after treatment. The treated chiller is now performing 11.5% 
more efficiently than before being treated. This degradation 
in operational efficiency was costing Space Center A Visitor Complex a substantial 
amount of money in wasted energy.  This improvement 
comes in spite of a bad condensing fan that kept locking up 
during the post collection period causing the current and 
discharge pressures to be falsely elevated. Once the fan 
motor is replaced the kW/ton will improve even more.

Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics for Pilot Chiller
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements and financial projections before and 
after the ECM was installed in the pilot chiller. These results may vary slightly from the tables listed earlier in 
this report due to rounding only to the first decimal position for cooling tons and kW values.
Average Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Capacity:  189 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline:  1.00 kW/ton * 227 tons = 227 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh:  227 kW * 3,500 Annual Operating Hours = 794,500 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 794,500 kWh * $.105 = $83,423
Average Post Energy Consumption
kW Post:  .885 kW/ton * 227 tons = 200.9 kW
Annual kWh Post:  200.9 kW * 3,500 hours = 703,150 kWh
Annual Cost Post:  703,150 kWh * $.105 cents = $73,831
Average Savings per Year Per System
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year:  $83,423 - $73,831 = $9,592
Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $9,592 / 12 = $799
Return on Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot chiller: $7,500
Estimated ROI for Space Center A Visitor Complex when treating the pilot chiller: $7,500 / $799 = ~9.4 mos
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 128%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 639%
Explanation of Regression Analysis
To obtain a realistic avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Space Center A Visitor Complex for implementing the PermaFrost 
NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy savings resulting from the improvement 
in both capacity and efficiency utilizing data collected during the pilot study. These improvements reduce the annual kWh 
expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller was when 
operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available capacity before then subtracting 
the revised cost to run the chiller at the same restored capacity after the ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the 
most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or load % at which the chiller will now 
operate due to the restored performance profile. If the building control system and associated air handler units are operating 
normally, this restored performance profile will normally allow the chiller to satisfy the internal area set points with 
increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.

Average Savings per Year Per Unit
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year:  $1,326 - $614 = $712
Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $712 / 12 = $59
Return on Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot WIC: $250
Estimated ROI for Space Center A Visitor Complex when treating the pilot WIC: $250 / $59 = ~4.2 mos
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 284%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 1,424%
Explanation of Regression Analysis
To obtain a realistic avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Space Center A Visitor Complex for implementing the PermaFrost 
NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy savings resulting from the improvement 
in both capacity and efficiency utilizing data collected during the pilot study. These improvements reduce the annual kWh 
expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the WIC was when operating 
at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available capacity before then subtracting the revised 
cost to run the WIC at the same restored capacity after the ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely 
accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or load % at which the WIC will now operate due to 
the restored performance profile.
