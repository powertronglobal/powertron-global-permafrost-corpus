Methodology
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the 
IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted [Chief Engineer] 
Chief Engineer with Commercial Real Estate Services and Major Global Bank, [Client Representative] P.E. with Energy Consulting Partner 
and Powertron Global’s Director of Engineering, [Senior Energy Engineer].  
Notes
The equipment tested 1350 water-cooled chiller manufactured by HVAC Equipment Manufacturer.  Both the baseline and post measurement s were 
taken with outside air temperatures of 81-82 degrees F.  
The flow rate through the evaporator was set close to design specifications in the baseline and post and the return chilled 
water entering the chiller in the baseline and post were identical so no adjustments were made.
The boundary of the testing was the chiller and nothing else; therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance 
calculations is very high.
