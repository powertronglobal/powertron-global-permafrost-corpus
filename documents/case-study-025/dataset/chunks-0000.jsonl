Many industry leading \norganizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they \nage. Thermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVAC/R equipment that operates \nas a vapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is \nwell documented by the HVAC/R industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal \ndegradation prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times \nand additional kWh consumption.\nThe chillers in this study is representative of their portfolio of chiller equipment operated by Major Global Bank. If thermal \ndegradation is present in these chillers, it is present in the entire inventory of equipment. Energy waste can be \ncalculated based on this equipment (portfolio representation) and then accurately extrapolated across the entire \ninventory of equipment.\n.\nProcess\nThis report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of three (3) chillers that \nsupport the Major Global Bank location in Mississauga, Ontario.\nDetailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on each chiller before and after the \ninstallation of the ECM to determine the impact on the three key elements:\n \n1.  The cooling capacity the chiller produces after 10 years in service, before and after the administration \n     of the ECM. \n2.  The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the chiller can deliver as \n     reflected in the kW/ton measurement, before and after the administration of the ECM. \n3.  The thermal dynamic ability of the chiller to perform in relation to operational design, before and \n     after the administration of the ECM.\nThis report is provided to Major Global Bank.

The team consisted Steve Denzau \nChief Engineer, and Powertron Global’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer]\nNotes \nThe equipment tested were three (3) water-cooled chillers manufactured by McQuay. Both baseline and post measurement \ns were taken in the identical manner.\nThe flow rate through the evaporator was matched in the baseline and post. The condenser water entering the chiller in the \nbaseline and post were normalized. According to the manufacturer, for each degree different in the post versus the baseline \nthe capacity was either increased or decreased .25% per degree.\nThe boundary of the testing was at each chiller therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance calculations is high.\nThis report is provided to Major Global Bank.

The delta of these measurements and associated calculations demonstrate \nthe amount of thermal capacity recovery.\nThe flow of the evaporator and condenser were measured using NIST calibrated instruments (National Institutes of \nStandards and Technology) for the verification of accurate GPM measurement. \nThe remaining measurements were obtained locally from the chiller control panel. The chillers were then treated with \nPermaFrost NMR® on the same day and allowed to run normally to ensure the patented surface science nanotechnology \nhad ample time to become assimilated into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All critical measurements were \ntaken at similar incoming condenser water temperatures as well as outdoor air temperatures however routine adjustments \nto normalize the capacity due to warmer or cooler entering condenser temperatures were applied as per the IPMVP \nprotocol.\n \nThis report is provided to Major Global Bank.
