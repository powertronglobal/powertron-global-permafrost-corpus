HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report

Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study

The purpose of this study is to verify the industry wide problem of efficiency loss in HVAC/R as projected by

ASHRAE research and to quantify the amount of money wasted due to this loss. Many industry leading

organizations including ASHRAE project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they

age. Thermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVAC/R equipment that operates

as a vapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is

well documented by the HVAC/R industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal

degradation prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times

and additional kWh consumption.

The chillers in this study is representative of their portfolio of chiller equipment operated by Major Global Bank. If thermal

degradation is present in these chillers, it is present in the entire inventory of equipment. Energy waste can be

calculated based on this equipment (portfolio representation) and then accurately extrapolated across the entire

inventory of equipment.

.

Process

This report contains specific information regarding the current performance profile of three (3) chillers that

support the Major Global Bank location in Mississauga, Ontario.

Detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on each chiller before and after the

installation of the ECM to determine the impact on the three key elements:

1.  The cooling capacity the chiller produces after 10 years in service, before and after the administration

of the ECM.

2.  The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the chiller can deliver as

reflected in the kW/ton measurement, before and after the administration of the ECM.

3.  The thermal dynamic ability of the chiller to perform in relation to operational design, before and

after the administration of the ECM.

Methodology

The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the

IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted Steve Denzau

Chief Engineer, and Powertron Global’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer]

Notes

The equipment tested were three (3) water-cooled chillers manufactured by McQuay. Both baseline and post measurement

s were taken in the identical manner.

The flow rate through the evaporator was matched in the baseline and post. The condenser water entering the chiller in the

baseline and post were normalized. According to the manufacturer, for each degree different in the post versus the baseline

the capacity was either increased or decreased .25% per degree.

The boundary of the testing was at each chiller therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance calculations is high.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)

The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the treated chillers to perform prior to

the ECM being installed, as well as illustrate the thermal degradation that naturally occurs in heat exchangers over time.

The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP as the M&V plan.

The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:

• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor * √3/1000 (for 3-Phase)

• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage

• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)

• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU

Notes

Following a diagnostic examination to determine the operational condition of the chillers was satisfactory, baseline M&V

data was collected and recorded.  500+ runtime hours after installation of the ECM, we returned on very similar weather

days to assure compliant weather conditions as compared to the Baseline for the purpose of obtaining post M&V

measurements as was performed in the Baseline. The delta of these measurements and associated calculations demonstrate

the amount of thermal capacity recovery.

The flow of the evaporator and condenser were measured using NIST calibrated instruments (National Institutes of

Standards and Technology) for the verification of accurate GPM measurement.

The remaining measurements were obtained locally from the chiller control panel. The chillers were then treated with

PermaFrost NMR® on the same day and allowed to run normally to ensure the patented surface science nanotechnology

had ample time to become assimilated into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All critical measurements were

taken at similar incoming condenser water temperatures as well as outdoor air temperatures however routine adjustments

to normalize the capacity due to warmer or cooler entering condenser temperatures were applied as per the IPMVP

protocol.

Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results 
Chiller Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM

Major Global Bank has the problem of thermal degradation in its Chiller systems. The lower operating tonnage and COP

ratings measured on site are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. The

degraded equipment performance is costing Major Global Bank Properties significant money and wasting energy. The treated

chillers were using significantly more energy to operate than when they were new.

The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the chillers in the baseline and

post testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation.

The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 375 operating tons and an average

improvement of 62.5% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the

chiller throughout the year.

Recovered Wasted Energy with ECM - Chiller

The chart below illustrates the performance restoration the ECM created in the treated chillers. The average

cost to operate these chillers before they were treated with PermaFrost NMR® as calculated in kW/ton was

0.76.

The specific cost to operate these chillers after they

were treated with PermaFrost NMR® as calculated

in kW/ton is currently 0.46.

The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured

in-situ was expected when compared to the

ASHRAE loss of performance efficiency and cost to

operate estimate for an average 21-year old chillers

utilizing R -134A refrigerant. The post results are

also in line with the average improvement savings

shown over more than 130,000 installations

globally.

Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics

The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR®

Post measurement period for the three (3) Major Global Bank Canada Cards chillers combined.

Baseline Energy Consumption

Baseline Tonnage: 798.1tons

Adjusted kW Baseline: .76kW/ton * 1,173.2 tons = 891.6 kW

Adjusted Baseline kWh: 891.6 kW * 1,785 Annual Operating Hrs = 1,591,506 kWh

Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 1,591,506 kWh * $.153 = $243,500

Post Energy Consumption

kW Post: .46 kW/ton * 1,173.2 tons = 539.7 kW

Annual kWh Post: 539.7 kW * 1,785 hours = 963,365 kWh

Annual Cost Post: 963,365 kWh * .153 cents = $147,395

Savings Per Year

Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $243,500- $147,395= $96,105

Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $96,105 / 12 = $8009

Return On Investment

Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in all three (3) chillers: $16,386

Estimated ROI Period for Major Global Bank on the chillers: $16,386 / $8,009 = 2 months

Annual Rate of Return = 586.5%

Return on Investment Over 10 Years = 5,865%

Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period

for Major Global Bank for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true

energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This restored capacity reduces the annual kWh expended

in the Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller was when operating at the

original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the

revised cost to run the chiller at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed. This

regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours or load the

chillers will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the chiller to reach the internal

building set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
