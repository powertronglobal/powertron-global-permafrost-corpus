Recovered Wasted Energy with ECM - Chiller 
The chart below illustrates the performance restoration the ECM created in the treated chillers. The average 
cost to operate these chillers before they were treated with PermaFrost NMR® as calculated in kW/ton was 
0.76.
The specific cost to operate these chillers after they 
were treated with PermaFrost NMR® as calculated 
in kW/ton is currently 0.46.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured 
in-situ was expected when compared to the 
ASHRAE loss of performance efficiency and cost to 
operate estimate for an average 21-year old chillers 
utilizing R -134A refrigerant. The post results are 
also in line with the average improvement savings 
shown over more than 130,000 installations 
globally.
