Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the three (3) Major Global Bank Canada Cards chillers combined.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 798.1tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: .76kW/ton * 1,173.2 tons = 891.6 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 891.6 kW * 1,785 Annual Operating Hrs = 1,591,506 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 1,591,506 kWh * $.153 = $243,500
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: .46 kW/ton * 1,173.2 tons = 539.7 kW
Annual kWh Post: 539.7 kW * 1,785 hours = 963,365 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 963,365 kWh * .153 cents = $147,395
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $243,500- $147,395= $96,105
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $96,105 / 12 = $8009
Return On Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in all three (3) chillers: $16,386
Estimated ROI Period for Major Global Bank on the chillers: $16,386 / $8,009 = 2 months
Annual Rate of Return = 586.5%
Return on Investment Over 10 Years = 5,865%
 
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period 
for Major Global Bank for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true 
energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This restored capacity reduces the annual kWh expended 
in the Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the chiller was when operating at the 
original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the 
revised cost to run the chiller at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed. This 
regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours or load the 
chillers will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the chiller to reach the internal 
building set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
