Methodology
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the 
IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. The team consisted Steve Denzau 
Chief Engineer, and Powertron Global’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer]
Notes 
The equipment tested were three (3) water-cooled chillers manufactured by McQuay. Both baseline and post measurement 
s were taken in the identical manner.
The flow rate through the evaporator was matched in the baseline and post. The condenser water entering the chiller in the 
baseline and post were normalized. According to the manufacturer, for each degree different in the post versus the baseline 
the capacity was either increased or decreased .25% per degree.
The boundary of the testing was at each chiller therefore confidence in the accuracy of the performance calculations is high.
