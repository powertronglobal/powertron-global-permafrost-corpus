Energy Reporting Period (Post)
The identical IPMVP data recordings from the baseline (including insertion depths with probes) were 
recorded on 9/20/2012 using the same recently NIST calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. 
Given the 1% warmer outdoor temperature in the Post, the compressor Amps (70% of the total Amps) were 
adjusted downward by 1%.  This adjustment permeates through to the Post Watts as well as the Watts per 
Ton.  The measurements are as follows:

The following are the final calculated performance measurements (detailed below the chart) after performing 
the regression analysis to account to the restored capacity brought about by PermaFrost NMR®.
