Performance Report on PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Bridgestone-Major Tire Manufacturer
September 21, 2012
Executive Summary
        This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure (ECM) 
PermaFrost NMR® at three Bridgestone-Major Tire Manufacturer (BS-FS) locations in the [Florida Location] metro area. The North 
Florida and Bradenton stores each have 15-ton HVAC units.  The Hanley Rd store has two 5-ton HVAC 
units.  All four of the units involved in the pilot were treated while detailed forensic performance testing 
(outlined later in this report) was performed on one unit at each location.  The units tested were all 
packaged rooftop units using R22 refrigerant and totaling 35 tons. 
The substantial improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at the units was solely 
attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The units now provide cooler supply air with greater efficiency 
due to the restoration of the heat transfer ability of the evaporator and condenser coils, both of which have a 
direct correlation to an increase in the number of Btuh the machines are now capable of producing.  
Total system efficiency across all three tested units improved by an average of 22.5%, while the EER across 
the units rose by 22.1%.  There was an overall increase in coil capacity of 77,778 Btuh, equating to the 
restoration of 6.5-tons of capacity or 23.7%. There is also a reduction of 17.1% in both total power and watts 
per ton, which is another measurable way to view the thermodynamic enhancement of the PermaFrost 
NMR® ECM.  The result of the average ECM improvements is an ROI to BS-FS of just 16.1 months based on 
the runtime information listed.  The tables of data and financial calculations are available for review at the 
end of this report.

Product Brief
         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure 
(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) technology as its core agent.  A sustainable, 
one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any 
type of system in which it is installed – DX (direct expansion air and chilled water systems), Chillers 
(screw, reciprocating, scroll and centrifugal), heat pumps, ice making equipment. Specialized 
applications include computer room cooling and dehumidification systems, chiller plants (water and 
ice production applications), domestic and industrial refrigeration (ammonia low and ultra low 
temperature), air-cooled single application water chillers and split and package rooftop HVAC 
equipment.
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and 
improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allows a system to achieve set point temperatures in a more 
rapid fashion which reduces system loading and operating periods.  The indirect benefits resulting 
from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less 
kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, less metallic wear, longer overall equipment life and 
a reduced carbon footprint.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocols (IPMVP) are used to develop this 
report.  The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and 
Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the 
IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and 
products.
There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize.  They 
are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.  Option B is 
defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (Permafrost NMR®) as the single 
source of measurement.  Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM 
affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term 
measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained.  The savings are calculated by 
short-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using 
measurements of proxies of energy use. 
The final computation follows the formula:
Energy Science Division
Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy
+ - Routine adjustments + - Non-Routine Adjustments

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces. 
A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the unit’s operational 
conditions were satisfactory.  Baseline measurements were recorded and then the proper amount and type 
of PermaFrost NMR® was injected.  The product was then allowed four (4) weeks to seat itself into the 
metal surfaces before post measurements were taken again to establish the efficiency gains. 
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP International Performance Measurement and 
Verification Protocol as the M&V plan.  The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global’s Senior 
Energy Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer], ME/CEM/CMC/CMVP.
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
kW = Volts * Amps * 1.47 (Power Factor .85 *1.732) - for 3-Phase  
 
Delta T = Return Air DB – Supply Air DB
 
Enthalpy = Return Air WB Deg. F and Supply Air WB Deg. F Converted to Enthalpy
 
Actual Btuh Capacity = Measured CFM * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta (Baseline – Post) 
 
System Eﬃciency % = Actual Coil Capacity Btuh / Nominal Coil Capacity Btuh
 
EER = Btuh / Adjusted Watts

Energy Reporting Period (Post)
The identical IPMVP data recordings from the baseline (including insertion depths with probes) were 
recorded on 9/20/2012 using the same recently NIST calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. 
Given the 1% warmer outdoor temperature in the Post, the compressor Amps (70% of the total Amps) were 
adjusted downward by 1%.  This adjustment permeates through to the Post Watts as well as the Watts per 
Ton.  The measurements are as follows:

Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to determine a very accurate ROI for 
BS-FS for implementing this ECM:
Baseline kWh = (15,565 CTW / 1,000) * 4,380 Annual Operating Hrs = 68,175 kWh
Baseline Cost To Run = 68,175 kWh * $.115 = $7,840
Regression Analysis is then used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Pilot Unit 
Adjusted Base Tonnage = 14.64 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted Total Watts = 1,190 WPT * 14.64 tons = 17,422 TW
Adjusted Base kWh = (17,422 TW/1,000) * 4,380 Annual Operating Hrs = 76,308 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM = 76,308 kWh * $.115 = $8,775
Post ECM kWh = (15,241 NTW / 1,000) * 4,380 Annual Operating Hrs = 66,756 kWh
Cost to Run After ECM = 66,756 kWh * $.115 = $7,677
Cost Savings per Month = ($8,775 - $7,677) / 12 = $91.50
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed @ $1,875 / $91.50 = 20.5
 
ROI = 20.5 months
