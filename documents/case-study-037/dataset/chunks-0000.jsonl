This second successful study focused on actual kWh savings (Caribbean Telecom Provider energy \nmeter) and capacity improvements (IPMVP) on two more Liebert systems. \nThe identiﬁcation of cooling systems involved in the study are recorded as follows:\n•(2) 24-ton Emerson/Liebert CRAC, Mfg date: 2003, R-22, 408 volt-3 Phase, Model DH290A-GGEI\nECM Product Brief\nPermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented surface science nanotechnology that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative \n(NMR®) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost \nNMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type of climate control system in which it is installed. The direct benefits \nof PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling efficiency and increased capacity, both of which result in lower overall \ncosts to operate a system and extended equipment life.\nThis report is provided to Caribbean Telecom Group.

The first method was to install a Fluke power meter at the electrical panel in the same \nroom as the CRAC units. The meter captured the power usage of both CRAC units as well as the condensing \nunits associated with them. The second method was to measure the CRAC units in accordance with AHRI and \nOption B of the industry best practice International Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) \nframework. \nThe results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:\n \n• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor * 1.732/1000 (for 3-Phase) \n \n• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage \n \n• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)\n \n• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = (Measured CFM * 4.5 Enthalpy Delta T)/ 12,000 BTU \nResults from the Study\nUsing the two data collection methodologies outlined above, the key results from the pilot are as follows:\n \n• Annual Energy use for the two CRAC units, as captured on the Caribbean Telecom Provider energy meter, fell 6.8% or \n \n   17,112 kWh’s\n \n• Average Max Current (Amps) for the two CRAC units, as captured on the Caribbean Telecom Provider energy meter, fell \n \n   20.4% from 88.63 to 70.52\n \n• Annual cost to operate the two CRAC units was reduced by $4,278, equating to a 12.6 month payback*\n \n• Total capacity of the two pilot CRAC units increased by 19.4% from 28.8 tons to 34.4 tons\n \n• kW/ton rating (i.e., the cost for every ton of cooling produced) was reduced by 18.5% from 1.19 to .97 \n \n   kW/ton\n*While $.16 cents was the targeted price in Dec 2015, the price of oil has more than doubled since that time\nThis report is provided to Caribbean Telecom Group.

KW/ton is commonly used for larger commercial \nand industrial air conditioning, heat pump and refrigeration systems. It is the HVAC industry’s standard of \ndetermining how much energy is required to create a single ton of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you\nreduce the unit cost of cooling you are saving energy regardless of how much overall cooling is required.\nThe chart to the right illustrates the average performance restoration the ECM created in the treated systems. \nThe average cost to operate these CRAC systems before it was treated with PermaFrost NMR® as calculated in \nkW/ton was 1.19.\nThe specific cost to operate after the systems were \ntreated with PermaFrost NMR® as calculated in \nkW/ton is currently .97.\nThe higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ \nwas expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss \nof performance efficiency for similar age and type \ncooling systems.\nkW/ton\n.22 kW/ton\nRecovered\nEnergy\nEquating to a\n18.5% Reduction\nCost Per Cooling Unit to Operate\nBaseline\nPost ECM\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\n1.19\n.97\n6\nThis report is provided to Caribbean Telecom Group.
