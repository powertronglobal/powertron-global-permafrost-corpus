HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report
Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study
The purpose of this jointly conducted ECM study between the Caribbean Telecom Provider and Powertron Global engineering teams 
was to further validate the first successful capacity study completed in Spring of 2015 on two 30-ton CRAC units 
with a follow-up (second) study. This second successful study focused on actual kWh savings (Caribbean Telecom Provider energy 
meter) and capacity improvements (IPMVP) on two more Liebert systems. 
The identiﬁcation of cooling systems involved in the study are recorded as follows:
•(2) 24-ton Emerson/Liebert CRAC, Mfg date: 2003, R-22, 408 volt-3 Phase, Model DH290A-GGEI
ECM Product Brief
PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented surface science nanotechnology that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative 
(NMR®) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost 
NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type of climate control system in which it is installed. The direct benefits 
of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling efficiency and increased capacity, both of which result in lower overall 
costs to operate a system and extended equipment life.

Methodology
After verifying the proper amount of air flowing across the evaporator coils of the two CRAC units before 
beginning the pilot, the subsequent measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and 
compiled in two ways. The first method was to install a Fluke power meter at the electrical panel in the same 
room as the CRAC units. The meter captured the power usage of both CRAC units as well as the condensing 
units associated with them. The second method was to measure the CRAC units in accordance with AHRI and 
Option B of the industry best practice International Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) 
framework. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor * 1.732/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
 
• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = (Measured CFM * 4.5 Enthalpy Delta T)/ 12,000 BTU 
Results from the Study
Using the two data collection methodologies outlined above, the key results from the pilot are as follows:
 
• Annual Energy use for the two CRAC units, as captured on the Caribbean Telecom Provider energy meter, fell 6.8% or 
 
   17,112 kWh’s
 
• Average Max Current (Amps) for the two CRAC units, as captured on the Caribbean Telecom Provider energy meter, fell 
 
   20.4% from 88.63 to 70.52
 
• Annual cost to operate the two CRAC units was reduced by $4,278, equating to a 12.6 month payback*
 
• Total capacity of the two pilot CRAC units increased by 19.4% from 28.8 tons to 34.4 tons
 
• kW/ton rating (i.e., the cost for every ton of cooling produced) was reduced by 18.5% from 1.19 to .97 
 
   kW/ton
*While $.16 cents was the targeted price in Dec 2015, the price of oil has more than doubled since that time

Summary of Power Meter Data
The Caribbean Telecom Provider power meter data (inside the red circles) taken from identical blocks of time and weather shows 
a 6.8% reduction in kWh’s, savings of $4,278 in US dollars annually, and an initial payback period of just 12.6 
months. The significance of these results not only show bottom line power savings but specifically 
demonstrates that when the workloads are nearly identical, the restored capacity provided by PermaFrost 
NMR® in these systems to near or at OEM design lower your cost per unit or kW/ton therefore Caribbean Telecom Provider is 
saving energy and money. This data serves to substantiate the IPMVP data taken in both pilots.

Recovered Wasted Energy with PermaFrost NMR (CRAC#1 & #2)
The “Unit Cost” in the HVAC industry is the kW/ton ratio. KW/ton is commonly used for larger commercial 
and industrial air conditioning, heat pump and refrigeration systems. It is the HVAC industry’s standard of 
determining how much energy is required to create a single ton of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you
reduce the unit cost of cooling you are saving energy regardless of how much overall cooling is required.
The chart to the right illustrates the average performance restoration the ECM created in the treated systems. 
The average cost to operate these CRAC systems before it was treated with PermaFrost NMR® as calculated in 
kW/ton was 1.19.
The specific cost to operate after the systems were 
treated with PermaFrost NMR® as calculated in 
kW/ton is currently .97.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ 
was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss 
of performance efficiency for similar age and type 
cooling systems.

Caribbean Telecom Provider is Saving More than Just Energy
By treating two more CRAC systems with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the current manner in which the 
Caribbean Telecom Provider operates the equipment, it will save approximately 17,112 kWh per year and all the costs associated 
with those savings. From an environmental impact standpoint, Caribbean Telecom Provider is also benefitting the surrounding 
community of [Jamaica Capital]. Imagine how great the environmental impact will be when Caribbean Telecom Provider moves forward 
with treating all their HVAC/R equipment in all their properties across their portfolio.
The 17,112 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 11.8 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from being 
released or any of the following:
