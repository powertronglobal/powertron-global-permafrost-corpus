Recovered Wasted Energy with PermaFrost NMR (CRAC#1 & #2)
The “Unit Cost” in the HVAC industry is the kW/ton ratio. KW/ton is commonly used for larger commercial 
and industrial air conditioning, heat pump and refrigeration systems. It is the HVAC industry’s standard of 
determining how much energy is required to create a single ton of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you
reduce the unit cost of cooling you are saving energy regardless of how much overall cooling is required.
The chart to the right illustrates the average performance restoration the ECM created in the treated systems. 
The average cost to operate these CRAC systems before it was treated with PermaFrost NMR® as calculated in 
kW/ton was 1.19.
The specific cost to operate after the systems were 
treated with PermaFrost NMR® as calculated in 
kW/ton is currently .97.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ 
was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss 
of performance efficiency for similar age and type 
cooling systems.
