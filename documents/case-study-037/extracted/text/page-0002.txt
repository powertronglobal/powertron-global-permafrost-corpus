HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report
Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study
The purpose of this jointly conducted ECM study between the Caribbean Telecom Provider and Powertron Global engineering teams 
was to further validate the first successful capacity study completed in Spring of 2015 on two 30-ton CRAC units 
with a follow-up (second) study. This second successful study focused on actual kWh savings (Caribbean Telecom Provider energy 
meter) and capacity improvements (IPMVP) on two more Liebert systems. 
The identiﬁcation of cooling systems involved in the study are recorded as follows:
•(2) 24-ton Emerson/Liebert CRAC, Mfg date: 2003, R-22, 408 volt-3 Phase, Model DH290A-GGEI
ECM Product Brief
PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented surface science nanotechnology that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative 
(NMR®) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost 
NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type of climate control system in which it is installed. The direct benefits 
of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling efficiency and increased capacity, both of which result in lower overall 
costs to operate a system and extended equipment life.
