Methodology
After verifying the proper amount of air flowing across the evaporator coils of the two CRAC units before 
beginning the pilot, the subsequent measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and 
compiled in two ways. The first method was to install a Fluke power meter at the electrical panel in the same 
room as the CRAC units. The meter captured the power usage of both CRAC units as well as the condensing 
units associated with them. The second method was to measure the CRAC units in accordance with AHRI and 
Option B of the industry best practice International Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) 
framework. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor * 1.732/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
 
• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = (Measured CFM * 4.5 Enthalpy Delta T)/ 12,000 BTU 
Results from the Study
Using the two data collection methodologies outlined above, the key results from the pilot are as follows:
 
• Annual Energy use for the two CRAC units, as captured on the Caribbean Telecom Provider energy meter, fell 6.8% or 
 
   17,112 kWh’s
 
• Average Max Current (Amps) for the two CRAC units, as captured on the Caribbean Telecom Provider energy meter, fell 
 
   20.4% from 88.63 to 70.52
 
• Annual cost to operate the two CRAC units was reduced by $4,278, equating to a 12.6 month payback*
 
• Total capacity of the two pilot CRAC units increased by 19.4% from 28.8 tons to 34.4 tons
 
• kW/ton rating (i.e., the cost for every ton of cooling produced) was reduced by 18.5% from 1.19 to .97 
 
   kW/ton
*While $.16 cents was the targeted price in Dec 2015, the price of oil has more than doubled since that time
