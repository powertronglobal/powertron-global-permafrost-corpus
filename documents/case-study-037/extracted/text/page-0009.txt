CRAC Unit #1 & #2 IPMVP Readings
The readings below were taken directly at the systems using recently NIST calibrated devices in accordance 
with AHRI and Option B of IPMVP protocols. Photographs of these key measurements are available on the 
next two pages. Special care was taken to record all measurements, baseline & post, during same outdoor 
air temperatures and when entering return air (dry bulb) were nearly identical.
