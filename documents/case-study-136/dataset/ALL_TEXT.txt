The testing included monitoring the operation before and after (PRE and POST) 
PermaFrost NMR® treatment to verify the amount of cooling capacity (tons) 
restoration and the resultant kW/ton energy savings improvement.  
The Measurement and Verification (M&V) protocol defined the boundary by 
isolating the entry and departure points of the medium being cooled to determine 
cooling performance and comparing that with the power being used to quantify 
the power costs per unit of cooling, kW/Ton (kilowatt-per-ton), EER (Energy 
Efficiency Ratio) and COP (Co-Efficient of Performance). 
1.
Method of Procedure for testing:
The objective of measuring the overall cooling production of HVAC/R systems 
can be realized by measuring the total energy consumed by the specific unit 
being tested and the total BTU production of the system then calculating these 
parameters to obtain current capacity, kW per ton, EER (energy efficient ratio) 
and COP (coefficient of performance). Using that information the total BTUH of 
cooling production can be realized. The objective of measuring overall power 
consumed by an HVAC/R system can be realized by measuring voltage, 
amperage and power factor.  
For these specific HVAC/R systems many parameters were measured every 
thirty milliseconds for a period of twelve (12) and nine (9) days for the 
development of a scientific baseline performance. Data was extracted from the 
parameters measured every five (5) seconds during all operating hours.  
Total BTUH was developed along with total kW consumption by measuring all 
required data points (35 points see appendix for points measured) and entering 
them into industry best practice engineering formulae. All measurement hardware 
was certified under NIST or CE standards. Engineering formulae was developed 
by AHRI / ASHRAE (American Heating and Refrigeration Institute / American

Society of Heating Refrigeration & Air Conditioning Engineers) 
 
The outdoor air temperature entering the air-cooled condenser coils of each unit 
will affect the design capacity. Therefore we have provided analysis of the twelve 
(12) day & nine (9) day periods to provide a performance profile of subsequent 
kW per ton, EER and COP across a variation of outdoor air temperatures 
consisting of a thirty (30) degree span (60ºF-90ºF) to demonstrate the current 
performance across the temperature span. 
 
The resultant data was extracted every five (5) seconds from the specific 
parameters measured throughout the entire day.  It was then applied to industry 
best practice engineering formulae developed by AHRI / ASHRAE (American 
Heating and Refrigeration Institute / American Society of Heating Refrigeration & 
Air Conditioning Engineers) for comparison: 
 
Kilo-watt (kW) = Volts (V) x Amps (A) x Power Factor (PF) x √3 / 1000 
British Thermal Units (BTU) = CFM x 4.5 x Enthalpy Delta  
Capacity / Tons = BTU / 12,000 
Kilo-watt per Ton (kW/Ton) = kW Energy / Tons (capacity) 
Co-Efficient of Performance (COP) = 12/kW per ton/ 3.412 
Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) = BTU / Watts 
 
During all twenty-four hours in a day, outdoor air temperature entering the air-
cooled condenser coils of each system varies significantly. Accordingly, pre or 
baseline and post analysis and comparison of improved capacity is across a thirty 
(30) degree temperature span (60ºF-90ºF) for kW per Ton, COP and EER. 
 
 
To Determine Capacity: 
 
The evaporator entering air volume and the return enthalpy are measured by the 
CFM and inlet enthalpy sensors. The evaporator leaving air enthalpy is measured 
by the outlet air enthalpy sensor. The inlet and outlet enthalpies are subtracted 
from each other resulting in a sum called the Enthalpy delta. This enthalpy delta 
(∆) is used in the shown formula below. Other components of this formula 
complete the equation. These include the volume of air passing through the 
evaporator (CFM or Cubic feet of air per minute) and an engineering standard ratio 
of 4.5 (Ratio of Standard Air) or constant.  The result of this calculation yields the 
industry standard the British Thermal Unit (BTU), which is used to calculate the 
unit’s capacity in BTU. This BTU number is then divided by the constant 12,000 
which is to convert to refrigeration tons because every 12,000 BTUs equals 1 Ton 
of HVAC capacity. The capacity formula is:

CFM x 4.5 x Enthalpy ∆ = BTUs / 12,000 = Tons (capacity) 
 
 
CFM – Cubic Feet per Minute of Air Flow or Air Volume 
4.5 – Ratio of Standard Air (constant) 
Enthalpy ∆ - Enthalpy Delta of the Inlet – Outlet Enthalpy 
BTU – British Thermal Units  
12,000 – every 12,000 BTUs equals 1 Ton (constant) 
 
Example 
 
4000 (CFM) X 4.5 (Standard Air Ratio) X 8 (Enthalpy Delta) = 144,000 BTU, then 
divide by 12,000 = 12 tons 
 
 
To Determine Electrical Energy Consumption: 
 
Total electrical consumption is measured at the main source of electric service of 
each rooftop unit. This includes, voltage, amperage and power factor and a 
constant of the square root of 3 (√3). This is then divided by 1000 to obtain 
kilowatts. The electrical formula for kilowatt (kW) is: 
 
kW = V x A x PF x √3 / 1000 
 
V – Voltage 
A – Amperage 
PF – Power Factor 
√3 – Square Root of 3 for 3-phase Input Power 
1000 – constant  
 
 
Example 
 
480 (volts) X 45 (amps) X √3 (phase angle for three phase power only) X 0.90 
(power factor) / 1000 = 33.67 kilowatts  
 
 
To Determine Efficiency: 
 
Divide the measured kilowatts (kW) by the measured tons to obtain kW per ton. 
kW per ton is the industry standard to determine system efficiency.  
 
Example 
 
33.67 kW / 12 tons = 2.80 kilowatts per ton

4.    Technical 
 
When PermaFrost NMR® is installed into a unit, a molecular transformation 
develops. This transformation displaces layers of lubricating fluids that have been 
impinged in the evaporator and condenser heat exchanger surfaces. When the 
fluid is displaced, the evaporator and condenser can transfer additional heat 
energy through the tube walls (thermal restoration). This enables the evaporator to 
completely dehumidify the air per the unit’s design specifications.  When more 
dehumidification is developed, the enthalpy (a measure of how many grains of 
moisture are contained in a pound of air) increases. 
 
If the CFM and 4.5 remain constant, then it is the effect of PermaFrost NMR®’s 
Enthalpy Delta increase that restores (increases) the lost capacity (Tons).  
 
If the tonnage increases, then the kW/ton decreases by means of mathematical 
function, demonstrating PermaFrost NMR®’s post-treatment effect lowering the 
electrical cost of every ton of cooling produced, no matter how many tons are 
called for at any given time.  
  
PermaFrost NMR® cannot change any unit’s electrical characteristics i.e. 
everything that requires electricity is rated for the required power under different 
loads e.g. compressors and fans.  
 
 
 
 
5.    Conclusion 
 
The Maicom testing results validate the performance of the three (3) HVAC/R 
systems is consistent with a previously tested UL (formerly Underwriters 
Laboratories) unit as well as +300 case studies for review.  The results of the 
testing demonstrate the efficacy of PermaFrost NMR® by restoring the evaporator 
and condenser heat transfer capabilities per manufacturer’s design, thereby 
increasing cooling capacity while lowering the electrical cost per ton of cooling.
