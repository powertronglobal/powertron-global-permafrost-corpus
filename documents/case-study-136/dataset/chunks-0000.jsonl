Technical \n \nWhen PermaFrost NMR\u00ae is installed into a unit, a molecular transformation \ndevelops. This transformation displaces layers of lubricating fluids that have been \nimpinged in the evaporator and condenser heat exchanger surfaces. When the \nfluid is displaced, the evaporator and condenser can transfer additional heat \nenergy through the tube walls (thermal restoration). This enables the evaporator to \ncompletely dehumidify the air per the unit\u2019s design specifications.  When more \ndehumidification is developed, the enthalpy (a measure of how many grains of \nmoisture are contained in a pound of air) increases. \n \nIf the CFM and 4.5 remain constant, then it is the effect of PermaFrost NMR\u00ae\u2019s \nEnthalpy Delta increase that restores (increases) the lost capacity (Tons).  \n \nIf the tonnage increases, then the kW/ton decreases by means of mathematical \nfunction, demonstrating PermaFrost NMR\u00ae\u2019s post-treatment effect lowering the \nelectrical cost of every ton of cooling produced, no matter how many tons are \ncalled for at any given time.  \n  \nPermaFrost NMR\u00ae cannot change any unit\u2019s electrical characteristics i.e. \neverything that requires electricity is rated for the required power under different \nloads e.g. compressors and fans.  \n \n \n \n \n5.    Conclusion \n \nThe Maicom testing results validate the performance of the three (3) HVAC/R \nsystems is consistent with a previously tested UL (formerly Underwriters \nLaboratories) unit as well as +300 case studies for review.  The results of the \ntesting demonstrate the efficacy of PermaFrost NMR\u00ae by restoring the evaporator \nand condenser heat transfer capabilities per manufacturer\u2019s design, thereby \nincreasing cooling capacity while lowering the electrical cost per ton of cooling.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\u2550\u2550\u2550 PAGE 007 \u2550\u2550\u2550\n \nThis document is proprietary and confidential to Powertron Global, LLC and is not to be modified, distributed all or in part to any third party \nwithout prior written approval. \u00a9 Copyright 2017 Powertron Global, LLC. \n \nF. \nAPPENDIX \n \nI. \nCU-1 Performance Analysis Summary \nII. \nCU-2 Performance Analysis Summary \nIII. \nPKG-1 Performance Analysis Summary \nIV. \n35 Points Measured  \n \n*(all raw data files are available and will be provided) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\u2550\u2550\u2550 PAGE 008 \u2550\u2550\u2550\n \nThis document is proprietary and confidential to Powertron Global, LLC and is not to be modified, distributed all or in part to any third party \nwithout prior written approval. \u00a9 Copyright 2017 Powertron Global, LLC. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \nAPPENDIX I \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "tokens": 1125, "chars": 4426, "content_hash": "13f69e96942f", "prev_id": "case-study-136_chunk_0004", "next_id": "case-study-136_chunk_0006"}
