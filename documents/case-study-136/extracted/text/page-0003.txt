The testing included monitoring the operation before and after (PRE and POST) 
PermaFrost NMR® treatment to verify the amount of cooling capacity (tons) 
restoration and the resultant kW/ton energy savings improvement.  
The Measurement and Verification (M&V) protocol defined the boundary by 
isolating the entry and departure points of the medium being cooled to determine 
cooling performance and comparing that with the power being used to quantify 
the power costs per unit of cooling, kW/Ton (kilowatt-per-ton), EER (Energy 
Efficiency Ratio) and COP (Co-Efficient of Performance).

Method of Procedure for testing:
The objective of measuring the overall cooling production of HVAC/R systems 
can be realized by measuring the total energy consumed by the specific unit 
being tested and the total BTU production of the system then calculating these 
parameters to obtain current capacity, kW per ton, EER (energy efficient ratio) 
and COP (coefficient of performance). Using that information the total BTUH of 
cooling production can be realized. The objective of measuring overall power 
consumed by an HVAC/R system can be realized by measuring voltage, 
amperage and power factor.  
For these specific HVAC/R systems many parameters were measured every 
thirty milliseconds for a period of twelve (12) and nine (9) days for the 
development of a scientific baseline performance. Data was extracted from the 
parameters measured every five (5) seconds during all operating hours.  
Total BTUH was developed along with total kW consumption by measuring all 
required data points (35 points see appendix for points measured) and entering 
them into industry best practice engineering formulae. All measurement hardware 
was certified under NIST or CE standards. Engineering formulae was developed 
by AHRI / ASHRAE (American Heating and Refrigeration Institute / American
