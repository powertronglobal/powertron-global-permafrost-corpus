The test refrigeration equipment was pulled right off the Major Appliance Manufacturer assembly line. The thermal improvement 
testing was conducted on the following refrigerator/freezer: 
 
 
 
Side-by-Side 
Make 
Frigidaire 
Model 
FGUS2647LF3 
Serial Number 
4A23320453 
Refrigerant Type 
R410A 
Nominal Cooling Capacity in 
BTUs   
900 BTUs 
Date ECM Installed 
30 June 2013 
 
 
 
   
 
 
The images show how the Side-by-Side unit was wired up inside 
the Major Appliance Manufacturer chamber with NIST-calibrated and certified digital 
instrumentation. The devices calculate the thermal improvement 
efficiency of the unit by measuring the temperature of the 
refrigerant entering the evaporator, the temperature of the 
refrigerant leaving the evaporator (showing amount of heat 
removed), and the leaving air stream temperature within the 
cabinet to achieve the set points shown in the image directly 
above.
