 
 
The improvement in thermal efficiency in the Side-by-Side refrigeration unit is solely attributable to the 
PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  Heat transfer improvement is a result of the successful removal of accumulated 
lubricant boundary layer on heat exchange surfaces and because metal treated with PermaFrost NMR® moves 
heat through the tube walls more efficiently by creating a nano-molecular heat sink .    
 
 
Baseline	  &	  Post	  Measurements	  	  
	  
The identical data points were recorded inside the unit for Baseline and Post on 6/30/13 and 7/7/13 
respectively using recently NIST-calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. In all tests the external 
variables to the Side-by-Side unit were controlled within the chamber so the thermal improvements shown are 
all attributable to the ECM.  The measurements are as follows:
