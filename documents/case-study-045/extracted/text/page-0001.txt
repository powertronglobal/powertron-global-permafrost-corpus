This report contains specific information regarding the thermal transfer enhancement ability of the energy 
conservation measure (ECM) PermaFrost NMR® manufactured by Powertron Global, LLC. 
(www.powertronglobal.com) in a new Frigidaire Side-by-Side refrigerator/freezer unit.  The testing was 
conducted in the environmentally controlled Major Appliance Manufacturer measurement & verification (M&V) chambers located in 
Anderson, South Carolina.  All testing was conducted under the guidance of Mr. [Compressor Test Engineer], following the 
industry standard Energy Star guidelines for determining energy efficiency utilizing the AHAM HRF-1-2008 (*) 
standard. The brand new unit was operated non-stop during a one-week burn-in period prior to the baseline 
readings being taking over a 24-hour period. The ECM was then introduced in the proper dosage directly in 
front of the expansion device and allowed to work for an additional week before post readings were taken. 
Details of the testing are presented later in this report. 
 
The purpose of the testing was two fold:   
1) Demonstrate how the ECM improves the thermal performance in new equipment. 
2) Demonstrate that the ECM is safe for installation in new or existing refrigeration equipment.
