Following treatment with the ECM, the three successive cooling cycles measured immediately following a 
defrost cycle showed an average Delta T of 5.8 degrees between the entering evaporator and leaving 
evaporator refrigerant temperatures. This increase of 1.83 degrees F over the baseline average of 3.93 
degrees represents an increase of 47.6%. This is considered very significant.

In achieving the Delta T improvement, the ECM produced a colder entering evaporator temperature. Prior to 
treatment, the coldest average entering evaporator temperature was -20.06 degrees F. Following treatment, 
the coldest average evaporator temperature dropped to -21 degrees F. This .96 degree drop equates to a 
4.7% improvement. This is considered significant.

Corresponding to the colder entering evaporator temperature, the ECM also generated a warmer leaving 
evaporator temperature. Prior to treatment, the warmest average evaporator temperature was -16.13 degrees 
F. Following treatment, the warmest average leaving evaporator temperature rose to -15.2. This .93 degree 
rise equates to a 5.8% improvement. This again is considered significant.
