Examples include refrigerant leaks, dirty coils \n(outside), fan and compressor issues.\nWhen the system is in proper working order proceed with the Recommendations & Requirements of PermaFrost NMR®.\nBefore you begin the installation of PermaFrost NMR®\nThe two types of PermaFrost NMR® formulas for DX units are synthetic and mineral. \nIt is important that the correct PermaFrost NMR® formulation is matched to the \ncorrect  refrigerant oil type. The oil type always determines the correct type of \nPermaFrost NMR® to be installed. On occasion, larger DX units may be equipped \nwith refrigerants such as R-22 (mineral based), but have a synthetic refrigeration oil; \nnever assume the oil type, this must be veriﬁed.\nWe require a separate pump/injector for any units equipped with mineral based \nrefrigerant oils and a separate pump/injector for any units equipped with synthetic \nbased refrigerant oils.  This is to reduce the risk of cross contamination. \nRECOMMENDATIONS & REQUIREMENTS\n#77950\n#77930\n\n\n\nThe installer must know how much their pump injects per stroke. For example, the Yellow Jacket Max-Flow #77930\nthat is recommended pumps 3.8 oz. per stroke (simply approximate 4 oz.). If you use an injector or some other piece of \nequipment, follow recommend OEM guidelines for adding oil to HVAC equipment.\nAll PermaFrost NMR® injections are measured in U.S. ﬂuid oz. The amount of PermaFrost NMR® to be installed is \ndirectly proportional to the total tonnage of the unit. This is further explained (Step 6) in the Instructions For Installing. \nIt is recommended that the compressor remains operational during the entire installation process. This will ensure \nthat PermaFrost NMR® is thoroughly circulated throughout the system.\nInsure that all precautions are taken to assure that there are no residual \nproducts such as old oil or any foreign matter present in the charging apparatus.\nCare should be taken to assure the purity of the PermaFrost NMR®. \n2\n1\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLING\nPermaFrost NMR®\nUse the same precautions handling PermaFrost NMR®, as you would while handling refrigerant oils.\n      Approach unit and identify nominal tonnage and refrigerant oil type to determine how much (Step 6) and what \ntype of PermaFrost NMR® to install.\n      Locate low pressure port or suction side of the unit and remove cap.\n      Place recommended oil pump into the PermaFrost NMR® container but be sure that oil pump does not have any\nresidual refrigerant oil or contaminates on the copper tube before submerging into the PermaFrost NMR® container.\n      Next, purge the charging hose of air. Place the end of the hose over the opening of the PermaFrost NMR® container to \ncapture excess. Do not inject any non-condensable into refrigeration circuit!\n      Connect charging hose to suction port on the unit.\n      All injections of PermaFrost NMR® will be measured in US fluid ounces (or metric equivalent). The treat level is 1 oz. \nof PermaFrost NMR® per 1 ton of refrigeration.", "tokens": 808, "chars": 3451, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "dataroom_010_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:32bf08445cdfbe5d49db2940b2e3062046d6b9dd14cc4fd39491c12f5cb22c2c"}

Do not inject any non-condensable into refrigeration circuit!\n      Connect charging hose to suction port on the unit.\n      All injections of PermaFrost NMR® will be measured in US fluid ounces (or metric equivalent). The treat level is 1 oz. \nof PermaFrost NMR® per 1 ton of refrigeration. For example: for a 5 ton unit, add 5 ounces of PermaFrost NMR®. If \nthere is a ½ ton increment, round up to the next full ounce. However, if the unit has multiple circuits it is important to \ndetermine the total capacity per circuit. Inject the required amount of PermaFrost NMR® per each circuit's total\ntonnage. PermaFrost NMR® injections are safe within 5% of the actual tonnage so there is margin for error when \ninstalling the product. Approximate and use your best judgment.\n      Once the proper dosage is injected into the system, remove the charging hose and wipe away excess.\n      Once all of the units have been installed at a given location, remove pump from PermaFrost NMR® container, \nletting excess drip back into the container to reduce waste.\n\n\n\nPOST INSTALLATION GUIDELINES\nPermaFrost NMR® will remove any oil ﬁlm inside the heat exchangers, and on some older systems the stagnant oil \nmay clog the ﬁlter drier.  This is evidence that PermaFrost NMR® is working properly.  Filter drier replacement only \noccurs in ~3% of all DX systems treated. PermaFrost NMR® does not directly cause the clogging of the ﬁlter drier \nhowever the amount and size of the performance robbing contaminates dislodged by the product can.\nThis completes the PermaFrost NMR® installation process.\nPowertron Global LLC. © Copyright 2017\nTROUBLESHOOTING\nInstalling PermaFrost NMR® in a unit that is low on \nrefrigerant may freeze the evaporator. If this happens \nthe solution is to simply charge the unit properly.\nThe system will return to normal when the\nrefrigerant level is correct.\nFor Assistance Please Call info@powertronglobal.com\nor email support@powertronglobal.com \n15402 Dexler Drive\nAustin, TX 78734\nwww.powertronglobal.com", "tokens": 523, "chars": 2065, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_010_chunk_0001", "next_id": "", "content_hash": "sha256:fd0a28be487072f6f516d0c63878e435079d852fd7c660045dffd58cafc9887a"}
