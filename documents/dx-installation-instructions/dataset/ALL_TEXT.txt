PermaFrost NMR®
 Installation Instructions
for DX
The following instructions are designed to
guide licensed HVAC personnel through the
PermaFrost NMR® installation process for
DX style equipment. 
Normal routine maintenance and services are required to ensure ﬂawless installation and bottom line results.
Inspect the HVAC equipment  and ensure that it is in proper working order.
Complete any necessary repairs prior to PermaFrost NMR® installation. Examples include refrigerant leaks, dirty coils 
(outside), fan and compressor issues.
When the system is in proper working order proceed with the Recommendations & Requirements of PermaFrost NMR®.
Before you begin the installation of PermaFrost NMR®
The two types of PermaFrost NMR® formulas for DX units are synthetic and mineral. 
It is important that the correct PermaFrost NMR® formulation is matched to the 
correct  refrigerant oil type. The oil type always determines the correct type of 
PermaFrost NMR® to be installed. On occasion, larger DX units may be equipped 
with refrigerants such as R-22 (mineral based), but have a synthetic refrigeration oil; 
never assume the oil type, this must be veriﬁed.
We require a separate pump/injector for any units equipped with mineral based 
refrigerant oils and a separate pump/injector for any units equipped with synthetic 
based refrigerant oils.  This is to reduce the risk of cross contamination.

The installer must know how much their pump injects per stroke. For example, the Yellow Jacket Max-Flow #77930
that is recommended pumps 3.8 oz. per stroke (simply approximate 4 oz.). If you use an injector or some other piece of 
equipment, follow recommend OEM guidelines for adding oil to HVAC equipment.
All PermaFrost NMR® injections are measured in U.S. ﬂuid oz. The amount of PermaFrost NMR® to be installed is 
directly proportional to the total tonnage of the unit. This is further explained (Step 6) in the Instructions For Installing. 
It is recommended that the compressor remains operational during the entire installation process. This will ensure 
that PermaFrost NMR® is thoroughly circulated throughout the system.
Insure that all precautions are taken to assure that there are no residual 
products such as old oil or any foreign matter present in the charging apparatus.
Care should be taken to assure the purity of the PermaFrost NMR®.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLING
PermaFrost NMR®
Use the same precautions handling PermaFrost NMR®, as you would while handling refrigerant oils.
      Approach unit and identify nominal tonnage and refrigerant oil type to determine how much (Step 6) and what 
type of PermaFrost NMR® to install.
      Locate low pressure port or suction side of the unit and remove cap.
      Place recommended oil pump into the PermaFrost NMR® container but be sure that oil pump does not have any
residual refrigerant oil or contaminates on the copper tube before submerging into the PermaFrost NMR® container.
      Next, purge the charging hose of air. Place the end of the hose over the opening of the PermaFrost NMR® container to 
capture excess. Do not inject any non-condensable into refrigeration circuit!
      Connect charging hose to suction port on the unit.
      All injections of PermaFrost NMR® will be measured in US fluid ounces (or metric equivalent). The treat level is 1 oz. 
of PermaFrost NMR® per 1 ton of refrigeration. For example: for a 5 ton unit, add 5 ounces of PermaFrost NMR®. If 
there is a ½ ton increment, round up to the next full ounce. However, if the unit has multiple circuits it is important to 
determine the total capacity per circuit. Inject the required amount of PermaFrost NMR® per each circuit's total
tonnage. PermaFrost NMR® injections are safe within 5% of the actual tonnage so there is margin for error when 
installing the product. Approximate and use your best judgment.
      Once the proper dosage is injected into the system, remove the charging hose and wipe away excess.
      Once all of the units have been installed at a given location, remove pump from PermaFrost NMR® container, 
letting excess drip back into the container to reduce waste.

POST INSTALLATION GUIDELINES
PermaFrost NMR® will remove any oil ﬁlm inside the heat exchangers, and on some older systems the stagnant oil 
may clog the ﬁlter drier.  This is evidence that PermaFrost NMR® is working properly.  Filter drier replacement only 
occurs in ~3% of all DX systems treated. PermaFrost NMR® does not directly cause the clogging of the ﬁlter drier 
however the amount and size of the performance robbing contaminates dislodged by the product can.
This completes the PermaFrost NMR® installation process.

TROUBLESHOOTING
Installing PermaFrost NMR® in a unit that is low on 
refrigerant may freeze the evaporator. If this happens 
the solution is to simply charge the unit properly.
The system will return to normal when the
refrigerant level is correct.
