POST INSTALLATION GUIDELINES
PermaFrost NMR® will remove any oil ﬁlm inside the heat exchangers, and on some older systems the stagnant oil 
may clog the ﬁlter drier.  This is evidence that PermaFrost NMR® is working properly.  Filter drier replacement only 
occurs in ~3% of all DX systems treated. PermaFrost NMR® does not directly cause the clogging of the ﬁlter drier 
however the amount and size of the performance robbing contaminates dislodged by the product can.
This completes the PermaFrost NMR® installation process.

TROUBLESHOOTING
Installing PermaFrost NMR® in a unit that is low on 
refrigerant may freeze the evaporator. If this happens 
the solution is to simply charge the unit properly.
The system will return to normal when the
refrigerant level is correct.
