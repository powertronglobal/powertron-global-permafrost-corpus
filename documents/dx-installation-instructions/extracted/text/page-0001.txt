PermaFrost NMR®
 Installation Instructions
for DX
The following instructions are designed to
guide licensed HVAC personnel through the
PermaFrost NMR® installation process for
DX style equipment. 
Normal routine maintenance and services are required to ensure ﬂawless installation and bottom line results.
Inspect the HVAC equipment  and ensure that it is in proper working order.
Complete any necessary repairs prior to PermaFrost NMR® installation. Examples include refrigerant leaks, dirty coils 
(outside), fan and compressor issues.
When the system is in proper working order proceed with the Recommendations & Requirements of PermaFrost NMR®.
Before you begin the installation of PermaFrost NMR®
The two types of PermaFrost NMR® formulas for DX units are synthetic and mineral. 
It is important that the correct PermaFrost NMR® formulation is matched to the 
correct  refrigerant oil type. The oil type always determines the correct type of 
PermaFrost NMR® to be installed. On occasion, larger DX units may be equipped 
with refrigerants such as R-22 (mineral based), but have a synthetic refrigeration oil; 
never assume the oil type, this must be veriﬁed.
We require a separate pump/injector for any units equipped with mineral based 
refrigerant oils and a separate pump/injector for any units equipped with synthetic 
based refrigerant oils.  This is to reduce the risk of cross contamination.
