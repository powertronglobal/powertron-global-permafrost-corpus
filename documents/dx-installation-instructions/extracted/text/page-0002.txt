The installer must know how much their pump injects per stroke. For example, the Yellow Jacket Max-Flow #77930
that is recommended pumps 3.8 oz. per stroke (simply approximate 4 oz.). If you use an injector or some other piece of 
equipment, follow recommend OEM guidelines for adding oil to HVAC equipment.
All PermaFrost NMR® injections are measured in U.S. ﬂuid oz. The amount of PermaFrost NMR® to be installed is 
directly proportional to the total tonnage of the unit. This is further explained (Step 6) in the Instructions For Installing. 
It is recommended that the compressor remains operational during the entire installation process. This will ensure 
that PermaFrost NMR® is thoroughly circulated throughout the system.
Insure that all precautions are taken to assure that there are no residual 
products such as old oil or any foreign matter present in the charging apparatus.
Care should be taken to assure the purity of the PermaFrost NMR®.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLING
PermaFrost NMR®
Use the same precautions handling PermaFrost NMR®, as you would while handling refrigerant oils.
      Approach unit and identify nominal tonnage and refrigerant oil type to determine how much (Step 6) and what 
type of PermaFrost NMR® to install.
      Locate low pressure port or suction side of the unit and remove cap.
      Place recommended oil pump into the PermaFrost NMR® container but be sure that oil pump does not have any
residual refrigerant oil or contaminates on the copper tube before submerging into the PermaFrost NMR® container.
      Next, purge the charging hose of air. Place the end of the hose over the opening of the PermaFrost NMR® container to 
capture excess. Do not inject any non-condensable into refrigeration circuit!
      Connect charging hose to suction port on the unit.
      All injections of PermaFrost NMR® will be measured in US fluid ounces (or metric equivalent). The treat level is 1 oz. 
of PermaFrost NMR® per 1 ton of refrigeration. For example: for a 5 ton unit, add 5 ounces of PermaFrost NMR®. If 
there is a ½ ton increment, round up to the next full ounce. However, if the unit has multiple circuits it is important to 
determine the total capacity per circuit. Inject the required amount of PermaFrost NMR® per each circuit's total
tonnage. PermaFrost NMR® injections are safe within 5% of the actual tonnage so there is margin for error when 
installing the product. Approximate and use your best judgment.
      Once the proper dosage is injected into the system, remove the charging hose and wipe away excess.
      Once all of the units have been installed at a given location, remove pump from PermaFrost NMR® container, 
letting excess drip back into the container to reduce waste.
