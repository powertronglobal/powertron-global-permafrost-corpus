The dependence on foreign oil \nand the need to improve efficiency have been national goals for nearly 40 years.  The \ndevelopment of additional power generating facilities however has been slow, compared to \nenergy demand control.  This is in part because current public service commission rules make \nrecovery of costs for large-scale power projects difficult and smaller increments of green power \nare just emerging as cost effective alternatives.   \n       \nAt the same time, the energy sector struggles with improving the efficiency of mechanical parts \nin its efforts to increase power production or decrease power use.  For example, much of the \npotential energy in fossil fuels and coal is lost to heat, making these processes less than 40% \nefficient, which is far better than the 15% efficiency for a car engine, but is still a significant loss \nof potential energy.  Incremental improvements in efficiency at either the customer or power \ngeneration point yield significant benefits across the grid, especially in peak times. \n \nBecause siting and constructing power plants is an arduous and expensive process, many power \ncompanies have attempted to extend the life of their current power generating facilities by \noffering rebates to customers for energy saving measures like insulation, more efficient \nappliances and HVAC system renovations.  HVAC systems are often the largest users of power \nfor homes and businesses, especially in the State of Florida and the rest of the southern United \nStates where humidity is a concurrent issue. HVAC may consume 60-80 percent of the power \nused in homes and businesses.  Since HVAC efficiency tends to decrease linearly with time due \nto oil fouling in their heat exchangers. The ability to improve HVAC performance, or to extend \nthe life of HVAC system efficiency, would be of benefit both to customers and power generating \nentities. For the customer, the benefits include the potential for reduced maintenance and shorter \nrecovery times for their investments. For power suppliers, the benefits include the delay of the \nnext increment of power supply.  From a power industry perspective, the more efficient the \nHVAC system,  the more available power there is on the grid for new customers, the lower the \ncarbon emissions and the more palatable the options is as a green solution.  \n \nMost mechanisms to improve efficiency of HVAC system are mechanical – if the parts work \nmore efficiently, the power draw will be less and the ability to perform additional work will be \ndisplayed as increased capacity (Btuh).  Among the issues in the compressor is the heat buildup \nfrom mechanical friction.  The mechanical friction will cause a heat loss, which then manifests \nitself as a reduction in efficiency of the unit.  Friction also increases wear on the unit, which \nfurther reduces the efficiency of the units over time.  If the friction can be reduced, efficiency \nshould improve and the life of the equipment should increase.  Demonstrating a means to reduce \nfriction is difficult.   \n \nWithin most conventional HVAC systems there is lubricating oil. The primary use of the oil is to \nlubricate the compressor.

Demonstrating a means to reduce \nfriction is difficult.   \n \nWithin most conventional HVAC systems there is lubricating oil. The primary use of the oil is to \nlubricate the compressor. As the compressor pushes the refrigerant out, the small amount of oil \nthat is there to lubricate will get pushed out with the refrigerant.  Over time the oil is going build \nlayer upon layer in the refrigerant lines, just as it does in your car’s engine where oil escapes the \ncompression stroke and is combusted.  In HVAC over time the compressor oil is going to escape \nthe compressor and coat the heat exchangers. Oil is an insulator and therefore will impede the\n\n\n\n3\nheat exchange. When a system is new it is operating at its highest efficiency.  As years go by and \nrun time of the system is accumulated, that same initial efficiency is decreased. This decrease is a \ndirect result of the oil coating all of the heat exchange surfaces, resulting in longer run times. \n \nThe refrigerant lines within the heat exchangers and that connect split systems are metal and \ntherefore have a positive charge, while the oil and refrigerant have a negative charge. The oil will \nstick to the refrigerant wall lines and as it breaks down, more will stick, ultimately building up a \nlayer of degraded oil on the surface. If there were a compound that could remove the insulating \noil from these heat exchanger surfaces and improve the ability of the heat exchangers to develop \na more efficient transfer of energy, the result would be restored BTUH capacity and reduced total \nkWh. \n \nPermaFrost NMR®, covered by US patent numbers 6369006, 6362139, 6286323, and 6276147, \nis purported to be such a product.  The concept behind PermaFrost NMR® is that it has a higher \nnegative charge than either the refrigerant or refrigerant oil used by manufacturers in their \nsystems. When installed, PermaFrost NMR® penetrates and binds to the metal lattice in the \nrefrigerant lines and heat exchange surfaces. Subsequently this action removes the fouled oil, \nwhich will return back into circulation and ultimately to the compressor oil reservoir where it \nshould be. As the PermaFrost NMR® displaces the trapped oil it will restore the ability of the \nheat exchanger to transfer heat energy back to near design specifications. With the restored \nability of the heat exchanger, the system will be able to produce colder air therefore satisfy the \nthermostat in the conditioned space sooner enabling the unit to run less to perform the same \nwork. This is where most of the savings are achieved. \n \nThere are several questions about this technology that require answers.  The first question is \nwhether there is anything in PermaFrost NMR® that would reduce the refrigerant lubricating oil \nsurface bonding, to allow it (the refrigeration oil) to be displaced by the PermaFrost NMR®?  A \npolar molecule would have a higher attraction to the metal and displace the lower charged oil \nmolecules. This would mean the system efficiency would improve after PermaFrost NMR™ is \nadded.  If there is no surface bonding or displacement of refrigerant oil, then no improvement \nshould be seen in the short term. \n \nThe second question is whether the PermaFrost NMR® can adversely impact the refrigerant \nflow?  If PermaFrost NMR® does work at the micro level and can replace the trapped \nrefrigerant oil, reduce laminar friction and return refrigerant oil from the heat exchangers, it \nwould only improve the flow.", "tokens": 785, "chars": 3522, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0001", "next_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:3b32e83a3cf5e1d95667a1b649833d1a9ca9e4175226631e552ba350d7222b31"}

If PermaFrost NMR® does work at the micro level and can replace the trapped \nrefrigerant oil, reduce laminar friction and return refrigerant oil from the heat exchangers, it \nwould only improve the flow.  If it does not accomplish the above, it would only add to the \nvolume of oil in the heat exchangers and possibly reduce refrigerant flow.   \n \nAn accompanying question about product longevity inside a system have been asked, including \none of the large utilities that currently provides rebates for PermaFrost NMR®.   An oil analysis \nstamped by a PE shows all of the tests required to satisfactorily provide an answer.  While the \nchemical specifics of these three questions is technically beyond the scope of this review, they \nplay into the results included in this reports.  To address these three questions, a lab test showing \nlong-term compatibility with metals, groups of refrigerants, and common by products of \nrefrigeration, as well as thermo conductivity and friction tests is attached. (Appendix A). The \nconclusion from this review was:\n\n\n\n4\n“PermaFrost NMR® will continue to work at the surface as long as there is \nnothing changing internally in a system to deactivate the product. The tests in the \noil analysis prove that PermaFrost NMR® will not separate under all applicable \ntolerances and will remain active under standard operating conditions.  In addition \nto the actual bonding, chemically the molecular weight of PermaFrost NMR® is \nheavier than oil and water and will not be lifted away due to floating or \ndisplacement by refrigerant oil, liquid refrigerant or any other lighter fluid.  (As \nan example, in a bowl of water, refrigerant oil will float and PermaFrost NMR® \nwill sink to the bottom proving it is heavier than both water and oil.)  The \ncombination of surface bonding and molecular weight keep PermaFrost NMR® \non the metal surfaces preventing the refrigerant oil from reversing the effect.   \nAny solution must create a bond to the surface and space lattice and remain in \nplace or the product will work itself out of the heat exchangers and the benefits \nwill fade quickly.” \n \nThe fourth question, and focus of this report, is whether the efficiency can be demonstrated \nunder a series of conditions, both in-situ and controlled.  There are protocols for determining \nsavings, but from a power supply perspective, less draw on the grid (kW) is desirable.  One \nproblem with any technology such as this is that there have been several predecessor products \nthat claimed to provide such benefits. The older studies of several additives all showed no \nsignificant savings, which is one reason why power providers may be reluctant to pursue these \ntypes of technological options.  \n \n A different research result could open the door to stating that some refrigerant-based surface \nscience technologies can produce results that save energy.  Hence, demonstrating the savings in-\nsitu and in a controlled environment is beneficial.  There is long term data for demonstrating \nperformance advantages, but the variables cannot be controlled for these sites.  However, \nbecause of the chemical nature of the product, if it works in the short term it should also work in \nthe long term.  The properties appear to make it less likely to deteriorate than the oil in the \ncompressors that may last up to 15-20 years in some sealed systems.

The International Performance \nMeasurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) is the widely referenced framework for \n“measuring” energy savings at each site.   IPMVP presents common terminology and defines full \ndisclosure, to support rational discussion of measurement and verification issues. A primary \npurpose of IPMVP is to publish current good measurement and verification practice, as \nreassurance for the public about savings reports. Performance contracting industry growth in the \nUSA was facilitated by the publication of the IPMVP. \n \nThe Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and \nAir-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) \nrecognize the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy \nconservation methods and products. There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for \nenergy conservation professionals to utilize: options A, B, C and D.\n\n\n\n5\nRetrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is defined as: All \nparameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single \nsource of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the \nECM (energy conservation method) affected equipment or system and any performance \nenhancements versus the baseline data. Measurement frequency ranges from short term to \ncontinuous, depending on the expected variations in the savings and the length of the reporting \nperiod. For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term measurements are useful as data when \nthe variables are controlled. The savings are calculated by short-term measurements of baseline \nand reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using measurements of proxies of \nenergy use. \n \nThe testing procedure used here utilizes the \"Option B\" of that protocol.  Powertron Global's use \nof this protocol under the direct application by a measurement and verification professional \nutilizes enthalpy performance verification to develop a confidence baseline. After the baseline \nhas been developed the installation of PermaFrost NMR® was completed as a single ECM.  \n \nWhat to Measure?  \n  \nPractical standards exist that relate to efficiency and delivery of HVAC systems performance.  \nListed below are the important considerations: \n \nBtu: Btu equals the amount of heat it takes to change the temperature of one pound of water one \ndegree Fahrenheit.  The HVAC system is supposed to remove Btus from a building (or put them \ninto a building). Each room needs just the right amount in and out, or it’s not comfortable.  A \nmore efficient system can provide more Btuh of capacity than a less efficient one.  The goal \nwould be to determine if the refrigerant allows the unit to increase Btuh output, which means that \ntotal operating or run time will decrease accordingly, thereby decreasing total kW hours \nconsumed.  \n \nTons:  One ton of nominal cooling equals 12,000 Btu, although this factor should be termed \n“nominal” because no one makes equipment that delivers 12,000.  Under ideal conditions, most \ncooling equipment delivers around 11,700 Btu per ton.   From an efficiency perspective, more \nBtus produced per ton of HVAC system is viewed positively.", "tokens": 789, "chars": 3839, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0003", "next_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0005", "content_hash": "sha256:a790fbb257d05a8f76f1a484442a0869a21bdf70dba4f5e7c6873fa221a7ea60"}

Under ideal conditions, most \ncooling equipment delivers around 11,700 Btu per ton.   From an efficiency perspective, more \nBtus produced per ton of HVAC system is viewed positively. \n \nMeasuring enthalpy to calculate efficiency:  The amount of heat in air is referred to as \nenthalpy. In the US, the enthalpy of air (in the HVAC business) is measured in BTUs per pound \nof air. The enthalpy is directly related to the wet bulb temperature.  Air comprises gasses and \nwater / moisture. The gases are mostly nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%). The amount of water / \nmoisture in the air is expressed as a relative humidity with typical values of comfort for people \nbetween 20% and 65%. When heating or cooling air, both the gases (which is called sensible \nheat) and water vapor (which is called latent heat) are affected. A large amount of energy is \nrequired to heat or cool the water in the air. It is therefore important to know both temperature \nand relative humidity to calculate how much heating or cooling is taking place. It is especially \nimportant to show a change or improvement to a heating or cooling system. \n \nThe enthalpy value yields the amount of heat in a pound of air. To know the total heat removed \nby the evaporator, the rate of flow of air in cubic feet per minute that passes through the \nevaporator. This measurement of heat removal by the air conditioning system is independent of\n\n\n\n6\nthe ambient temperature outside the building and also independent of the actual temperatures of \nthe room itself. \n \nAirflow:  Airflow is required to circulate the Btu’s around. Most equipment requires 400 cu.ft. \nof air through the system in a minute in cooling mode, plus or minus 10%, or 360 to 440 CFM \nper ton of cooling. Below 360 CFM/Ton, the heat transfer through the coil reduces rapidly. The \nairflow through the system is all that really counts. It should match the airflow over the coil, \nminus a few CFM for duct airflow loss, which is an unfortunate reality to some degree in nearly \nevery system.  Airflow over the indoor coil should be verified and never ignored. \n \nStatic Pressure:  Nearly every installation instruction requires the measurement of total external \nstatic pressure at startup. This reading is used to plot airflow on the fan tables provided, with \neach system using a fan to verify that the proper amount of airflow is being delivered through the \nsystem. About 50% of the available equipment out there is rated at 0.50-in. maximum total \neternal static pressure. Most variable speed fans are rated from 0.90-in. to 1.2-in. available fan \npressure.  Design practical standards ideally limit pressure drop over the coil to 40% of the rated \nequipment static pressure. Pressure drop over the filter is recommended to remain below 20% of \nthe equipment pressure. This leaves 40% of the available pressure for the duct system. The live \ntotal external static pressure after a system is built is the real test of system performance from a \npressure perspective. \n \n \nWhat to Calculate \n \nCalculating Gains in Efficiency:  By measuring the wet bulb temperature before and after the \nevaporator of an air conditioning system, the total heat load (enthalpy) in the air before and after \nthe evaporator can be determined. The difference is the heat that is removed by the evaporator \nand therefore the heat that is removed by the air conditioning system.", "tokens": 799, "chars": 3592, "pages": {"start": 5, "end": 6}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0004", "next_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0006", "content_hash": "sha256:f4a44a158d10f87afc59550c459f9764c562561dec24b4421ed0388b3f8937ed"}

The difference is the heat that is removed by the evaporator \nand therefore the heat that is removed by the air conditioning system. If the heat removed by the \nair conditioning system is calculated before and after treatment with PermaFrost NMR®, the \nchange of the system’s efficiency can be accurately quantified. This calculation can be made \neven if the ambient conditions are different when the first measurement is made and the second \nmeasurement is made.  Calculating the change in enthalpy allows regression using standard \nindustry accepted models and therefore is not necessary to attempt to control or replicate the \nvarious ambient conditions.  The airflow and voltage were measured before and after although it \nis generally it is assumed that the air flow and voltage is constant in the HVAC system.  This is a \nvalid assumption under most circumstances but measured for each of these tests. \n \nBTU Delivery:  Total heat removed by a cooling system can be measured. To do so requires a \nvery high quality psychrometer that measures wet bulb temperatures with extreme accuracy. It’s \nthe wet bulb temperature (the measures of both heat and humidity) that enables us to measure \ntotal Btu. \n \nThe formula that guides this test is timeless. It is simply CFM x Delta-T of the enthalpy derived \nfrom the entering air wet bulb temperature and the leaving air temperature x 4.5. In other words, \ntotal BTU equals delivered airflow (CFM) times the change in temperature and moisture content \nof the air through the system (Delta-T of E), times the constant of 4.5.

Taking accurate wet bulb \nreadings and converting the values to enthalpy easily and accurately measure the Delta-T of E \nthrough the system. Subtract the enthalpy readings to find the Delta-T of E.\n\n\n\n7\n \nSensible heating Btu is measured by CFM x Delta-T x 1.08. To measure heating Btu, multiply \nthe measure supply airflow (in CFM) by the temperature change from the average supply register \ntemperature to the average return grille temperature, and multiply this total by the formula \nconstant of 1.08. \n \nThe easiest way to find latent Btu is to subtract delivered sensible Btu from the delivered total \nBtu. A simple formula to find latent Btu is total Btu minus sensible Btu.  The 1.08 is a constant \nin the sensible Btu formula and is based on the air density under standard conditions. This is at \n70F, at sea level, and at 50% relative humidity. That weight is 0.075 lbs./cu ft. times the specific \nheat of standard air of 0.24 Btu/lb., times 60 minutes in an hour. We calculate Btu per hour \nbecause since we express Btu’s in per-hour units. The total Btu constant of 4.5 is found by \nmultiplying the weight of standard air of .075/lb. by 60 minutes in an hour. \n \nSystem Performance:  NCI’s acceptable standard for delivered Btu in a live system was only \n90% of rated equipment Btu capacity. Ninety percent is a tough standard for heating and cooling \nsystem performance. Currently, few contractors in the U.S. can achieve this level of performance \nin systems they service and sell.  \n \nInstrumentation:  The instruments utilized were certified for this test under NIST standards. \nIdentical data was gathered during the pre and post periods utilizing the identical instruments and \nthe identical methods.

First, does the product \nappear to provide the benefits suggested by the manufacturer? Second, was the process by which \ndata was gathered appear to meet the necessary requirements to demonstrate that benefit?  \n \nThe data collection protocol for the 49 in-situ DX units and 8 in-situ chillers appears to be in \nconformance with that suggested by the standards.  In-situ before and after results is indicative of \nthe initial results thereby eliminating the need to provide corrections.  However these short-term \ncomparisons do not necessarily portend long-term results.  A long-term comparison however is \nimpossible since all equipment is different and virtually every site has differing use and demand \ncharacteristics. Initial results appear to be appropriate, although continued periodic modeling \nwould be helpful to demonstrate the long-term results. Powertron Global has long term results \nthat are available from a major banking institution located in the southern United States.  \n \nThe four (4) units at the Juno Bach lab test site also followed the suggested protocol with the \nsame notes and caveats for the building sites.   \n \nThe requisite data was gathered and the calculations noted previously were developed.  The \nintent of these efforts is outlined in Table 1.  For example, voltage and amperage must be \nmeasured so that watts can be calculated.  The changes in voltage should be minimal as the \nelectrical system/motors drive the voltage required, however amperage measured affects the \ndraw upon the grid.  Higher amperage means more draw.  Since wattage includes both of these \nparameters, higher amperage means higher watts, and therefore more power demand from the \ngrid.  The desire is that the additive will decrease demand on the grid.  Likewise the remaining \nfactors are summarized.   \n \nWith respect to the evaluation of whether the technology PermaFrost NMR® works requires \ninvestigation into whether the goals for the parameters above were met.  Tables 2 and 3 compare \nthe results, including all the factors listed in Table 1 for DX units and CHillers.  Tables 4 and 5 \ndenote whether the goals of the technology (to improve efficiency and reduce draw on the grid) \nare met or not.  In all cases the PermaFrost NMR® met the intent.   \n \nTable 2 summary observations: \n \n• Voltage relatively constant \n• Amperage dropped at most sites after PermaFrost NMR® was added.  The overall \naverage was a decrease of 7% \n• Air flow was constant \n• Coil Capacity increased at each site that PermaFrost NMR® was installed with an \naverage of 29/4%. \n• The COP improved 13.3% \n• Watts per ton decreased at the three standard HVAC system sites by an average of \n20.3%, with a total average, adjusted wattage improvement of 16% \n• Efficiency improved by + 4.9% \n \nTable 3 observations (controlled lab site):", "tokens": 794, "chars": 3395, "pages": {"start": 22, "end": 24}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0020", "next_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0022", "content_hash": "sha256:68af4de99ee1570bb6e31df3be3f126bce06f90bbc9edbb4a05fb55984cba075"}

This report evaluates their in-situ test program to \ndetermine if measurable improvements can be demonstrated.  This would benefit power \nproviders if it was verified that the HVAC systems would operate more efficiently and \nreduce draw of power from the grid during peak periods.   \n \nThere are four questions to answer.  The first question is whether there is anything in \nPermaFrost NMR® that would reduce the refrigerant lubricating oil surface bonding, \nto allow it (the refrigeration oil) to be displaced by the PermaFrost NMR®.  The \nimprovements in coil performance certainly suggest that any barrier to heat exchange \nwas altered.  If no surface bonding alteration occurs, no improvement should be seen in \nthe short term.  Improvements were seen in all systems, so something changed in \nthe coils.   \n \nThe second question is whether the PermaFrost NMR® can adversely impact the \nrefrigerant flow.  Stabilizing the metal surface and removal of refrigerant oil from the \nheat exchangers will reduce laminar friction and improve refrigerant flow.  The \nimprovements measured at the tests included generally showed significant \nimprovement in heat exchange and no adverse impact to refrigerant flow.  The oil \nanalysis showing compatibility (no separation of the product) with all relevant \ncomponents in extended tolerances suggest the product should not adversely impact \nflow in normal operating conditions. \n \nAn accompanying question about product longevity inside a system has been asked, \nincluding one of the large utilities that currently provides rebates for PermaFrost \nNMR®.   An oil analysis in Appendix A shows all of the tests required to provide an \nanswer.   \n \nThe focus of this report was the fourth question, whether the efficiency can be \ndemonstrated under a series of conditions, both in-situ and controlled, and concurrently \nwhether the appropriate data was gathered.  The International Performance \nMeasurement and Verification Protocols (IPMVP), Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was \nthe option used for this report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American \nSociety of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The \nEfficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology \nfor determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and products.  \n \nThe test protocol for the measuring site parameters before and after PermaFrost \nNMR® addition at in-situ test units appears to be in conformance with the standards set \nfor such systems and appropriate efficiency measurements were taken.  It was \nrecommended that a baseline for any of these tests allowed the equipment to run for a \nnormal on/off cycling for a period of 15 to 20 days to allow for stabilization and steady \nstate. Although performance changes may appear immediately, it takes approximately \n2-4 weeks for PermaFrost NMR® to properly travel throughout the hermetic circuit.", "tokens": 773, "chars": 3453, "pages": {"start": 43, "end": 44}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0039", "next_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0041", "content_hash": "sha256:d0e6bdb3219a2880889f0e53bbd6d47d77825d20454acc0cf9b5b73f6ebd9551"}

It is \ncertainly in everyone’s interest that predicted savings are achieved and properly reported. \nNotably: \n \nenergy users need to have robust methods of verifying achievement of their energy policy \nobjectives, to get or maintain ISO 50001 certification for their management practices; \n \npotential purchasers of energy efficiency products or services want to know that their \npotential purchases have already proven themselves using widely recognized methods; \n \nactual purchasers of energy efficiency products or services need feedback on the \neffectiveness of their purchases, to help them fine tune performance and to inform further \npurchases; \n \ngovernments and utilities need to know that savings reported from energy efficiency \nprograms are grounded in actual field-measured results following a widely accepted \nprotocol. \nBasically, the knowledge that energy savings can be transparently reported is vital to the \nacceptance of energy efficiency proposals.  \n \nEVO is the only organization dedicated to provision of tools for this purpose. This IPMVP, now \nin its seventh edition, defines transparency in savings reports, while assembling best \npractice from around the world. EVO also publishes the IEEFP (International Energy Efficiency \nFinancing Protocol) to help energy efficiency investors indentify and invest in well managed \nenergy cost saving projects. \n \nIPMVP’s flexible framework of M&V Options allows practitioners to craft the right M&V Plan for \ntheir building or industrial facility, inspiring confidence in those who wish to harvest their \nfinancial and/or environmental benefits. Clear definition of terms, and heavy emphasis on \nconsistent and transparent methods are the core precepts of the IPMVP. Though application \ndetails are unique to each project, IPMVP’s flexible framework has been successfully applied to \nall types of energy efficiency techniques, for thousands of projects and programs, large and \nsmall, around the world.  \n \nIPMVP is the work of numerous volunteers and sponsors, listed herein and in previous editions. \nI would like to thank all those shown in the Acknowledgments section herein.

The IPMVP presents a \nframework and four measurement and verification (M&V) Options for transparently, reliably and \nconsistently reporting a project’s saving. M&V activities include site surveys, metering of energy \nor water flow(s), monitoring of independent variable(s), calculation, and reporting. When \nadhering to IPMVP’s recommendations, these M&V activities can produce verifiable savings \nreports. \nThe IPMVP is intended to be used by professionals as a basis for preparing savings reports. \nEach user must establish its own specific M&V Plan that addresses the unique characteristics of \nthe project. The IPMVP is not a standard and thus there is no formal compliance mechanism for \nthis document. Adherence with the IPMVP requires preparation of a project specific M&V Plan \nthat is consistent with IPMVP terminology. It must name the IPMVP Option(s) to be used, \nmetering monitoring and analysis methods to be used, quality assurance procedures to be \nfollowed, and person(s) responsible for the M&V. \nIPMVP Volume I Chapters are organized as follows: \n1. Introduces IPMVP and EVO.  \n2. Defines M&V, and lists eight uses for M&V techniques.  \n3. Lays the foundation of M&V by defining the underlying Principles of good M&V. The \nbalance of the document summarizes common industry methods for implementing these \nfundamental Principles. \n4. Defines the IPMVP Framework and its four Options. It presents the basic methodologies \nand adjustments to energy or water measurements needed to properly report savings. \nTables 2 and 4, and Figure 4 summarize the Options and offer guidance in choosing \namongst them for each application. \n5. Lists the topics that should be contained in an M&V Plan and gives guidance on design \ndecisions needed to make the M&V activity cost effective for all users of the savings \nreports. \n6. Defines a means of specifying the use of IPMVP and of claiming adherence with it. \n7. Presents key information that should be included in each savings report. \n8. Lists many additional issues that commonly arise in M&V design or reporting. \n9. Lists definitions of all italicized words in the document.  \n10. Provides a list of references and some useful other resources. \nAppendix A provides 12 example applications of IPMVP, in varying levels of detail. It refers to \nEVO’s website for detailed examples of M&V Plans and Savings Reports. \nAppendix B summarizes basic uncertainty quantification techniques to guide decisions about \nthe level of rigour suitable for each M&V process.  \nAppendix C contains region-specific materials for the United States of America, France, Spain \n(incl. Catalonia), Romania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Poland. \nAppendix D is a Users Guide to help different types of readers understand common ways of \napplying the document", "tokens": 741, "chars": 3406, "pages": {"start": 95, "end": 96}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0052", "next_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0054", "content_hash": "sha256:394f7176ba07c09270111cc7dfc1dd3f9000923055b20bb2ecf560f8844ef192"}

EVO envisions a \nglobal marketplace that correctly values the efficient use of natural resources and utilizes end-\nuse efficiency as a viable alternative to new energy supply. EVO’s mission is to develop and \npromote standardized methods to quantify and manage the risks and benefits associated with \nbusiness transactions on end-use energy efficiency, renewable energy, and water efficiency. \nEVO is a subscriber-based organization with supporters around the world.  \nEVO is grateful to its volunteers who develop and maintain EVO documents. Members of our \ncurrent Board and Committees active in developing this document appear in the \nAcknowledgements section, above, along with Organizational Subscribers.  \nEVO maintains a website (www.evo-world.org) which contains: \n \nA subscribers’ section with access to pre-release copies of some EVO documents, \nreference materials, newsletters, discussion forums, and links to other resources; \n \nLatest released editions of the documents, and archival editions; \n \nLists of the current committee members and supporters;  \n \nInvitation for comments on IPMVP documents to the email address of: ipmvprev@evo-\nworld.org ; \n \nInformation on EVO’s training and certification programs;    \nEVO documents should include unique methods from around the world. Therefore, EVO is \ndeveloping international, regional groups to document international M&V methods. To \nparticipate as a volunteer or subscriber, please visit the EVO website, www.evo-world.org, for \ncurrent contact information. \nEVO’s current activities and plans are summarized below.   \nEVO’s Current Publications \nCurrently EVO has four publications available on its website: \nIPMVP Volume I  Concepts and Options for Determining Energy and Water Savings \nVolume I defines terminology and suggests good practices for documenting the effectiveness of \nenergy or water efficiency projects that are implemented in buildings and industrial facilities.  \nThese terms and practices help managers to prepare M&V Plans, which specify how savings \nwill be measured for each project. The successful M&V Plan enables verification by requiring \ntransparent reports of actual project performance. \nIPMVP Volume II  Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) Issues \nVolume II reviews IEQ issues as they may be influenced by an energy efficiency project. It \nhighlights good project design and implementation practices for maintaining acceptable indoor \nconditions under an energy efficiency project. It advises on means of measuring IEQ \nparameters to substantiate whether indoor conditions have changed from the conditions of the \nbaseline when determining savings. Volume II has been archived, and remains available in the \narchives section of the public library on EVO’s website. \nIPMVP Volume III   Applications \nVolume III contains specific application guidance manuals for Volume I.

It was modified in December 1997 then renamed the \nInternational Performance Measurment and Verification Protocol. Options A and B were \nchanged substantially when IPMVP was re-published in 2001 and minor editorial changes were \nadded in a 2002 edition. Volume II on Indoor Environmental Quality was published in 2002. \nCommittees, sponsored by the United States’ Department of Energy (DOE) wrote and edited \nthese documents. \nIn 2002, IPMVP Inc. was incorporated as an independent non-profit corporation in order to \ninclude the international community and relieve the U.S. Department of Energy of its \nresponsibilities as the organizer.  IPMVP Inc. raised its own funds, created a website, and \npublished the new Volume III Parts on New Construction and Renewables. In 2004, IPMVP Inc. \nwas renamed Efficiency Valuation Organization as it expanded its focus.   \nIn 2007, EVO updated IPMVP Volume I primarily for clarity, thought re-writing the uncertainty \nAppendix B. No substantive changes were made to the core concepts, though the titles of \nOptions A & B were expanded along with their descriptive materials, to ensure proper \nunderstanding. In 2009, Volume I was modified to separate USA-specific references and to \nestablish a structure for many region-specific materials in a new Appendix C for the USA and \nFrance. . In 2010, Volume I was modified to add more European references and Appendices, \nand updated the significant digitis presentation. \nTraining And Certification \nEVO recognizes that documents alone will not improve the valuation of energy efficiency in the \nworld. Therefore EVO and its world wide partners introduced awareness and training programs \nabout measurement and verification. These programs educate professionals on methods and \nrecent developments in M&V. \nEVO also has a Certified Measurement and Verification Professional (CVMP) program for  \nprofessionals who pass a test demonstrating their knowledge of IPMVP and have appropriate \nknowledge experience or training. CMVP®s should be competent to develop M&V Plans and to \nmanage M&V programs for straightforward applications. For more information on the CMVP® \nprogram, and for the names of designated CMVP®s, visit www.evo-world.org . \nEVO’s Future Plans \nEVO’s subscribers, and volunteers determine its future plans to create new educational efforts \nand documents about efficiency valuation. EVO welcomes IPMVP readers to become EVO \nsubscribers, provide recommendations, and participate in new and existing EVO activities.   \nIn light of its international focus, EVO is in the process of: \n \nDeveloping active regional affiliates who contribute to the development and maintenance of \nEVO publications;  \n \nConducting additional training and certification programs around the world; \n \nPreparing its latest documents in a variety of languages; and", "tokens": 770, "chars": 3755, "pages": {"start": 97, "end": 98}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0054", "next_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0056", "content_hash": "sha256:dc97878250ff8b8b3bd227a1c0bdb00b43721b4a1386c7eafa08614a8801e8ab"}

An M&V Plan must be developed for each project by a qualified \nprofessional3. \n \nIPMVP applies to a wide variety of facilities including existing and new buildings and \nindustrial processes. Chapter 1.4, User’s Guide, summarizes how different readers might \nuse IPMVP. \nIPMVP Volume I defines M&V in Chapter 2, presents the fundamental principles of M&V in \nChapter 3, and describes a framework for a detailed M&V Plan in Chapter 4. The details of an \nM&V Plan and savings report are listed in Chapters 5 and 6, respectively. The requirements for \nspecifying use of IPMVP or claiming adherence with IPMVP are shown in Chapter 7. Volume I \nalso contains a summary of common M&V design issues, Chapter 8, and lists other M&V \nresources.

Where financial payments are based on \ndemonstrated energy or water savings, adherenece to IPMVP ensures that savings follow \ngood practice. An IPMVP-adherent savings report allows a customer, an energy user or a \nutility, to readily accept reported performance. Energy service companies (ESCOs) whose \ninvoices are supported by IPMVP-adherent savings reports, usually receive prompt \npayments. \n \nLower transaction costs in an energy performance contract. Specification of IPMVP as the \nbasis for designing a project’s M&V can simplify the negotiations for an energy performance \ncontract. \n \nInternational credibility for energy savings reports, thereby increasing the value to a buyer of \nthe associated energy savings. \n \nEnhanced rating under programs to encourage or label sustainably designed and/ or \noperated facilities. \n \nHelp national and industry organizations promote and achieve resource efficiency and \nenvironmental objectives. The IPMVP is widely adopted by national and regional \ngovernment agencies and by industry organizations to help manage their programs and \nenhance the credibility of their reported results. \n1.3   IPMVP’s Relationship To Other M&V Guidelines \nChapter 9 lists other interesting resources for readers of IPMVP. Appendix C lists other \nguidelines, protocols, and documents from different regions of the world that are applications of \nIPMVP, or provide references to relevant codes, standards, and programs that reference \nIPMVP. \n1.4   Who Uses IPMVP? \nIPMVP presents common principles and terms that are widely accepted as basic to any good \nM&V process. It does not define the M&V activities for all applications. Each project must be \nindividually designed to suit the needs of all readers of energy or water savings reports.  This \nindividual design is recorded in the project’s M&V Plan and savings are reported as defined \ntherein.  \nThis document is written to progressively provide greater levels of definition of M&V practice as \nit progresses through the Chapters as summarized below. \n \nChapter 2 defines M&V and descibes eight different applications for M&V techniques. \n \nChapter 3 present the six foundational principles of good M&V practice and the IPMVP. \nThey are useful for guiding M&V design details where IPMVP is silent.  \n \nChapter 4 presents the general framework and savings computation equations needed to \nproperly express savings.

Savings cannot be directly measured, since they represent the absence of energy \nuse. Instead, savings are determined by comparing measured use before and after \nimplementation of a project, making appropriate adjustments for changes in conditions.  \nM&V activities consist of some or all of the following: \n \nmeter installation calibration and maintenance,  \n \ndata gathering and screening, \n \ndevelopment of a computation method and acceptable estimates,  \n \ncomputations with measured data, and \n \nreporting, quality assurance, and third party verification of reports.  \nWhen there is little doubt about the outcome of a project, or no need to prove results to another \nparty, applying M&V methods to calculate savings may not be necessary. However, it is still \nwise to verify (initially and repeatedly) that the installed equipment is able to produce the \nexpected savings. Verification of the potential to achieve savings is referred to as operational \nverification,  which may involve inspection, commissioning of equipment, functional performance \ntesting and/or data trending (see Section 4.4. below). IPMVP-adherent M&V includes both \noperational verification and an accounting of savings based on site energy measurements \nbefore and after implementation of a project, and adjustments, as described above.   \nM&V is not just a collection of tasks conducted to help a project meet IPMVP requirements. \nProperly integrated, each  M&V task serves to enhance and improve facility operation and \nmaintenance of savings. As shown in Figure 1, M&V activities overlap with other project efforts \n(e.g. collecting data to both identify ECMs and establish energy baselines, commissioning and \noperational verification of installed ECMs, and installing monitoring systems to track and \nmaintain savings persistence, etc.). Identifying these project synergies and establishing roles \nand responsibilities of involved parties during project planning will support a coordinated team \neffort. This can leverage complementary scopes and control M&V-related costs.  \n \nPlan\n• Identify ECMs\n• Document \nbaseline energy\n• Plan and \ncoordinate \nM&V activities\n• Design ECMs\nInstall\n• Install ECMs\n• Commission\n• Verify \nOperations\nMaintain\n• Gather data\n• Verify Savings\n• Report\n• Document \nproject feedback\n• Assure \npersistence\n \n                                                  \n4 Words in italics have the special meanings defined in Chapter 9. \n \n \nFigure 1 \nProcess \nTimeline \n(M&V \nactivities in \nbold)", "tokens": 653, "chars": 3130, "pages": {"start": 103, "end": 104}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0058", "next_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0060", "content_hash": "sha256:5106bd5e0b553edf120798a8d8b3dfe503faf1a9d7054be946191acbb3ae32e2"}

This feedback helps them adjust \nECM design or operations to improve savings, achieve greater persistence of savings over time, \nand lower variations in savings (Kats et al. 1997 and 1999, Haberl et al. 1996).  \nb)   Document financial transactions \nFor some projects, the energy efficiency savings are the basis for performance-based financial \npayments and/or a guarantee in a performance contract. A well-defined and implemented M&V \nPlan can be the basis for documenting performance in a transparent manner and subjected to \nindependent verification. \nc)   Enhance financing for efficiency projects  \nA good M&V Plan increases the transparency and credibility of reports on the outcome of \nefficiency investments. It also increases the credibility of projections for the outcome of \nefficiency investments. This credibility can increase the confidence that investors and sponsors \nhave in energy efficiency projects, enhancing their chances of being financed.  \nd)   Improve engineering design and facility operations and maintenance  \nThe preparation of a good M&V Plan encourages comprehensive project design by including all \nM&V costs in the project’s economics. Good M&V also helps managers discover and reduce \nmaintenance and operating problems, so they can run facilities more effectively. Good M&V \nalso provides feedback for future project designs. \ne)  Manage energy budgets  \nEven where savings are not planned, M&V techniques help managers evaluate and manage \nenergy usage to account for variances from budgets. M&V techniques are used to adjust for \nchanging facility-operating conditions in order to set proper budgets and account for budget \nvariances.  \nf)   Enhance the value of emission-reduction credits \nAccounting for emission reductions provides additional value to efficiency projects. Use of an \nM&V Plan for determining energy savings improves emissions-reduction reports compared to \nreports with no M&V Plan.   \ng)  Support evaluation of regional efficiency programs \nUtilty or government programs for managing the usage of an energy supply system can use \nM&V techniques to evaluate the savings at selected energy user facilities. Using statistical \ntechniques and other assumptions, the savings determined by M&V activities at selected \nindividual facilities can help predict savings at unmeasured sites in order to report the \nperformance of the entire program.  \nh)   Increase public understanding of energy management as a public policy tool  \nBy improving the credibility of energy management projects, M&V increases public acceptance \nof the related emission reduction. Such public acceptance encourages investment in energy-\nefficiency projects or the emission credits they may create.

M&V costs should \nnormally be small relative to the monetary value of the savings being evaluated. M&V \nexpenditures should also be consistent with the financial implications of over- or under-reporting \nof a project’s performance. Accuracy tradeoffs should be accompanied by increased \nconservativeness in any estimates and judgements.  \nComplete  The reporting of energy savings should consider all effects of a project. M&V \nactivities should use measurements to quantify the significant effects, while estimating all \nothers.  \nConservative  Where judgements are made about uncertain quantities, M&V procedures \nshould be designed to under-estimate savings.  \nConsistent  The reporting of a project’s energy effectiveness should be consistent between: \n \ndifferent types of energy efficiency projects; \n \ndifferent energy management professionals for any one project; \n \ndifferent periods of time for the same project; and \n \nenergy efficiency projects and new energy supply projects. \n‘Consistent’ does not mean ‘identical,’ since it is recognized that any empirically derived report \ninvolves judgements which may not be made identically by all reporters. By identifying key \nareas of judgement, IPMVP helps to avoid inconsistencies arising from lack of consideration of \nimportant dimensions. \nRelevant The determination of savings should measure the performance parameters of \nconcern, or least well known, while other less critical or predictable parameters may be \nestimated.  \nTransparent  All M&V activities should be clearly and fully disclosed.

At about the time of ECM installation, plant production also \nincreased.  \nTo properly document the impact of the ECM, its energy effect must be separated from the \nenergy effect of the increased production. The “baseline energy” use pattern before ECM \ninstallation was studied to determine the relationship between energy use and production. \nFollowing ECM installation, this baseline relationship was used to estimate how much energy \nthe plant would have used each month if there had been no ECM (called the “adjusted-baseline \nenergy”). The saving, or ‘avoided energy use’ is the difference between the adjusted-baseline \nenergy and the energy that was actually metered during the reporting period.  \nWithout the adjustment for the change in production, the difference between baseline energy \nand reporting period energy would have been much lower, under-reporting the effect of the heat \nrecovery. \nIt is necessary to segregate the energy effects of a savings program from the effects of other \nsimultaneous changes affecting the energy using systems. The comparison of before and after \nenergy use or demand should be made on a consistent basis, using the following general \nEquation 1):  \n \n                                                  \n6 Words in italics have the special meanings defined in Chapter 9. \n \nFigure 2  Example Energy \nHistory", "tokens": 498, "chars": 2464, "pages": {"start": 106, "end": 107}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0061", "next_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0063", "content_hash": "sha256:0c1d5af8ef8a6fea10dca510ae37e8526744b15577013a7d3670e716a61eb6d1"}

This adjustments term \ndistinguishes proper savings reports from a simple comparison of cost or usage before and after \nimplementation of an energy conservation measure (ECM). Simple comparisons of utility costs \nwithout such adjustments report only cost changes and fail to report the true performance of a \nproject. To properly report “savings,” adjustments must account for the differences in conditions \nbetween the baseline and reporting periods.  \nThe baseline in an existing facility project is usually the performance of the facility or system \nprior to modification. This baseline physically exists and can be measured before changes are \nimplemented. In new construction, the baseline is usually hypothetical and defined based on \ncode, regulation, common practice or documented performance of similar facilities. In either \ncase, the baseline model must be capable of accomodating changes in operating parameters \nand conditions so “adjustments” can be made. \n \nThe balance of this Chapter defines basic methods in these measurement and adjustment \nprocesses. If these methods do not cover all matters that arise in your project, consult the \nPrinciples of M&V (Chapter 3) for further guidance. \n4.2  Energy, Water and Demand Terminology \nThe processes of determining savings in energy are analogous to those for determining savings \nin water or demand. To simplify the descriptions in this document, the italicized word energy will \ncommonly be used to mean energy and water use or demand. Similarly the word Energy \nConservation Measure (ECM) will commonly be used to mean measures to improve efficiency \nor conserve energy or water, or manage demand.  \n4.3  The M&V Design and Reporting Process  \nThe M&V design and reporting process parallels the ECM design and implementation process. \nThe M&V processes should involve the following steps:  \n1. Consider the needs of the user of the planned M&V report(s). If the user is focused on \noverall cost control, Whole-Facility methods may be most suited. If user focus is on \nparticular ECMs, Retrofit Isolation techniques may be most suited (see Chapter 4.4). \n2. While developing the ECM(s), select the IPMVP Option (see Chapters 4.7 - 4.11) that best \nsuits the ECM(s), the needs for accuracy and the budget for M&V. Decide whether \nadjustment of all energy quantities will be made to the reporting period conditions or to some \nother set of conditions (see Chapter 4.6). Decide the duration of the baseline period and the \nreporting period (Chapter 4.5) (These fundamental decisions may be written into the terms \nof an energy-performance contract.)  \n3. Gather relevant energy and operating data from the baseline period and record them in a \nway that can be accessed in the future.  \n4. Prepare an M&V Plan (Chapter 5) containing the results of steps 1 through 3 above. It \nshould define the subsequent steps 5 through 9.  \n5.

It serves as a \nlow-cost initial step for realizing savings potential and should precede savings verification \nactivities.  A range of operational verification methods can be applied, as outlined in Table 2. \nSelection of a given approach depends on the ECM’s characteristics as noted. However, it can \nalso be influenced by the savings verification approach taken. For example, if Option B is being \nused to verify savings then a more simple visual inspection may suffice for operational \nverification. However if Option A is applied, then a more thorough operational verification \napproach should be used to verify that the ECM functionality is confirmed and characterization \ncomplete.  \nOperational verification activities are accomplished through comprehensive commissioning of \naffected systems supplemented by more data-driven activities (e.g. data trending and review). \nThe M&V Plan should note the operational verification approach in addition to the savings \nverification method. Operational verification should be completed prior to implementing M&V \nsavings verification activities. This ensures the savings from ECMs, energy-efficient controls \nand operation improvements are fully realized.  \nInteractive Effects - Example\n \nFor an ECM, which reduces the power requirements of electric lights, the \nmeasurement boundary should include the power to the lights. However lowering \nlighting energy may also lower any mechanical cooling requirements and/or raise \nany heating requirements.

Component \nor system is being monitored and \ncontrolled through the BAS or can be \nmonitored through independent meters. \nSet up trends and review data and/or \ncontrol logic. Measurement period may \nlast for a few days to a few weeks, \ndepending on the period needed to \ncapture the full range of performance. \n \nOperational verification activities can also be applied following the Reporting Period to support \nenergy savings persistence. While ot formally a part of the M&V process, such a practice is \nbeneficial for an organization which has improved its energy efficiency.  It reduces the risk of \nadverse shifts in performance associated with ECMs that can fail, fade or be bypassed.  \n4.5 Savings Verification  \nThe following sections add details about how to determine and report savings.  \n4.5.1  Measurement Boundary  \nSavings may be determined for an entire facility or simply for a portion of it, depending upon the \npurposes of the reporting. \n \nIf the purpose of reporting is to help manage only the equipment affected by the savings \nprogram, a measurement boundary should be drawn around that equipment. Then all \nsignificant energy requirements of the equipment within the boundary can be determined7. \nThis approach is used in the Retrofit Isolation Options of Chapter 4.7.  \n \nIf the purpose of reporting is to help manage total facility energy performance, the meters \nmeasuring the supply of energy to the total facility can be used to assess performance and \nsavings. The measurement boundary in this case encompasses the whole facility. The \nWhole Facility Option C, is described in Chapter 4.8.   \n \nIf baseline or reporting period data are unreliable or unavailable, energy data from a \ncalibrated simulation program can take the place of the missing data, for either part or all of \nthe facility. The measurement boundary can be drawn accordingly. The Calibrated \nSimulation Option D is described in Chapter 4.9.  \n                                                  \n7 Determination of energy may be by direct measurement of energy flow or by direct measurement of proxies of \nenergy use that give direct indication of energy use.  \n \nTable 1 \nOperational \nVerification \nApproaches", "tokens": 754, "chars": 3790, "pages": {"start": 109, "end": 110}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0064", "next_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0066", "content_hash": "sha256:fe9e8fd7757ed7edb0c31b41fe798c39e6a7d53e7709ac5b5c472648c05686cd"}

Nevertheless, all energy effects of the ECM(s) \nshould be considered. Those energy effects that are significant should be determined from \nmeasurements, the rest being estimated or ignored.  \nAny energy effects occurring beyond the notional measurement boundary are called ‘interactive \neffects’8. Find a way to estimate the magnitude of these interactive effects in order to determine \nsavings. Alternatively they may be ignored as long as the M&V Plan includes discussion of each \neffect and its likely magnitude. \n4.5.2  Measurement Period Selection \nCare should be taken in selecting the period of time to be used as the baseline period and the \nreporting period. Strategies for each are discussed below. \nBaseline Period \nThe baseline period should be established to: \n \nRepresent all operating modes of the facility. This period should span a full operating cycle \nfrom maximum energy use to minimum.   \n \n \n \n \nFairly represent all operating conditions of a normal operating cycle. For example, though a \nyear may be chosen as the baseline period, if data is missing during the selected year for \none month, comparable data for the same month in a different year should be used to \nensure the baseline record does not under represent operating conditions of the missing \nmonth.   \n \nInclude only time periods for which all fixed and variable energy-governing facts are known \nabout the facility. Extension of baseline periods backwards in time to include multiple cycles \nof operation requires equal knowledge of all energy-governing factors throughout the longer \nbaseline period in order to properly derive routine and non-routine adjustments (see Chapter \n4.6) after ECM installation. \n \nCoincide with the period immediately before commitment to undertake the retrofit. Periods \nfurther back in time would not reflect the conditions existing before retrofit and may therefore \nnot provide a proper baseline for measuring the effect of just the ECM. \nECM planning may require study of a longer time period than is chosen for the baseline period. \nLonger study periods assist the planner in understanding facility performance and determining \nwhat the normal cycle length actually is. \n                                                  \n8 These interactive effects are sometimes called ‘leakages.’ \n \nWhole-building energy use can be significantly affected by weather conditions. \nTypically, a whole year of baseline data is needed to define a full operating \ncycle. \n \n \nThe energy use of a compressed air system may only be governed by plant \nproduction levels, which vary on a weekly cycle. So one week’s data may be \nall that is needed to define baseline performance.", "tokens": 631, "chars": 3236, "pages": {"start": 110, "end": 111}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0065", "next_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0067", "content_hash": "sha256:7020ee21ca363872b860f2e43d8500b533688a7c315056861a4914d1a0527f11"}

The \nreporting period should encompass at least one normal operating cycle of the equipment or \nfacility, in order to fully characterize the savings effectiveness in all normal operating modes.  \nSome projects may cease reporting savings after a defined \"test\" period ranging from an \ninstantaneous reading to a year or two.  \nThe length of any reporting period should be determined with due consideration of the life of the \nECM and the likelihood of degradation of originally achieved savings over time.  \nRegardless of the length of the reporting period, metering may be left in place to provide \nfeedback of operating data for routine management purposes and specifically to detect \nsubsequent adverse changes in performance. Section 4.9 explains this at greater length. \nIf reducing the frequency of savings measurement after initial proof of performance, other on \nsite monitoring activities could be intensified to ensure savings remain in place.  \nIPMVP-adherent savings can only be reported for the reporting period that uses IPMVP-\nadherent procedures. If IPMVP-adherent savings are used as a basis for assuming future \nsavings, future savings reports do not adhere to IPMVP.  \nAdjacent Measurement Periods (On/Off Test) \nWhen an ECM can be turned on and off easily, baseline and reporting periods may be selected \nthat are adjacent to each other in time. A change in control logic is an example of an ECM that \ncan often be readily removed and reinstated without affecting the facility. \nSuch “On/Off tests” involve energy measurements with the ECM in effect, and then immediately \nthereafter with the ECM turned off so that pre-ECM (baseline) conditions return. The difference \nin energy use between the two adjacent measurement periods is the savings created by the \nECM. Equation 1) of Chapter 4.1 can be used for computing savings, without an adjustments \nterm if all energy-influencing factors are the same in the two adjacent periods. \nThis technique can be applied under both Retrofit Isolation and Whole-Facility Options. \nHowever measurement boundaries must be located so that it is possible to readily detect a \nsignificant difference in metered energy use when equipment or systems are turned on and off.   \nThe adjacent periods used for the On/Off test should be long enough to represent stable \noperation. The periods should also cover the range of normal facility operations. To cover the \nnormal range, the On/Off test may need to be repeated under different operating modes such as \nvarious seasons or production rates. \nTake notice that ECMs which can be turned Off for such testing also risk being accidentally or \nmaliciously turned Off when intended to be On. \n4.5.3  Basis For Adjustments \nThe adjustments term shown in Equation 1) of Chapter 4.1 should be computed from identifiable \nphysical facts about the energy governing characteristics of equipment within the measurement \nboundary. Two types of adjustments are possible: \n \nRoutine Adjustments – for any energy-governing factors, expected to change routinely \nduring the reporting period, such as weather or production volume. A variety of techniques \ncan be used to define the adjustment methodology. Techniques may be as simple as a \nconstant value (no adjustment) or as complex as a several multiple parameter non-linear \nequations each correlating energy with one or more independent variables.

For example, \nequipment operating parameters of electrical load and operating hours can be measured \nseparately and multiplied together to compute the equipment’s energy use. \n \nMeasurement of proven proxies for energy use. For example, if the energy use of a motor \nhas been correlated to the output signal from the variable speed drive controlling the motor, \nthe output signal could be a proven proxy for motor energy. \n \nComputer simulation that is calibrated to some actual performance data for the system or \nfacility being modeled. One example of computer simulation is DOE-2 analysis for buildings \n(Option D only).  \nIf the a energy value is already known with adequate accuracy or when it is more costly to \nmeasure than justified by the circumstances, then measurement of energy may not be \nnecessary or appropriate. In these cases, estimates may be made of some ECM parameters, \nbut others must be measured (Option A only).   \nIPMVP provides four Options for determining savings (A, B, C and D). The choice among the \nOptions involves many considerations including the location of the measurement boundary (see \nChapter 4.4).

Retrofit isolation allows the narrowing of the measurement boundary in order to \nreduce the effort required to monitor independent variables and static factors, when retrofits \naffect only a portion of the facility. However boundaries smaller than the total facility usually \nrequire additional meters at the measurement boundary. Narrow measurement boundaries also \nintroduce the possibility of ‘leakage’ through unmeasured interactive effects.  \nSince measurement is of less than the total facility, the results of retrofit isolation techniques \ncannot be correlated to the facility’s total energy use shown on utility bills. Facility changes \nbeyond the measurement boundary but unrelated to the ECM will not be reported by retrofit-\nisolation techniques but will be included in the utility’s metered consumption or demand. \n \nTable 2 \nOverview of \nIPMVP \nOptions", "tokens": 633, "chars": 2952, "pages": {"start": 117, "end": 118}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0072", "next_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0074", "content_hash": "sha256:8a5cb23838196e4161a10ea33a36945b2ae24a87ee45378967783545cfbeea89"}

A \nmethod must be derived for estimating such \ninteractive effects (See Chapter 4.4). For \nexample, a lighting load reduction often reduces \nHVAC system energy use, but the only \nreasonable measurement boundary would \nencompass just the electricity use of the lights, \nnot their heating and cooling energy impacts. In \nthis case the ECM’s effect on HVAC energy \nrequirements is an interactive effect, which must \nbe assessed. If the interactive effect is expected \nto be significant, engineering estimates could be \nmade of the interactive effect as some fraction of \nthe measured lighting-energy savings. \nConventional heating and cooling calculations \nwould be used to determine the appropriate \nfraction(s) for each season. However if the \nmeasurement boundary can be expanded to \nencompass interactive effects, there is no need to \nestimate them. \nApart from small estimated interactive effects, the measurement boundary defines the metering \npoints and the scope of any adjustments, which may be used in the various forms of Equation \n1). Only changes to energy systems and operating variables within the measurement boundary \nmust be monitored to prepare the adjustments term(s) of Equation 1).   \nChapter 4.5 discusses measurement periods, generally. Parameters may be continuously \nmeasured or periodically measured for short periods. The expected amount of variation in the \nparameter will govern the decision of whether to measure continuously or periodically. Where a \nparameter is not expected to change it may be measured immediately after ECM installation \nand checked occasionally throughout the reporting period. The frequency of this checking can \nbe determined by beginning with frequent measurements to verify that the parameter is \nconstant. Once proven constant, the frequency of measurement may be reduced. To maintain \ncontrol on savings as measurement frequency drops, more frequent inspections or other tests \nmight be undertaken to verify proper operations. \nContinuous metering provides greater certainty in reported savings and more data about \nequipment operation. This information can be used to improve or optimize the operation of the \nequipment on a real-time basis, thereby improving the benefit of the ECM itself. Results from \nseveral studies have shown five to fifteen percent annual energy savings can be achieved \nthrough careful use of continuous data logging (Claridge et al. 1994, 1996; Haberl et al. 1995).  \nIf measurement is not continuous and meters are removed between readings, the location of the \nmeasurement and the specifications of the measurement device should be recorded in the M&V \nPlan, along with the procedure for calibrating the meter being used.

Examples of such day-type profiling can be found in Katipamula \nand Haberl (1991), Akbari et al. (1988), Hadley and Tomich (1986), Bou Saada and Haberl \n(1995a, 1995b) and Bou Saada et al. (1996).  \nWhere multiple versions of the same ECM installation are included within the measurement \nboundary, statistically valid samples may be used as valid measurements of the total parameter. \nSuch situations may arise, for example, where total lighting power draw cannot be read at the \nelectrical panel due to the presence of non-lighting loads on the same panel. Instead a \nstatistically significant sample of fixtures is measured before and after retrofit to assess the \nchange in power draw. These sample data may be used as the ‘measurements’ of total lighting \npower draw.

Therefore power draw should \nbe treated as an estimate in designing an \nOption A procedure. \nAs a result, operating hours must be \nmeasured if the procedure is to adhere to \nIPMVP Option A.\n4.7.1  Option A: Retrofit Isolation: Key Parameter Measurement  \nUnder Option A, Retrofit Isolation: Key Parameter Measurement, energy quantities in Equation \n1) can be derived from a computation using a combination of measurements of some \nparameters and estimates of the others. Such estimates should only be used where it can be \nshown that the combined uncertainty from all such estimates will not significantly affect the \noverall reported savings. Decide which parameters to measure and which to estimate by \nconsidering each parameter’s contribution to the overall uncertainty of the reported savings. The \nestimated values and analysis of their significance should be included in the M&V Plan (Chapter \n5). Estimates may be based on historical data such as recorded operating hours from the \nbaseline, equipment manufacturer’s published ratings, laboratory tests, or typical weather data.   \nIf a parameter, such as hours of use is known to be constant and not expected to be impacted \nby the ECM, then its measurement in the reporting period is sufficient. The reporting period \nmeasurement of such constant parameter can also be considered a measurement of its \nbaseline value.  \nWherever a parameter, known to vary independently, is not measured in the facility during both \nthe baseline and reporting periods, the parameter should be treated as an estimate.  \nEngineering calculations or mathematical modeling may be used to assess the significance of \nthe errors in estimating any parameter in the reported savings. For example if a piece of \nequipment’s operating hours are to be estimated, but may range from 2,100 to 2,300 hours per \nyear, the calculated savings at 2,100 and 2,300 hours should be computed and the difference \nevaluated for its significance to the expected savings. The combined effect of all such possible \nestimations should be assessed before determining whether sufficient measurement is in place. \nSee also Appendix B-5.1.  \nThe selection of which factor(s) to measure may also be considered relative to the objectives of \nthe project or the duties of a contractor undertaking some ECM-performance risk. Where a \nfactor is significant to assessing performance, it should be measured. Other factors beyond the \ncontractor’s control can be estimated.  \nIf a savings computation involves subtracting a measured parameter from an estimated \nparameter, the result is an estimate. For \nexample if a parameter is measured in the \nreporting period and subtracted from an \nunmeasured value for the same parameter in \nthe baseline period, the resultant difference is \nonly an estimate.  \nAn example application of Option A is an \nECM involving the installation of high-\nefficiency light fixtures, without changing \nlighting periods.", "tokens": 792, "chars": 3865, "pages": {"start": 120, "end": 121}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0075", "next_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0077", "content_hash": "sha256:96debd3ed820bbb03d142c6e028b9097761f4cd432919b16e1c33f387319b229"}

The following \nthree examples show the range of scenarios that may arise.  \n \nECM reduces a constant load without changing its operating hours. Example: industrial-\nplant lighting fixtures are replaced with more efficient ones, but the operating hours of the \nlights do not change. To reasonably measure the effect of the project, fixture power levels \nshould be measured in the baseline and reporting periods, while operating hours are \nestimated in the energy calculations. \n \nECM reduces operating hours while load is unchanged. Example: automatic controls shut \ndown air compressors during unoccupied periods. To reasonably measure the effect of the \nproject, compressors’ operating time should be measured in both the baseline and reporting \nperiods, while compressors’ power can be estimated in the energy calculations. \n \nECM reduces both equipment load and operating hours. Example: Resetting of temperature \non a hot-water radiation system reduces overheating and induces occupants to close \nwindows, thereby reducing boiler load and operating periods. When both load and operating \nperiods are variable and uncertain, Option A cannot be used. \nGenerally, conditions of variable load or variable operating hours require more rigorous \nmeasurement and computations.   \nOption A: Calculations \nGeneral Equation 1) in Chapter 4.1 is used in all IPMVP adherent computations.

The frequency of these re-inspections is determined by the likelihood of \nperformance changes. Such likelihood can be established through initial frequent inspections to \nestablish the stability of equipment existence and performance.  \nAn example of a situation needing routine re-inspection is a lighting retrofit. You can determine \nsavings by sampling of the performance of fixtures and counting the number of operating \nfixtures. In this case, the continued existence of the fixtures and operation of the lamps is critical \nto the savings determination. Similarly, where the settings of controls are assumed, but subject \nto tampering, regular recordings of control settings or actual equipment functions can limit the \nuncertainty of the estimated values.  \nOption A: Cost  \nSavings determinations under Option A can be less costly than under other Options, since the \ncost of estimating a parameter is often significantly less than the cost of measurement.

These meters may be installed during an energy audit to help characterize \nenergy use before design of the ECM. Or meters may be installed to measures baseline \nperformance for an M&V Plan.  \nYou can measure temperature, humidity, flow, pressure, equipment runtime, electricity or \nthermal energy, for example, at the measurement boundary. Follow good measurement \npractices to enable calculation of energy savings with reasonable accuracy and repeatability. \nMeasurement practices are continually evolving as metering equipment improves. Therefore, \nuse the latest measurement practices to support your savings (see also Chapter 8.11).  \nThe following sections define some key measurement issues to consider when using retrofit-\nisolation techniques.   \nElectricity Measurements \nTo measure electricity accurately we measure the voltage, amperage and power factor, or true \nrms10 wattage with a single instrument. However measurement of amperage and voltage alone \ncan adequately define wattage in purely resistive loads, such as incandescent lamps and \nresistance heaters without blower motors. When measuring power, make sure that a resistive \nload’s electrical wave-form is not distorted by other devices in the facility.  \nMeasure electric demand at the same time that the power company determines the peak \ndemand for its billing. This measurement usually requires continuous recording of the demand \nat the sub-meter. From this record, the sub-meter’s demand can be read for the time when the \npower company reports that the peak demand occurred on its meter. The power company may \nreveal the time of peak demand either on its invoices or by special report.  \nElectric-demand measurement methods vary amongst utilities. The method of measuring \nelectric demand on a sub-mter should replicate the method the power company uses for the \nrelevant billing meter. For example, if the power company calculates peak demand using fixed \n                                                  \n10 Rms (root mean squared) values can be reported by solid state digital instruments to properly account for the net \npower when wave distortions exist in alternating current circuits.", "tokens": 724, "chars": 3658, "pages": {"start": 123, "end": 124}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0078", "next_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0080", "content_hash": "sha256:62f5c7b9763ebb0092e85dfbc4217de043d2f35c20f64fa58d9095183fa3498e"}

However if the power company uses a moving interval to record electric \ndemand data, the data recorder should have similar capabilities. Such moving interval capability \ncan be emulated by recording data on one minute fixed intervals and then recreating the power \ncompany’s intervals using post-processing software. However, care should be taken to ensure \nthat the facility does not contain unusual combinations of equipment that generate high one \nminute peak loads which may show up differently in a moving interval than in a fixed interval. \nAfter processing the data into power company intervals, convert it to hourly data for archiving \nand further analysis. \nCalibration \nMeters should  be calibrated as recommended by the equipment manufacturer, and following \nprocedures of recognized measurement authorities. Primary standards and no less than third-\norder-standard traceable calibration equipment should be utilized wherever possible. Sensors \nand metering equipment should be selected based in part on the ease of calibration and the \nability to hold calibration. An attractive solution is the selection of equipment that is self-\ncalibrating. \nSelected calibration references  are provided in Chapter 10.3.  \n4.8   Option C: Whole Facility  \nOption C: Whole Facility, involves use of utility meters, whole-facility meters, or sub-meters to \nassess the energy performance of a total facility. The measurement boundary encompasses \neither the whole facility or a major section. This Option determines the collective savings of all \nECMs applied to the part of the facility monitored by the energy meter. Also, since whole-facility \nmeters are used, savings reported under Option C include the positive or negative effects of any \nnon-ECM changes made in the facility.  \nOption C is intended for projects where expected savings are large compared to the random or \nunexplained energy variations which occur at the whole-facility level. If savings are large \ncompared to the unexplained variations in the baseline-energy data, then identifying savings will \nbe easy. Also the longer the period of savings analysis after ECM installation, the less \nsignificant is the impact of short-term unexplained variations11. Typically savings should exceed \n10% of the baseline energy if you expect to confidently discriminate the savings from the \nbaseline data when the reporting period is shorter than two years.  \nIdentifying facility changes that will require non-routine adjustments is the primary challenge \nassociated with Option C, particularly when savings are monitored for long periods. (See also \nChapter 8.2 on non-routine baseline adjustments.) Therefore, you should perform periodic \ninspections of all equipment and operations in the facility during the reporting period. These \ninspections identify changes in the static factors from baseline conditions. Such inspections may \nbe part of regular monitoring to ensure that the intended operating methods are still being \nfollowed.   \n4.8.1 Option C: Energy Data Issues  \nWhere utility supply is only measured at a central point in a group of facilities, sub-meters are \nneeded at each facility or group of facilities for which individual performance is assessed.  \nSeveral meters may be used to measure the flow of one energy type into a facility. If a meter \nsupplies energy to a system that interacts with other energy systems, directly or indirectly, this \nmeter’s data should be included in the whole-facility savings determination.  \n                                                  \n11 See Appendix B-5.", "tokens": 779, "chars": 4096, "pages": {"start": 124, "end": 125}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0079", "next_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0081", "content_hash": "sha256:895c63c651526a06b7405a82e12759ddaec041c670863b4497b4b38ab98c834b"}

Separately metered outdoor-lighting circuits is one example.   \nDetermine savings separately for each meter or sub-meter serving a facility so that performance \nchanges can be assessed for separately metered parts of the facility. However, where a meter \nmeasures only a small fraction of one energy type’s total use, it may be totaled with the larger \nmeter(s) to reduce data-management tasks. When electrical meters are combined this way, it \nshould be recognized that small consumption meters often do not have demand data associated \nwith them so that the totalized consumption data will no longer provide meaningful load factor \ninformation.  \nIf several different meters are read on separate days, then each meter having a unique billing \nperiod should be separately analyzed. The resultant savings can be combined after analysis of \neach individual meter, if the dates are reported. \nIf any of the energy data are missing from the reporting period, a reporting-period mathematical \nmodel can be created to fill in missing data. However the reported savings for the missing \nperiod should identify these savings as \"missing data.\"  \n4.8.2 Option C: Energy Invoices Issues  \nEnergy data for Option C are often derived from utility meters, either through direct reading of \nthe meter, or from utility invoices. Where utility bills are the source of data, it should be \nrecognized that a utility’s need for regular meter reading is not usually as great as the needs of \nM&V. Utility bills sometimes contain estimated data, especially for small accounts. Sometimes it \ncannot be determined from the bill itself whether the data came from an estimate or an actual \nmeter reading. Unreported estimated meter readings create unknown errors for estimated \nmonth(s) and and also for the subsequent month of the actual meter reading. However the first \ninvoice with an actual reading after one or more estimates will correct the previous errors in \nenergy quantities. Savings reports should note when estimates are part of the utility data.  \nWhen an electrical utility estimates a meter reading, no valid data exist for the electrical demand \nof that period.  \nEnergy may be supplied indirectly to a facility, through on-site storage facilities, such as for oil, \npropane or coal. In these situations, the energy supplier’s shipment invoices do not represent \nthe facility’s actual consumption during the period between shipments. Ideally a meter \ndownstream of the storage facility measures energy use. However where there is no \ndownstream meter, inventory-level adjustments for each invoice period should supplement the \ninvoices.  \n4.8.3 Option C: Independent Variables  \nRegularly changing parameters affecting a facility’s energy use, are called independent \nvariables (see also box in Chapter 4.6.1). Common independent variables are weather, \nproduction volume and occupancy. Weather has many dimensions, but for whole-facility \nanalysis, weather is often just outdoor dry-bulb temperature. Production has many dimensions, \ndepending upon the nature of the industrial process. Production is typically expressed in mass \nunits or volumetric units of each product. Occupancy is defined in many ways, such as hotel-\nroom occupancy, office-building occupancy hours, occupied days (weekdays/weekends), or \nrestaurant-meal sales.", "tokens": 787, "chars": 4029, "pages": {"start": 125, "end": 126}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0080", "next_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0082", "content_hash": "sha256:22fa4ab1a3e0f27b24f35ba4f2c38d2ee58336828dd62db733e19b3fed589d0e"}

Regression \nanalysis and other forms of mathematical modeling can determine the number of independent \nvariables to consider in the baseline data (See Appendix B-2). Parameters, which have a\n\n\n\nIPMVP Framework and Options       27 \n \nsignificant effect on the baseline energy use, should be included in the routine adjustments \nwhen determining savings12 using Equation 1a), b) or c). \nIndependent variables should be measured and recorded at the same time as the energy data. \nFor example, weather data should be recorded daily so they can be totaled to correspond with \nthe exact monthly energy-metering period, which may be different from the calendar month. Use \nof simple monthly mean temperature data for a non-calendar month energy metering period \nintroduces unnecessary error into the analysis.  \n4.8.4 Option C: Calculations and Mathematical Models  \nFor Option C, the routine adjustments term of Equation 1a) is calculated by developing a valid \nmathematical model of each meter’s energy-use pattern. A model may be as simple as an \nordered list of twelve measured monthly energy quantities without any adjustments. However a \nmodel often includes factors derived from regression analysis, which correlate energy to one or \nmore independent variables such as outdoor temperature, degree days, metering period length, \nproduction, occupancy, and/or operating mode. Models can also include a different set of \nregression parameters for each range of conditions, such as summer or winter in buildings with \nseasonal energy-use variations. For example, in schools where the building’s energy use differs \nbetween the school year and the vacation period, you may need separate regression models for \nthe different usage periods (Landman and Haberl 1996a; 1996b).  \nOption C should use complete years (12, 24, or 36 months) of continuous data, during the \nbaseline period, and continuous data during the reporting periods (Fels 1986). Models, which \nuse other numbers of months, (9, 10, 13, or 18 months, for example) can create statistical bias \nby under or over-representing normal modes of operation.   \nMeter data can be hourly, daily or monthly whole-facility data. Hourly data should be combined \ninto daily data to limit the number of independent variables required to produce a reasonable \nbaseline model, without significantly increasing the uncertainty in computed savings \n(Katipamula 1996, Kissock et al. 1992). Variation in the daily data often results from the weekly \ncycle of most facilities.  \nMany mathematical models are appropriate for Option C. To select the one most suited to the \napplication, consider statistical-evaluation indices, such as R2 and t (see Appendix B-2.2)13. \nAppendix B-2.2 or published statistical literature can help you demonstrate the statistical validity \nof your selected model.  \n4.8.5 Option C: Metering \nWhole-facility energy measurements can use the utiltity’s meters.

The accuracy \nof these meters should be considered in the M&V Plan, together with a way of comparing its \nreadings with the utility meter readings. \n4.8.6 Option C: Cost \nOption C’s cost depends on the source of the energy data, and the difficulty of tracking static \nfactors within the measurement boundary to enable non-routine adjustments during the \nreporting period. The utility meter or an existing sub-meter works well if the meter’s data is \nproperly recorded. This choice requires no extra metering cost. \nThe cost of tracking changes in static factors depends on the facility’s size, the likelihood of \nstatic-factor change, the difficulty of detecting changes, and the surveillance procedures already \nin place.  \n4.8.7 Option C: Best Applications  \nOption C is best applied where:  \n \nThe energy performance of the whole facility will be assessed, not just the ECMs.  \n \nThere are many types of ECMs in one facility.  \n \nThe ECMs involve activities whose individual energy use is difficult to separately measure \n(operator training, wall or window upgrades, for example).  \n \nThe savings are large compared to the variance in the baseline data, during the reporting \nperiod (See Appendix B-1.2).  \n \nWhen Retrofit-Isolation techniques (Option A or B) are excessively complex. For example, \nwhen interactive effects or interactions between ECMs are substantial.   \n \nMajor future changes to the facility are not expected during the reporting period.  \n \nA system of tracking static factors can be established to enable possible future non-routine \nadjustments.  \n \nReasonable correlations can be found between energy use and other independent \nvariables.  \n4.9   Option D: Calibrated Simulation  \nOption D, Calibrated Simulation, involves the use of computer simulation software to predict \nfacility energy for one or both of the terms in Equation 1). A simulation model must be \n\"calibrated\" so that it predicts an energy pattern that approximately matches actual metered \ndata.   \nOption D may be used to assess the performance of all ECMs in a facility, akin to Option C. \nHowever, the Option D simulation tool allows you to also estimate the savings attributable to \neach ECM within a multiple-ECM project.  \nOption D may also be used to assess just the performance of individual systems within a facility, \nakin to Options A and B.

Periodic inspections will identify \nchanges from baseline conditions and modeled equipment performance (see also Chapter \n4.7.1. Option A Installation Verification). Simulation runs should be adjusted accordingly.  \nOption D is the primary M&V approach for assessing energy efficiency inclusions in new facility \ndesigns. The IPMVP Volume III Part I, titled “Concepts and Options for Determining Savings In \nNew Construction”, provides guidance on a variety of M&V techniques applicable to new \nbuildings.  \nAccurate computer modeling and calibration to measured energy data are the major challenges \nassociated with Option D. To control the costs of this method while maintaining reasonable \naccuracy, the following points should be considered when using Option D:  \n \nSimulation analysis should be conducted by trained personnel who are experienced with \nboth the software and the calibration techniques.  \n \nInput data should represent the best available information including as much as possible of \navailable actual performance data from key components in the facility \n \nThe simulation inputs need to be adjusted so its results match both the demand and \nconsumption data from monthly utility bills, within acceptable tolerances (i.e. \"calibrated\"). \nClose agreement between predicted and actual annual total energy is usually insufficient \ndemonstration that the simulation adequately predicts the energy behavior of the facility \n(See Chapter 4.9.2). \n \nOption D requires careful documentation.

However \nsimplified HVAC system models may also be used if the building’s heat losses, heat gains, \ninternal loads, and HVAC systems are simple. Other types of special-purpose programs may be \nused to simulate energy use and operation of devices or industrial processes.  \nAny software used must be well documented and well understood by the user. Due to the wide \nvariety of available methods, it is prudent to receive acceptance by the owner or project \nauthority of the proposed modeling program before commencing analysis. \n4.9.2 Option D: Calibration  \nSavings determined with Option D are based on one or more complex estimates of energy use. \nThe accuracy of the savings depends on how well the simulation models actual equipment \nperformance, and how well calibrated it is to metered energy performance.  \nCalibration is achieved by verifying that the simulation model reasonably predicts the energy \npatterns of the facility by comparing model results to a set of calibration data. These calibration \ndata include measured energy data, independent variables and static factor.  \nCalibration of building simulations is usually done with 12 monthly utility bills. These bills should \nbe from a period of stable operation. In a new building, it may take a number of months before \nfull occupancy and before the staff learns the best ways to operate the facility. The calibration \ndata should be documented in the M&V Plan along with a description of its sources.  \nDetailed operating data from the facility help to develop the calibration data. These data might \ninclude operating characteristics, occupancy, weather, loads and equipment efficiency. Some \nvariables may be measured for short intervals (day, week or month) or extracted from existing \noperating logs. The accuracy of meters should be verified for critical measurements. If \nresources permit, building ventilation and infiltration should be measured because these \nquantities often vary widely from expectations. One-time measurements will improve simulation \naccuracy without much additional cost. On/off tests can measure lighting, receptacle loads and \nmotor control centers. These tests can be performed over a weekend using a data logger or \nbuilding automation system to record whole-facility energy use, usually at one-minute intervals, \nSometimes, inexpensive portable loggers, which are synchronized to a common time, are also \neffective for short-term measurement (Benton et al. 1996, Houcek et al. 1993, Soebarto 1996).  \nFollowing collection of as much calibration data as possible, the steps in calibrating the \nsimulation are as listed below.  \n1. Assume other necessary input parameters, and document them.  \n2. Whenever possible, gather actual weather data from the calibration period, especially if \nweather conditions varied significantly from standard-year weather data used in the basic \nsimulations. However, obtaining and preparing actual weather data for use with a simulation \nmay be time-consuming and expensive.

For projects with a physical baseline, the two calibrated \nmodels include one with the ECMs and one without them. For projects with a hypothetical \nbaseline, calibrated models may include the hypothetical baseline and the as-built (reporting \nperiod) conditions, but measured data will only be available for calibration under as-built \nconditions. In either case, both models and measured energy data must be under the same set \nof operating conditions.  \nSavings with Option D can be estimated using two forms of Equation 1), Equations 1f) and \n1g)14. Both forms presume that the calibration ‘error’ equally affects both baseline and reporting \nperiod models.

Advance \nplanning ensures that all data needed for savings determination will be available after \nimplementation of the ECM(s), within an acceptable budget.  \nData from the baseline and details of the ECMs may be lost over time. Therefore record them \nfor future reference in case conditions change or ECMs fail. Documentation should be easy to \nfind and easy to understand by verifiers and others, because years may pass before these data \nare needed.  \nA complete M&V Plan should include discussion of the following 13 topics:  \n1. ECM Intent   Describe the ECM, its intended result, and the operational verification \nprocedures that will be used to verify successful implementation of each ECM. Identify any \nplanned changes to conditions of the baseline, such as unoccupied building temperature \nsettings. \n2. Selected IPMVP Option and Measurement Boundary   Specify which IPMVP Option, \ndefined in Chapters 4.8 – 4.10, will be used to determine savings. This identification should \ninclude the date of publication or the version number and Volume number of the IPMVP \nedition being followed (IPMVP Volume I EVO 10000-1:2012), for example). Identify the \nmeasurement boundary of the savings determination. The boundary may be as narrow as \nthe flow of energy through a pipe or wire, or as broad as the total energy use of one or many \nfacilities. Describe the nature of any interactive effects beyond the measurement boundary \ntogether with their possible effects (see Chapter 4.4).  \n3. Baseline: Period, Energy and Conditions  Document the facility’s baseline conditions and \nenergy data, within the measurement boundary. (In energy performance contracts, baseline \nenergy and baseline conditions may be defined by either the owner or the ESCO, providing \nthe other party is given adequate opportunity to verify them.)  \nAn energy audit used for establishing the objectives of a savings program or terms of an \nenergy performance contract usually provides most if not all of the baseline documentation \nneeded in the M&V Plan. This baseline documentation should include:  \na) Identification of the baseline period (Chapter 4.5.1) \nb) All baseline energy consumption and demand data  \nc) All independent variable data coinciding with the energy data (e.g. production rate, \nambient temperature) \nd) All static factors coinciding with the energy data: \n- Occupancy type, density and periods  \n- Operating conditions for each baseline operating period and season, other than the \nindependent variables. (For example, in an industrial process, baseline operating \nconditions might include product type(s), raw material type, and number of \nproduction shifts per day. In a building baseline operating conditions might include \nlight level, space temperature humidity and ventilation levels. An assessment of \nthermal comfort and/or indoor air quality (IAQ) may also prove useful in cases where \nthe new system performs differently than the old inefficient system.

This period may be as short as an \ninstantaneous measurement during commissioning of an ECM, or as long as the time \nrequired to recover the investment cost of the ECM program (See Chapter 4.5.2).  \n5. Basis for Adjustment   Declare the set of conditions to which all energy measurements will \nbe adjusted. The conditions may be those of the reporting period or some other set of fixed \nconditions.

Identify the person responsible for approving the site-specific M&V Plan, and for making \nsure that the M&V Plan is followed for the duration of the reporting period.  \n2. Develop a complete M&V Plan which: \n \nclearly states the date of publication or the version number of the IPMVP edition and \nVolume being followed, \n \nuses terminology consistent with the definitions in the version of IPMVP cited,  \n \nincludes all information mentioned in the M&V Plan chapter (Chapter 5 of the present \nedition),  \n \nis approved by all parties interested in adherence with IPMVP, and \n \nis consistent with the Principles of M&V shown in Chapter 3. \n \n3.

Each of these issues is discussed in \nthis Chapter.  \n8.1  Applying Energy Prices  \nCost savings15 are determined by applying the appropriate price schedule in the following \nequation: \n \nCost Savings = Cb – Cr \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2) \n \nWhere: \n \nCb = Cost of the baseline energy plus any adjustments16  \nCr = Cost of the reporting period energy plus any adjustments \n \nCosts should be determined by applying the same price schedule in computing both Cb and Cr.  \nWhen the conditions of the reporting period are used as the basis for reporting energy savings \n(i.e. avoided energy use Chapter 4.6.1), the price schedule of the reporting period is normally \nused to compute “avoided cost.”  \nExamples of the application of energy prices are contained in the examples of Appendix A. \n8.1.1 Price Schedules \nThe price schedule should be obtained from the energy supplier. This price schedule should \ninclude all elements that are affected by metered amounts, such as consumption charges, \ndemand charges, transformer credits, power factor, demand ratchets, fuel price adjustments, \nearly payment discounts and taxes.  \nPrice schedules may change at points in time different from meter reading dates. Therefore, Cb \nand Cr in Equation 2) should be computed for periods exactly aligned with price change dates. \nThis alignment may require an estimated allocation of quantities to periods before and after the \nprice change date. The allocation methodology should be the same as that used by the energy \nsupplier. \nThe selected price schedule may be fixed at the date of ECM installation, or changed as prices \nchange. (Increasing prices will shorten the ECM payback period. Decreasing prices will \nlengthen the payback period though total energy costs will drop when prices drop.) Where a \nthird party has invested in an owner’s facility, the price schedule for savings reporting is not \nnormally allowed to drop below that which prevailed at the time of commitment to the \ninvestment. \n                                                  \n15 See Chapter 9 for the definition of “savings.” See also Chapter 4.6 for discussion of the \ndifference between energy savings and avoided energy or normalized savings. The same \ndiscussion applies to the difference between cost savings and cost avoidance or normalized cost \nsavings. \n16 Adjustments are the appropriate ones described in Chapter 4.", "tokens": 594, "chars": 2810, "pages": {"start": 140, "end": 141}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0092", "next_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0094", "content_hash": "sha256:3fbbe3817c8d4617dc940de8f82d527fb8806e939ff9d892e860dc69354ac994"}

The same \ndiscussion applies to the difference between cost savings and cost avoidance or normalized cost \nsavings. \n16 Adjustments are the appropriate ones described in Chapter 4.\n\n\n\n42        Other Common M&V Issues \n \n8.1.2 Marginal Price \nAn alternative procedure for valuing savings involves multiplying energy units saved by the \nmarginal price of energy. Be careful to ensure that the marginal price is valid for the level of \nconsumption and demand of both the baseline and reporting periods.  \nAverage, or blended prices, determined by dividing billed cost by billed consumption, are often \ndifferent from marginal prices. In this situation average prices create inaccurate statements of \ncost savings and should not be used. \n8.1.3 Fuel Switching and Price Schedule Changes \nThe Chapter 8.1 general strategy of applying the same price schedule to baseline and reporting \nperiod energy introduces some special considerations when the ECM creates a change in fuel \ntype or a change in price schedule between the baseline and reporting periods. Such situations \narise, for example, when an ECM includes a change to a lower cost fuel, or shifts the energy \nuse pattern such that the facility qualifies for a different price schedule.  \nIn such situations, use the price schedule of the baseline commodity to determine Cb in \nEquation 2). The price schedule of the reporting-period commodity should be used in \ndetermining Cr. However, both commodity-price schedules would be for the same time period, \nusually the reporting period.  \nFor example, the heating source is changed from electricity to gas, and you intend to use \nreporting period prices. Then Cb would use the reporting period’s electricity-price schedule for all \nelectricity. Cr would use the reporting period’s gas-price schedule, for the new gas load, and the \nreporting period’s electricity-price schedule for any remaining electricity use.  \nHowever, this treatment of an intentional change of price schedule does not apply if the change \nwas not part of the ECM(s) being assessed. For example, if the utility changed its price \nstructures for no reason related to the ECM(s) being assessed, the Chapter 8.1 general \nprinciple of using the same price schedule for Cb and Cr still applies. \n8.2  Baseline Adjustments (Non-Routine) \nConditions, which vary in a predictable fashion and are significant to energy use within the \nmeasurement boundary, are normally included within the mathematical model used for routine \nadjustments, described in Chapter 4.6.  Where unexpected or one-time changes occur in \nconditions within the measurement boundary, which are otherwise static (static factors), non-\nroutine adjustments, also called baseline adjustments, must be made (see also Chapter 4.6).   \nNon-routine adjustments are needed where a change occurs to equipment or operations within \nthe measurement boundary after the baseline period. Such change occurs to a static factor not \nto independent variables. For example, an ECM improved the efficeincy of a large number of \nlight fixtures. When more light fixtures were installed, after ECM installation, a non-routine \nadjustment was made. The estimated energy of the extra fixtures was added to the baseline \nenergy so that the ECM’s true savings were still reported. \nValues estimated for use in IPMVP Option A are usually chosen to eliminate the need for \nadjustments when changes happen within the measurement boundary (see Chapter 4.8.1). \nTherefore non-routine adjustments can be avoided using Option A. For example, a chiller plant’s \ncooling load was estimated rather than measured in order to determine Option A savings \ncreated by a chiller efficiency ECM. After retrofit, a facility addition increased the actual cooling \nload within the measurement boundary. However since Option A was chosen using a fixed \ncooling load, reported savings are unchanged.", "tokens": 804, "chars": 3989, "pages": {"start": 141, "end": 142}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0093", "next_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0095", "content_hash": "sha256:b8f69f84b66ee10d017d83f612bb7ca7d59b09045eafb182e30ef8448f606b89"}

The use of Option A avoided the need for a non-\nroutine adjustment. \nBaseline conditions need to be fully documented in the M&V Plan so that changes in static \nfactors can be identified and proper non-routine adjustments made.  It is important to have a\n\n\n\nOther Common M&V Issues       43 \n \nmethod of tracking and reporting changes in these same static factors. This tracking of \nconditions may be performed by one or more of: the facility owner, the agent creating savings, \nor a third party verifier. It should be established in the M&V Plan who will track and report each \nstatic factor. \nWhere the nature of future changes can be anticipated, methods for making the relevant non-\nroutine adjustments should be included in the M&V Plan. \nNon-routine adjustments are determined from actual or assumed physical changes in \nequipment or operations (static factors). Sometimes it may be difficult to quantify the impact of \nchanges, for example, if they are numerous or not well documented. If the facility's energy \nconsumption record is used to quantify the impact of such changes, the impact of the ECMs on \nthe facilitiy’s energy consumption must first be removed by Option B techniques. Option C \ncannot be used to determine savings when the facilitiy’s energy meter is also used to quantify \nthe impact of changes to static factors. \n8.3  The Role Of Uncertainty (Accuracy) \nThe measurement of any physical quantity includes errors because no measurement instrument \nis 100% accurate. Errors are the differences between observed and true energy use. In a \nsavings-determination process, errors prevent the exact determination of savings. Equation 1) \nusually involves at least two such measurement errors (baseline and reporting period energy), \nand whatever error exists in the computed adjustments. To ensure that the resultant error \n(uncertainty) is acceptable to the users of a savings report, be certain to manage the errors \ninherent in measurement and analysis when developing and implementing the M&V Plan.   \nCharacteristics of a savings determination process which should be carefully reviewed to \nmanage accuracy or uncertainty are: \n \nInstrumentation – measurement equipment errors are due to calibration, inexact \nmeasurement, or improper meter selection installation or operation.   \n \nModeling – the inability to find mathematical forms that fully account for all variations in \nenergy use. Modeling errors can be due to inappropriate functional form, inclusion of \nirrelevant variables, or exclusion of relevant variables. \n \nSampling – use of a sample of the full population of items or events to represent the entire \npopulation introduces error as a result of: the variation in values within the population, or \nbiased sampling. Sampling17 may be done in either a physical sense (i.e., only 2% of the \nlighting fixtures are measured) or a temporal sense (instantaneous measurement only once \nper hour).   \n \nInteractive effects (beyond the measurement boundary) that are not fully included in the \nsavings computation methodology.  \n \nEstimation of parameters using Option A, rather than measurement. You can minimize the \nvariation between the parameter’s estimated value and its true value through careful review \nof the ECM design, careful estimating of the parameter, and careful ECM inspection after \ninstallation.  \nMethods of quantifying, evaluating and reducing some of these uncertainties are discussed in \nthis document’s  Appendix B.

Chapter \n8.5 discusses some issues in establishing the correct level of uncertainty for any ECM or \nproject. Appendix B-1.2 defines how large savings must be, relative to statistical variations in \nbaseline data, for M&V reports to be valid.  \nThe accuracy of any measured value is properly expressed as the range within which we expect \nthe true value to fall, with some level of confidence.  For example, a meter may measure \nconsumption as 5,000 units with a precision of ±100 units, and a confidence of 95%. Such \nstatement means that 95% of the readings of the same true value are expected to be between \n4,900 and 5,100 units.   \nIn a savings determination, it is feasible to quantify many uncertainty factors but usually not all \nof them. Therefore when planning an M&V process, you report both quantifiable uncertainty \nfactors and also qualitative elements of uncertainty. The objective is to recognize and report all \nuncertainty factors, either qualitatively or quantitatively. \nWhen you describe precision within any savings report, report the savings with no more \nsignificant digits than the least number of significant digits in metered quantities, estimates or \nconstants used in the quantification process. See Chapter 8.12. \n8.4  Cost \nThe cost of determining savings depends on many factors such as: \n \nIPMVP Option selected, \n \nthe number of ECMs and the complexity and amount of interaction among them, \n \nnumber of energy flows across the measurement boundary in Options A, B, or D when \napplied to a system only, \n \nlevel of detail and effort associated with establishing baseline conditions needed for the \nOption selected, \n \namount and complexity of the measurement equipment (design, installation, maintenance, \ncalibration, reading, removal), \n \nsample sizes used for metering representative equipment,  \n \namount of engineering required to make and support the estimations used in Options A or \nD, \n \nnumber and complexity of independent variables which are accounted for in mathematical \nmodels, \n \nduration of the reporting period, \n \naccuracy requirements, \n \nsavings report requirements, \n \nprocess of reviewing or verifying reported savings, and \n \nexperience and professional qualifications of the people conducting the savings \ndetermination. \nM&V costs should be appropriate for the size of expected savings, the length of the ECM \npayback period, and the report users’ interests in accuracy, frequency, and the duration of the \nreporting process. Often these costs can be shared with other objectives such as real time \ncontrol, operational feedback, or tenant or departmental sub-billing.

Option A methods \nusually have lower cost and higher uncertainty than Option B methods.   \nSince new measurement equipment is often involved in Options A or B, the cost of maintaining \nthis equipment may make Option C less costly for long reporting periods. However, the costs of \nextra meters for Options A or B may be shared with other objectives of monitoring or cost \nallocation. \nWhen multiple ECMs are installed at one site, it may be less costly to use Options C or D than \nto isolate and measure multiple ECMs with Options A or B. \nAn Option D simulation model is often time-consuming and costly. However, the model may \nhave other uses such as for designing the ECMs themselves or designing a new facility. \nExpect M&V costs to be highest at the beginning of the reporting period. At this stage in a \nproject, measurement processes are being refined, and accurate performance monitoring helps \nto optimize ECM operation. The cost for each savings determination should be in proportion to \nthe expected savings and the variation in savings (see Chapter 8.5).  \nA contractor is often responsible for only certain performance indicators. Other indicators may \nnot have to be measured for contractual purposes, though the facility owner may still wish to \nmeasure all indicators. In this situation, the owner and contractor share the costs of \nmeasurement. \n8.5  Balancing Uncertainty And Cost \nThe acceptable level of uncertainty in a savings report is related to the cost of decreasing \nuncertainty to an appropriate level for the expected amount of  savings.

To improve the precision to ±$7,000 it may be seen as reasonable to increase M&V \nexpenditures up to $10,000/year (10% of the savings), but not $20,000/year (20%).  \nThe acceptable level of uncertainty in a savings-reporting process is often a personal matter, \nwhich depends on the report reader’s desire for rigor. However reducing uncertainty requires \nmore or better operational data. Enhanced operational data enables fine tuning of savings and \nenhancement of other operational variables. More operational information may also help to size \nequipment for plant expansions or for the replacement of old equipment.  \nEnhanced feedback created by M&V may also allow higher payments to be made under an \nenergy performance contract based on measured data rather than deemed values of savings, \nwhich must be conservative.  \nAdditional investments for lower uncertainty should not exceed the expected increase in value. \nThis issue is discussed in more detail by Goldberg (1996b). \nOf course, not all uncertainties can be quantified (see Chapter 8.3). Therefore both quantitative \nand qualitative uncertainty statements should be considered when considering M&V cost \noptions for each project. \nFor each project, site and facility owner, there is an optimal M&V Plan. That optimal M&V Plan \nshould include iterative consideration of the sensitivity of the savings uncertainty and M&V cost \nto each M&V design parameter. Appendix B presents methods of quantifying uncertainty. \nAppendices B-5.1 and B-5.2 present methods of combining several components of uncertainty \nand setting uncertainty criteria or objectives.   \nNot all ECMs should expect to achieve the same level of M&V uncertainty since uncertainty is \nproportional to the complexity of the ECM and the variations in operations during both the \nbaseline period and reporting period. For example, Option A methods may allow the savings \nfrom a simple industrial-plant lighting retrofit to be determined with less uncertainty than the \nsavings from a chiller retrofit, since estimated lighting parameters may have less uncertainty \nthan estimated chiller-plant parameters.  \nIn determining the measurement level and associated costs, the M&V Plan should consider the \namount of variation in the energy use within the measurement boundary. For example, indoor \nlighting may use electricity fairly consistently all year, making it relatively easy to determine \nsavings, while heating and cooling loads change seasonally making savings identification more \ndifficult. Consider the following general guidelines for balancing cost and uncertainty in an M&V \nprocess.18 \n1. Low Energy Variation & Low-Value ECM.  Low-value ECMs cannot typically afford much \nM&V, based on the 10%-of-savings guideline, especially if there is little variation in the \nmeasured energy data.  Such combined situations would tend to favour use of Option A, \nand short reporting periods, for example, in the case of a constant-speed exhaust-fan motor \nthat operates under a constant load according to a well-defined schedule.  \n2.

High Energy Variation & Low-Value ECM.  Low-value ECMs cannot generally afford much \nM&V, as in 1, above. However with a high amount of variation in the energy data, the all-\nparameter measurement techniques of Option B may be needed to achieve the required \nuncertainty. Sampling techniques may be able to reduce Option B costs. Option C may not \nbe suitable based on the general guidance in Chapter 4.9 that savings should exceed 10% \nof a facility’s metered use in order to be measurable.   \n                                                  \n18 Also see FEMP (2002).\n\n\n\nOther Common M&V Issues       47 \n \n3. Low Energy Variation & High-Value ECM.  With low variation in energy use, the level of \nuncertainty is often low, so Option A techniques may be most suitable. However, since you \nexpect high savings, small improvements in precision may have monetary rewards large \nenough to merit more precise metering and data analysis, if you can keep M&V costs \nappropriate relative to the savings. For example, if the savings from an ECM are $1,000,000 \nannually, you may decide to increase the $5,000 annual M&V cost to $20,000, if it increases \nprecision and provides more operational data. Alternatively, a high-value ECM may be \nclearly measurable with Option C. Option C can keep M&V costs low, if simple means are \nused to monitor static factors to detect the need for non-routine adjustments. \n4. High Energy Variation & High-Value ECM.  This situation allows appropriate uncertainty \nreduction through extensive data collection and analysis using Options A, B or D.  However \nsavings are also likely to show in the utility records, so that Option C techniques may be \nused with careful monitoring of static factors to detect the need for non-routine adjustments.  \nThe reporting period may have to span multiple normal cycles of facility operation.   \n8.6  Verification by an Independent Verifier  \nWhere a contractor is hired by a facility owner to make and report energy savings, the owner \nmay need an independent verifier to review the savings reports. This independent verifier \nshould begin by reviewing the M&V Plan during its preparation, to ensure that the savings \nreports will satisfy the owner's expectations for uncertainty.  \nThe independent review could also examine non-routine adjustments. However full review of \nnon-routine adjustments requires good understanding of the facility, its operations and energy \nengineering calculation techniques. The facility owner should provide summaries of changes in \nstatic factors so that the verifier can focus on the engineerign calculations in the non-routine \nadjustments. \nAn energy performance contract requires that both parties believe that the performance \npayments are based on valid information. An independent verifier may be helpful to ensure \nmeasurement validity and to prevent conflicts. If conflicts arise during the reporting period, this \nindependent verifier can help to resolve the conflicts. \nIndependent verifiers are typically engineering consultants with experience and knowledge in \nECMs, M&V and energy performance contracting.

For emission-trading purposes, \nadjusted baselines need to consider whether the ECMs were 'surplus' or 'additional' to \nnormal behavior. ECMs may not be allowed for emisison trading if they are 'business as \nusual' or  simply compliance with existing regulations. Baseline rules are defined by the \nrelevant emission-trading program. For example, where equipment minimum–efficiency \nstandards govern the equipment market, these standards set the baseline for determining \ntradable amounts.  \n \nSegregate energy savings by site, if a project spans a power pool's boundary line, or if \nemission quantities may be outside an air shed of concern. \n \nSegregate fuel savings by fuel or boiler type, if different emission rates apply to each \ncombustion device. \nEach emission-trading system usually has its own rules surrounding emission factors to be \napplied to energy savings. For fuel savings, default emission rates may be given when no \nemission-measuring equipment is in place. For electricity savings, default values may also be \ngiven for the power grid emission rate. Alternatively users may establish their own emisison rate \nfor electricity savings, following recognized principles such as those published as part of the \nGuidelines for Grid-Connected Electricity Projects (WRI 2007).  \n8.8  Minimum Operating Conditions \nAn energy-efficiency program should not affect the use of the facility to which it is applied, \nwithout the agreement of building occupants or industrial process managers.

The M&V Plan should establish a maximum acceptable rate of data loss and how it \nwill be measured. This level should be part of the overall accuracy consideration. The level of \ndata loss may dramatically affect cost. The M&V Plan should also establish a methodology by \nwhich missing or erroneous reporting-period data will be re-created by interpolation for final \nanalysis. In such cases, reporting-period models are needed to interpolate between measured \ndata points so that savings can be calculated for each period.   \nNote that baseline data consist of real facts about energy and independent variables as they \nexisted during the baseline period.

However, the system’s hardware and software must be capable of performing \ncontrol and data gathering simultaneously, without slowing computer processing, consuming \nexcess communication bandwidth, or overfilling storage.  \nSome measured parameters may not be useful for control: electric power metering, for example. \nTrending of small power, lighting and main-feed power consumption may be very useful for \nhigh-quality savings determination and operational feedback, but useless for real-time control. \nControl system software can often perform other functions to assist the tracking of changes to \nstatic factors during the reporting period, such as automatically recording changes in set-points.  \nFacility staff should be properly trained in this use of the system so they can develop their own \ntrending information for diagnosing system problems, providing the system has the capacity for \nextra trending. However where a contractor is responsible for some operations controlled by the \nsystem, security arrangements should ensure that persons can only access functions for which \nthey are competent and authorized. \nThe control-system design and monitoring team may have a direct read-only connection into the \nsystem via a modem link so that it can easily inspect trend data in the team’s office. However \npossible concerns for virus attacks and computer security should be addressed in this situation. \nControl systems can record energy use with their trending capability. However, some systems \nrecord \"change of value\" (COV) events that are not directly used for calculating energy savings \nwithout tracking time intervals between individual COV events (Claridge et al. 1993, Heinemeier \nand Akbari 1993). It is possible to tighten COV limits in order to force the trending towards more \nregular intervals, but this can overload systems that are not designed for such data densities.  \nGreat care should be exercised to: \n \nControl access and/or changes to the sysem trend log from which the energy data are \nextracted. \n \nDevelop post-processing routines for changing any control-system COV data into time-\nseries data for performing an analysis. \n \nGet from the control system supplier:  \no standard traceable calibrations of all sensors it supplies,  \no evidence that proprietary algorithms for counting and/or totaling pulses and units are \naccurate. (Currently, there are no industry standards for performing this analysis (Sparks \net al. 1992)), and \no commitment that there is adequate processing and storage capacity to handle trending \ndata while supporting the system's control functions. \n \n8.12  Significant Digits \nWhen performing any arithmetic calculation, one must consider the inherent accuracy of the \ndata so the result does not presume greater accuracy than is defendable.

(see Chapter 4.6.1). “Cost \navoidance” is the monetary equivalent of “avoided energy use.” Both are commonly called \nsavings. Normalized savings is another type of savings.  \nBaseline Adjustments: The non-routine adjustments (Chapters 4.6 and 8.2) arising during the \nreporting period from changes in any energy governing characteristic of the facility within the \nmeasurement boundary, except the named independent variables used for routine adjustments. \nBaseline Energy: The energy use occurring during the baseline period without adjustments. \nBaseline Period:  The period of time chosen to represent operation of the facility or system \nbefore implementation of an ECM. This period may be as short as the time required for an \ninstantaneous measurement of a constant quantity, or long enough to reflect one full operating \ncycle of a system or facility with variable operations. \nBaseline:  Pertaining to the baseline period. \nConfidence Level: The probability that any measured value will fall within a stated range of \nprecision. See Appendix B-1.1. \nConstant:  A term used to describe a physical parameter which does not change during a \nperiod of interest. Minor variations may be observed in the parameter while still describing it as \nconstant. The magnitude of variations that are deemed to be ‘minor’ must be reported in the \nM&V Plan. \nCommissioning:  A process for achieving, verifying and documenting the performance of \nequipment to meet the operational needs of the facility within the capabilities of the design, and \nto meet the design documentation and the owner's functional criteria, including preparation of \noperating personnel. \nCV(RMSE):  See Appendix B-2.2.2 \nCoefficient of Variance (cv):  See Appendix B-3.1  \nCycle:  The period of time between the start of successive similar operating modes of a facility \nor piece of equipment whose energy use varies in response to operating procedures or \nindependent variables. For example the cycle of most buildings is 12 months, since their energy \nuse responds to outdoor weather which varies on an annual basis. Another example is the \nweekly cycle of an industrial process which operates differently on Sundays than during the rest \nof the week. \nDegree Day: A degree day is measure of the heating or cooling load on a facility created by \noutdoor temperature. When the mean daily outdoor temperature is one degree below a stated \nreference temperature such as 18oC, for one day, it is defined that there is one heating degree \nday. If this temperature difference prevailed for ten days there would be ten heating degree \ndays counted for the total period. If the temperature difference were to be 12 degrees for 10 \ndays, 120 heating degree days would be counted. When the ambient temperature is below the \nreference temperature it is defined that heating degree days are counted.

Many utilities base a portion of their bills on the highest (or \npeak) demand they measure during each billing period. Peak demand value are sometimes \nreferred to as simply “demand.” Electrical demand is normally expressed in kilowatts (kW). The \nsum of monthly billed kW quantities can be expressed in unit of kW-months. See also Demand \nRatchet.  \nDemand Ratchet:  A method utilities use to establish the demand for which they invoice when it \nis different from the demand they meter. Utilities may consider seasonal maximums or \nminimums, power factor, or contract amounts to set the demand on invoices (called “billing \ndemand”).   \nEnergy:  Energy or water use, or demand.  \nEnergy Conservation Measure (ECM):  An activity or set of activities designed to increase the \nenergy efficiency of a facility, system or piece of equipment. ECMs may also conserve energy \nwithout changing efficiency. Several ECM's may be carried out in a facility at one time, each \nwith a different thrust. An ECM may involve one or more of: physical changes to facility \nequipment, revisions to operating and maintenance procedures, software changes, or new \nmeans of training or managing users of the space or operations and maintenance staff. An ECM \nmay be applied as a retrofit to an existing system or facility, or as a modification to a design \nbefore construction of a new system or facility. \nEnergy Performance Contract:  A contract between two or more parties where payment is \nbased on achieving specified results, such as reductions in energy costs or payback of \ninvestment within a stated period. \nEnergy Services Company (ESCO):  A firm which provides services of design and \nconstruction of ECMs under an energy performance contract. \nEstimate:  A process of determining a parameter used in a savings calculation through methods \nother than measuring it in the baseline and reporting periods. These methods may range from \narbitrary assumptions to engineering estimates derived from manufacturer’s rating of equipment \nperformance. Equipment performance tests that are not made in the place where they are used \nduring the reporting period are estimates, for purposes of adherence with IPMVP. \nFacility:  A building or industrial site containing several energy using systems. A wing or section \nof a larger facility can be treated as a facility of its own if it has meters which separately \nmeasure all of its energy.  \nIndependent Variable:  A parameter that is expected to change regularly and have a \nmeasurable impact on the energy use of a system or facility. \nInteractive Effects:  Energy effects created by an ECM but not measured within the \nmeasurement boundary. \nMarginal Price:  The cost of one additional unit of a commodity billed under a complex rate \nschedule. \nMean:  See Appendix B-1.3. \nMean Bias Error (MBE):  See Appendix B-2.2.2. \nMeasurement and Verification (M&V): The process of using measurements to reliably \ndetermine actual savings created within an individual facility by an energy management \nprogram.

When non-routine adjustments are applied to the baseline energy they are \nsometimes called just “baseline adjustments.” (See also Chapter 8.2.) \nNormalized Savings:  The reduction in energy use or cost that occurred in the reporting period, \nrelative to what would have occurred if the facility had been equipped and operated as it was in \nthe baseline period but under a normal set of conditions. These normal conditions may be a \nlong term average, or those of any other chosen period of time, other than the reporting period. \nNormal conditions may also be set as those prevailing during the baseline period, especially if \nthey were used as the basis for predicting savings. (See Chapter 4.6.2) If conditions are those \nof the reporting period, the term avoided energy use (see Chapter 4.6.1), or just savings, is \nused instead of normalized savings. \nOperational Verification: Verification that the ECMs are installed and operating properly and \nhave the potential to generate savings. Operational verification may involve inspections, \nfunctional performance testing, and/or data trending with analysis. \nPrecision:  The amount by which a measured value is expected to deviate from the true value.  \nPrecision is expressed as a “±” tolerance. Any precision statement about a measured value \nshould include a confidence statement. For example a meter’s precision may be rated by the \nmeter manufacturer as ±10% with a 95% confidence level. See Appendices B-1.1 and B-1.2 for \ndefinitions of Absolute Precision and Relative Precision. \nProbable Error:  See Appendix B-5. \nProxy:  A measured parameter substituted in place of direct measurement of an energy \nparameter, where a relationship between the two has been proven on site. For example, if a \nrelationship has been proven between the output signal from a variable speed drive controller \nand the power requirements of the controlled fan, this output signal is a proxy for fan power. \nR Squared (R2):   See Appendix B-2.2.1. \nRegression Analysis:  A mathematical technique that extracts parameters from a set of data to \ndescribe the correlation of measured independent variables and dependent variables (usually \nenergy data). See Appendix B-2. \nReporting Period:  The period of time following implementation of an ECM when savings \nreports adhere to IPMVP. This period may be as short as the time for an instantaneous \nmeasurement of a constant quantity; long enough to reflect all normal operating modes of a \nsystem or facility with variable operations; the length of the financial payback period for an \ninvestment; the duration of a performance measurement period under an energy performance \ncontract; or indefinite.", "tokens": 771, "chars": 3801, "pages": {"start": 156, "end": 157}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0107", "next_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0109", "content_hash": "sha256:58be58a1cdfed0ccae948eca7dc6a5acebb96ec143a2a63ad41e66e6293dc3c3"}

The \nlocal utility offered a partial subsidy to replace the pumps with new high-efficiency pumps and\n\n\n\nAppendix A Examples         69 \n \nmotors. To make the final payment of the subsidy, the utility required short-term demonstration \nof avoided energy use in a form that adheres to IPMVP.  The owner is interested in replacing his \nold pumps and reducing energy costs, so he paid for the balance of the installation costs and \nagreed to provide data to the utility after retrofit.  \nFactors Affecting the M&V Design  Pump electricity metering is by 5 utility owned \nconsumption meters. These meters serve only the 10 pumps. Before implementation of the \nproject it was considered possible that the new pumps might enhance pumping rates at some \nwells, so that pumping hours could be reduced. The owner and the utility recognize that \noperating hours and therefore savings depend upon the growing conditions and rainfall each \nyear. Neither party has control over these energy-governing variables.  \nThe owner sought the lowest possible cost for gathering and reporting information to the utility. \nThe owner hired a contractor to select and install pumps that met his and the utility’s \nspecifications.  \nPump flow is constant when operating because there are no restricting valves and well depth is \nlargely unaffected by the pumping. \nM&V Plan  The M&V Plan was jointly developed by the owner and utility, following a model \nprovided by the utility. IPMVP Volume I, EVO 10000 – 1:2012, Option A was selected to \nminimize M&V costs. The agreed Option A method is to negotiate an estimate of the annual \npump operating hours for a normal year, and multiply that number by measured power \nreductions.  \nIt was agreed that the installation contractor’s measurement equipment would be adequately \naccurate to measure motor wattage requirements. Before removal, the contractor measured the \npower draw of each old motor after it had been running for at least 3 hours. The utility company \nmaintained the right to witness these measurements. Since the pumps are constant-flow, \naverage annual operating hours were derived from the billed electricity kWh consumption of the \npast year divided by the measured kW power draw of the old pump motors. This computation \nshowed that on average the pumps operated for 4,321 hours in the dry year before retrofit. The \nutility found data revealing that total rainfall during that dry season was 9.0% less than normal. \nThe owner and utility therefore agreed that pump operation during that year was 9.0% longer \nthan normal. They agreed that normal hours would be 91.0% of 4,321, or 3,93222 hours per \nyear.  \nResults  The energy savings were determined using IPMVP Option A, Equation 1d) as follows: \n \nTotal load of all pumps before retrofit: \n132 kW \nTotal load of all pumps after retrofit:    \n98.2 kW \nNet load reduction: \n   \n \n \n33.8 kW23 \nEnergy savings: = 34 kW x 3,932 hours/year = 130,000 kWh/year24 \n \nThe utility company’s final payment of its subsidy was based on 130,000 kWh energy savings. \n                                                  \n22 Note this 3,932 number should be expressed with only 3 significant digits, since 91.0% has only 3 significant digits. \nIt should more correctly be expressed as 3.93 x 103.

However common form is used.  \n23 The actual calculated number of 33.8 should be treated as having 2 significant digits. This statement is made \nbecause the subtraction that led to the 33.8 should show no more digits to the right of the decimal than the number \nwith the fewest to its right (132 has none, so 34 has none). \n24 The products of 34 and 3,932 have only 2 significant digits. Though the result is133,688, the proper expression of \ntheir product is 1.3 x 105, or 130,000.\n\n\n\n70        Appendix A Examples \n \nUsing the same estimated operating periods, the owner’s estimated savings under normal \nrainfall conditions and at current utility prices were determined to be 34 kW × 3,932 hr25 x \nR0.2566/kWh = R34,000/year.26 Utility service and network charges were unchanged. \nA-2.1  Pump/Motor Demand Shifting – Option B \nSituation  The irrigation system described in Appendix A-2 above was also eligible for a \nsubstantial utility incentive if the pumps are kept off during the peak periods of 0700-1000 and \n1800-2000 on all weekdays that are not public holidays. The owner installed a radio-signal-\nbased control system to remotely and automatically control the pumps to implement this load \nshifting strategy. The pump control will be reset by the owner annually according to the \nupcoming year’s schedule of public holidays. \nFactors Affecting the M&V Design  The owner believed that curtailing pumping for a \nmaximum of 25 hours per week (15%) would not be critical to his operation in dry seasons. (He \nexpected fewer breakdowns of the new pumps, so there would be no net impact on his dry-\nseason growth.) \nThe utility recognizes that the owner decides whether to shut down the pumps based on his own \nneeds. Therefore the utility required adherence to IPMVP Volume I, EVO 10000 – 1:2012, \nOption B to substantiate each year’s performance, before making the incentive payment.  \nThe owner felt that his financial payback period for the control and monitoring equipment was \nalready long. Therefore he does not want to spend a significant part of the incentive on \nproviding the evidence required by the utility.   \nM&V Plan  The utility and owner agreed that continuous recording of a proxy variable would \ngive the ongoing evidence that the pumps were off during every peak period all year long.  The \nproxy variable is the presence of electricity flow (in excess of the 500mA needed by the control \nequipment) through any of the 5 electrical feeds to the 10 pumps. Small un-calibrated current \nsensors and data loggers were clamped on each power line near the 5 meters. The sensors and \nloggers have a re-chargeable battery-backup power system.  \nThe owner has hired the supplier of the control and monitoring devices to annually read the \ndata, check the clock settings, and give a report to the utility of the dates and times of any \noperation within any weekday peak periods.   \nResults  For the first year after implementation of the control and monitoring system, the \nmonitoring agent reported to the utility that power was used between 1800 hrs and 2000 hrs on \n5 specific weekdays. The utility verified that these days were all public holidays, so there were \nno operations during the defined peak periods.

This project was part of a broader program of the school \nboard to hire a contractor, who would design, install and finance many changes in a number of \nschools. Payments under the contract are based on measured savings at the utility prices \nprevailing at the time of signing the contract. Savings are to be demonstrated, according to an \nIPMVP adherent M&V Plan, immediately after commissioning of the retrofit. Since the owner \ncontrols operation of the lights, the contract specified that the M&V Plan follow IPMVP Volume I, \n                                                  \n25 133,688 is the actual calculated value before significant digit rounding. \n26 This amount can be expressed in no more than 2 significant digits, as from the above observations about the \nminimum number of significant digits. The actual calculated value is R34,103 and should better be expressed as R3.4 \nx 104, though 34,000 is customary currency format.\n\n\n\nAppendix A Examples         71 \n \nEVO 10000 – 1:2012, Option A, using estimated operating hours. The M&V Plan was to be \ndetailed after contract signing. \nFactors Affecting the M&V Design  In developing the M&V Plan the following were \nconsidered:  \n \nAll light fixtures are powered by a common 347-volt supply system dedicated to lighting. This \nsituation makes power measurement simple.  \n \nOperation of lights significantly affects heating energy requirements, so the interactive effect \nneeded to be estimated. \n \nOperation of lights significantly affects mechanical-cooling requirements.  However, since \nvery little of the school is mechanically cooled and that space is usually vacant during the \nwarmer weather, cooling interactive effects were ignored. \n \nSchool-board officials had difficulty accepting an arbitrary assumption of lighting operating \nperiods. They agreed to pay for a carefully instrumented two-month period of logging lighting \npatterns in one school. This test would substantiate the estimated operating hours that \nwould be agreed for all schools. \nM&V Plan  The measurement boundary of this ECM was drawn to include the lighting fixtures \nconnected to the 347-volt supply system.   \n \nThe heating interactive effect was determined by engineering calculations to be a 6.0% \nincrease in boiler-output energy requirements, for the period from November through March. \nBoiler efficiency in winter was estimated to be 79% under typical winter conditions.  \n \nThe static factors recorded for the baseline included a lighting survey giving a description, \nlocation, light level, and count of the number of operating and burned out lamps ballasts and \nfixtures.  \n \n30 lighting loggers were placed in randomly chosen classrooms, corridors, locker rooms, \nand offices and also in the gym and auditorium, for two months.  This period included the \none-week spring holiday and two legal holidays.

Supervisors regularly changed between working on the first \nand second shifts.

Since the \nprimary purpose of the retrofit was to control production area lighting hours, a sampling based \nmethod was developed to measure the change in operating hours. The lighting power (for use in \nEquation 1d)) was estimated from manufacturers’ ratings to be 223 kW.  \nLighting loggers were placed randomly around the production area to record the operating hours \nof randomly chosen lighting zones. The number of loggers was chosen as follows, to obtain an \noverall precision in operating period estimates of ±10%, at 90% confidence. It was expected that \nthe mean operating hours before installation of the occupancy sensors would be 125 hours per \nweek, and that the standard deviation in readings would be 25. Therefore the initially estimated \ncv is 0.20 and the necessary number of samples (with z of 1.96) is 15 (Equation B-16). Since \nthere are only 70 zones, the finite population adjustment lowers the estimated required number \nof loggers to 12 (Equation B-17). It was assumed that after installation of occupancy sensors the \ncv will be much lower so the 12 loggers will be adequate. \nThere are no interactive effects of this retrofit on other building loads because the plant is \nneither heated nor air-conditioned. The reduction in night-time lighting is expected to make the \nbuilding more thermally comfortable at the beginning of the morning shift. \nResults  After a one month period, data was gathered from the loggers and the average weekly \noperating hours computed for the 12 zones. The mean value was 115 and the standard \ndeviation was 29. Therefore the cv was 0.24 ( = 29 / 115 ), higher than the expected value and \nworse than necessary to meet the precision requirement.

In this situation the cv is 0.04 and well within the \nrequired 0.2, so the one-month readings were accepted. No changes had happened to the way \nthe plant was used or occupied, so there is no need to make any non-routine adjustment to the \nbaseline data. \nThe reduction in operating hours was 118 – 82 = 36 hours per week.

A new lighting system was installed on the same wiring, including high-efficiency \nfixtures and a dimming system which curtails lighting power by up to 50% in the quietest hours. \nThe lighting is distributed across the city, with 23 metering points. The retrofit included the \naddition of centralized dimming control. The city retained the current lighting-maintenance \ncontractor to design, install and maintain the system. The city obtained a savings performance \nguarantee from the contractor. The city required the contractor to continuously demonstrate \nachievement of the guaranteed savings. \nFactors Affecting The M&V Design  The baseline light levels were inconsistent because 20% \nof the fixtures were burned out. The city wished to maintain a more uniform light level. Therefore \nit upgraded its public lighting maintenance contract to specify that burnouts be no more than \n3.0% at any time.  \nSince dimming is critical to the savings, continuous recording of energy use is required. The 23 \nutility meters measure energy use continually. However these meters cannot provide the rapid \noperational feedback necessary to avoid significant energy wastage if a dimmer fails or is \naccidentally changed. Consequently an energy recording capability was added to the central \ndimming control system, to remotely record energy use in the city’s central control station. \nBeyond simple energy reporting, the system compares actual hourly energy use on each circuit \nto an expected hourly profile. Variances from this Retail Chain A are used to spot burnouts and failures \nof the dimming system. \nM&V Plan  Baseline electricity on all 23 utility meters for the past year totaled 1,753,000 kWh, \nfrom utility bills.

IPMVP Equation 1b) was used to adjust \nbaseline energy to reporting period conditions. The M&V Plan aimed to minimize extra \nmeasurement costs so a simple three-phase true-rms wattmeter was added to the electrical \nsupply of the motor-control center feeding all equipment in the compressor room. This \nmeasurement boundary encompassed 6 compressors, 3 compressed-air driers, and all other \nminor auxiliary systems in the compressor room. Heat generated within the compressor room is \nnot an interactive effect since it does not affect any other energy uses. Plant staff were \ninstructed to read the meter at the end of each shift (i.e. three times a day) whether the plant \nwas operating or not. The meter was installed three months before leak-management activities \nbegan.  \nThe static factors related to plant design and operations were listed, as a reference for any \nfuture possible non-routine adjustments.  They included the number, capacity and usage \npatterns of all compressed-air-driven equipment, plant production-line speed, and vehicle \nmodels being produced. \nThe baseline period electricity use, for operating and non-operating shifts, were quite different. \nAlso within either kind of shift there were slight variations in energy use.

Recent \nprocess changes had reduced the available steam for the turbine-generator (TG) unit from its \noriginal design level.

The mill recognized that extraction of more energy by the turbine left less steam \nenergy for the process, or required more boiler energy to deliver the same steam to the process. \nThese interactive effects were not part of this analysis for the electrical utility. The utility \nincentive was based purely on increased electricity production. \nM&V Plan  The mill and the utility agreed to use IPMVP Volume I, EVO 10000 – 1:2012, Option \nB to determine the increase in electricity output for a one year period.

The contractor is only \nresponsible for boiler efficiency improvements, not changes in boiler load. The boiler is the only \nequipment in the building using oil. The price of oil to be used for proof of achieving the \nperformance guarantee was €0.70/liter. \nM&V Plan  IPMVP Volume I, EVO 10000 – 1:2012, Option A was chosen to isolate the boiler \nfrom the changes going on in the rest of the building. The measurement boundary was drawn to \ninclude only the boiler, measuring fuel use and net thermal energy delivered to the building. This \nboundary excludes the electricity use of the boiler’s burner and blower. Changes to these \nelectrical interactive effects were regarded as negligible, and not worth inclusion within the \nmeasurement boundary or even separate estimation.  \nThe contractor’s guarantee was stated relative to the usage of the year before submission of its \nproposal. During that period, the facility purchased 241,300 liters of heating oil for the boiler. \nThere was a 2,100 liter increase in oil inventory between the beginning and end of that year. \nTherefore actual consumption was 239,200 liters. The energy load on the boiler will be \ndetermined from this oil-use data, once the efficiency of the old boiler is established. IPMVP \nEquation 1d) will be used with 239,200 liters as the estimate. This estimate has no error, since \nmost of it27 comes from oil shipment data, which is the reference source with no error. \nBoiler efficiency will be the measured parameter in Equation 1d). Efficiency tests were planned \nfor a period of typical winter conditions before removing the old boiler. Winter conditions were \nchosen so that there was sufficient load to assess efficiency under the full range of boiler loads. \nA recently calibrated thermal energy meter was installed by the contractor on the boiler supply \nand return water lines and a calibrated oil meter installed on the fuel supply to the boiler. Both \nthe oil meter and the thermal-energy meter and data logger have manufacturers’ rated \nprecisions of ±2% for the ranges involved in this project.  \nBaseline efficiency tests were conducted over three separate one-week periods when daily \nmean ambient temperatures ranged from -5oC to +5oC.", "tokens": 775, "chars": 3642, "pages": {"start": 177, "end": 178}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0129", "next_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0131", "content_hash": "sha256:3142ac823af709431d3b20d77f3acc2bac7b130b19b50d9c399822e6e827d17b"}

The same \nprocess will be followed for the new boiler. The readings will be logged in the boiler room and \nopen for inspection at any time.

Consideration was given to requiring demonstration of performance for a whole year. \nHowever the contractor pointed out that the extra costs of meter calibration and data analysis \nwould add €3,000 to the fee. The owner decided that a short test period of 3 representative \nweeks would be adequate. The owner also decided to maintain and calibrate the oil and thermal \nenergy meters himself after the contract, and to annually make his own boiler-efficiency \ncalculations. \nResults  Baseline oil and thermal energy data was collected continuously over a five-week \nperiod, until three were found where daily mean ambient temperatures stayed within the \nspecified range -5oC to +5oC. Dividing net thermal energy delivered by oil consumed, the \naverage efficiency readings for the old boiler during the three one-week periods were found to \nbe 65.2%.  \nAfter installation and commissioning of the boiler, the three-week reporting period was again \nfound with an average ambient temperature between -5oC to +5oC. Boiler efficiency test results \naveraged 80.6%.  \nThere were no other changes to the boiler plant between the time of the baseline-period tests \nand reporting-period tests.

The school contained a pool and \ncafeteria.  The school is in use year round, though it closes for a total of 5 weeks a year \nbetween sessions.

Option C was also chosen because many ECMs were involved, some of which could not \nbe directly measured.  \nSince savings are to be reported as “cost avoidance,” i.e. under reporting period conditions, \nEquation 1b) will be used.  \nAn outline of key elements in the M&V Plan is shown below. Details, data and analysis are \nshown on the EVO subscribers’ website (www.evo-world.org). \n \nThe measurement boundary of this savings determination was defined as: \no An electricity account, including demand, serving the main building, \no An auxiliary electrical account, without demand, serving lighting in the field house, \no A natural gas account for the main building. \n \nThe 2005 baseline conditions were recorded, including a strategy for the engineering \ndepartment to easily capture information about future changes.  \n \nThe baseline period’s energy data and weather data were recorded and analyzed by simple \nlinear regression of monthly energy use and energy demand against degree days. Degree-\nday data was with the base temperature, which yielded the best R2 from a number of \nregression analyses performed over a range of plausible base temperatures.  \n \nPreliminary analysis found clear correlations with weather for winter gas use and winter \nelectricity consumption on the main meter. Analysis also showed that there is no significant \nweather correlation with electric demand, summer gas or electricity use. It was decided that \nregression would only be performed on billing periods with more than 50 heating degree \ndays (HDD). It was also decided that for reporting periods with 50 or fewer HDDs, adjusted-\nbaseline values would be derived directly from the corresponding baseline month, adjusted \nsolely for the number of days in the period.  \nThe energy/HDD relationships were derived for the heating season on all three accounts as \nshown in Table A-7-1, along with key regression statistics and coefficients where significant \nrelationships were found.", "tokens": 749, "chars": 3609, "pages": {"start": 179, "end": 180}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0131", "next_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0133", "content_hash": "sha256:6220fabf0ccbcd71e27d43a31dd975037e1c35acc2dfbfcd11967218f3d08d44"}

These \nobservations are logical since the primary use of gas is for building heating. There is also a \nsignificant amount of electric heat in the main building. \nThe field house account showed a poor t-statistic and R2. The building has no installed heating \nbut must be lit longer in months of less daylight, which are also colder months. Monthly \nelectricity use could be expected to follow a reasonably regular annual pattern related to \ndaylight hours and occupancy, not driven by ambient temperature. Therefore the minimal \ncorrelation of this meter with HDD is ignored, and there will be no weather adjustments made to \nit. Instead, each month’s savings report will take its baseline energy from the corresponding \nbaseline month’s consumption, adjusting for the number of days in the reporting period. \nThe main electrical-demand meter showed a poor correlation with the coldest day’s weather. \nTherefore each month’s savings report will take its baseline demand from the corresponding \nbaseline month’s actual demand, without adjustment. \n \nThe long term impact on savings reports of these regression statistics was analyzed. The \nrelative precision in winter savings reports will be less than ±10% for gas and less than \n±20% for the main electricity account. The expected savings will be statistically significant \nfor winter months since they will be more than twice the standard error of the baseline \nformulae (see criterion in Appendix B-1.2).

In order to account for energy use, the energy manager \nrealized she needed to use M&V style techniques to adjust for these significant factors. \nM&V Plan  The energy manager followed IPMVP Volume I, EVO 10000 – 1:2012, Option C, \nsince she needed to explain budget variances in management accounting reports. She always\n\n\n\n82        Appendix A Examples \n \nstated her energy budgets under long-term average weather conditions and the previous year’s \noccupancy.  \nResults  In order to account for budget variances, as soon as a year was complete, the energy \nmanager prepared a regression model of the usage on each utility account, using actual \nweather and occupancy factors for that year. She then took three steps to separately determine \nthe primary effects of weather, occupancy and utility rates: \n \nWeather She inserted normal weather statistics into the most recent year’s models. Using \nactual utility rates for the year, she determined how much the energy (and cost) would have \nbeen if the weather had been normal. (She also noted how much the actual heating and \ncooling degree days varied from normal, and from the previous year, at each location.) \n \nOccupancy She inserted the occupancy factors of the previous year into the most recent \nyear’s models. Using actual utility rates for the recent year, she determined how much the \nenergy (and cost) would have been if the occupancy had been the same as the previous \nyear. (She also noted how much the occupancy had changed from year to year at each \nlocation.) \n \nUtility Rates She applied the previous year’s utility rate to the most recent year’s \nconsumption (and demand) to determine how much of the budget variance was related to \nrate changes for each utility at each location. \nWith the impact of these three known variables defined, the energy manager still needed to \naccount for the remaining variances. So she inserted the recent year’s weather and occupancy \nfactors into the mathematical models of the previous year, and using current utility rates \nreported cost avoidance from the previous year’s pattern. This cost avoidance was then \nanalyzed in relation to changes in static factors recorded for each site relative to the previous \nyear’s record.  All remaining variance was reported as truly random, or unknown phenomena.   \nThis analysis process not only allowed the energy manager to account for budget variances, it \nalso informed her of where to focus efforts to manage unaccounted variances. In addition it \nallowed her to make more informed budgets for subsequent years. \nA-8  Multiple ECMs In A Building Without Energy Meters In The Baseline \nPeriod – Option D  \nSituation  An energy efficiency project was implemented in an American university library \nbuilding, involving seven ECMs spanning lighting, HVAC, operator training and occupant \nawareness campaigns.

The building is part of a multiple-building campus without individual \nbuilding meters. The objectives of the project were to reduce energy costs in the library. \nFactors Affecting The M&V Design  Since the project at the library was very small relative to \nthe entire campus, its effect could not be measured using the main campus utility meters. \nThe university wished to achieve savings as quickly as possible, despite the lack of a baseline \nenergy record.  \nSavings are to be reported continuously, as soon as possible after retrofit, using the then \ncurrent energy contract prices. \nM&V Plan  It was decided not to wait to obtain a year’s worth of energy data from new meters \nbefore implementing the measures.  Instead IPMVP Volume I, EVO 10000 – 1:2012, Option D, \nEquation 1f) would be used, simulating pre-retrofit performance. Therefore, as part of the \nenergy-management program steam, electricity and electric demand meters were installed on \nthe main supply lines to the library.   \nThe measurement boundary of this project was defined as all energy-using systems in the \nlibrary. However the important energy effect was at the main campus utility meters. To\n\n\n\nAppendix A Examples         83 \n \ntransform energy measured at the library to its actual impact on the campus utility bills, the \nfollowing assumptions were made: \n \nA pound of steam at the library requires 1.5 ft3 of natural gas at the campus heating plant’s \ngas meter. There is a fixed component in the gas use of the central plant, arising from the \nstanding losses of the steam system. The 1.5 ft3 factor, an annual average of gas use per \npound of steam produced, allocates a load-based share of this fixed component to the \nlibrary.  \n \nElectricity use at the library requires 3% more electricity at the campus electricity meter \nbecause of estimated campus transformer and distribution losses. \n \nPeak electric demand at the library is assumed to be coincident with the time of peak \ndemand at the campus meter. \nThe expected savings of the ECMs were predicted by computer simulation with the publicly \navailable DOE 2.1 software. A full survey of the building’s systems and occupancy was needed \nto gather all the input data. The power requirements of five variable-air-volume air-handling \nsystems were logged for one week to define some of the input data for this planning simulation. \nThe simulation used long-term normal weather conditions and the occupancy and other building \ncharacteristics that prevailed at the time of the prediction. It was decided to report actual \nsavings under the same conditions.  \nThe university’s gas supply contract has a marginal unit price of US$6.25/mcf.  It also has a \nminimum consumption level, which is only 5,300 mcf below the actual gas usage during the \nbaseline period. If consumption drops by more than 5,300 mcf, the university will pay for the \ncontract minimum amount. The contract will be renegotiated based on the results determined \nfrom this library project. The marginal electricity price at the campus meter is $0.18/kWh in peak \nperiods, $0.05/kWh in off peak periods and demand is priced at $10.25/kW-month. \nFollowing the first year, the first year’s meter data will be used as a baseline for a new Option C \napproach for this building. \nResults  The following steps were used to compute savings. \n1.

The resultant \nsimulation of space temperatures and humidities were examined to ensure they reasonably \nmatched the typical range of indoor conditions during occupied and unoccupied days. \nInitially the simulation result did not match actual energy use very well, so the M&V team \ninvestigated the site further.

In order for savings reports to be \nreliable, they need to have a reasonable level of uncertainty. The uncertainty of a savings report \ncan be managed by controlling random errors and data bias. Random errors are affected by the \nquality of the measurement equipment, the measurement techniques, and the design of the \nsampling procedure. Data bias is affected by the quality of measurement data, assumptions and \nanalysis. Reducing errors usually increases M&V cost so the need for improved uncertainty \nshould be justified by the value of the improved information (see Chapter 8.5). \nEnergy savings computations involve a comparison of measured energy data, and a calculation \nof “adjustments” to convert both measurements to the same set of operating conditions (see \nChapter 4.1, Equation 1). Both the measurements and the adjustments introduce error. Errors \nmay arise for example due to meter inaccuracy, sampling procedures or adjustment procedures. \nThese processes produce statistical “estimates” with reported or expected values, and some \nlevel of variation. In other words, true values are not known, only estimates with some level of \nuncertainty. All physical measurement and statistical analysis is based on estimation of central \ntendencies, such as mean values, and quantification of variations such as range, standard \ndeviation, standard error, and variance.  \nStatistics is the body of mathematical methods that can be applied to data to help make \ndecisions in the face of uncertainty. For example, statistics provide ways of checking results to \nsee if the reported savings are “significant,” i.e. likely to be a real effect of the ECM rather than \nrandom behavior.  \nErrors occur in three ways: modeling, sampling, and measurement:  \n \nModeling.  Errors in mathematical modeling due to inappropriate functional form, inclusion of \nirrelevant variables, exclusion of relevant variables, etc. See Appendix B-2. \n \nSampling.  Sampling error arises when only a portion of the population of actual values is \nmeasured, or a biased sampling approach is used. Representation of only a portion of the \npopulation may occur in either a physical sense (i.e., only 20 of 1,000 light fixtures are \nmetered), or in the time sense (metering occurring for only ten minutes out of every hour). \nSee Appendix B-3. \n \nMeasurement.  Measurement errors arise from the accuracy of sensors, data tracking \nerrors, drift since calibration, imprecise measurements, etc. The magnitude of such errors is \nlargely given by manufacturer's specifications and managed by periodic re-calibration. See \nAppendix B-4, and Chapters 4.8.3 and 8.11. \nThis Appendix gives guidance on quantifying the uncertainties created by these three forms of \nerror. Appendix B-5 discusses methods of combining quantified elements of uncertainty. \nSome sources of error are unknown and unquantifiable. Examples of such sources are poor \nmeter selection or placement, inaccurate estimates in Option A, or mis-estimation of interactive \neffects in Options A or B. Unknown or unquantifiable uncertainties can only be managed by \nfollowing industry best practices. \nAn example of the use of uncertainty analysis is given in Appendix B-6. Also some of the \nexamples in Appendix A present uncertainty calculations: A-3, A-3-2, A-4 and A-7.

Confidence refers to the likelihood \nor probability that the estimated savings will fall within the precision range.31 For example, the \nsavings estimation process may lead to a statement such as: “the best estimate of savings is \n1,000 kWh annually (point estimate) with a 90% probability (confidence) that the true-average \nsavings value falls within ±20% of 1,000.” A graphical presentation of this relationship is shown \nin Figure B-1.   \n600\n700\n800\n900\n1000\n1100\n1200\n1300\n1400\nObserved Values\nNumber of Observed Values\n90% chance that the \ntrue average savings \nfalls between 800 and \n1,200\n \nA statistical precision statement (the ±20% portion) without a confidence level (the 90% portion) \nis meaningless. The M&V process may yield extremely high precision with low confidence. For \nexample, the savings may be stated with a precision of ±1%, but the associated confidence \nlevel may drop from 95% to 35%.   \nB-1.2   Acceptable Uncertainty \nSavings are deemed to be statistically valid if they are large relative to the statistical variations. \nSpecifically, the savings need to be larger than twice the standard error (see definition in \nAppendix B-1.3) of the baseline value. If the variance of the baseline data is excessive, the \nunexplained random behavior in energy use of the facility or system is high, and any single \nsavings determination is unreliable.  \nWhere you cannot meet this criterion, consider using: \n \nmore precise measurement equipment,  \n \nmore independent variables in any mathematical model,  \n \nlarger sample sizes, or  \n \nan IPMVP Option that is less affected by unknown variables.  \n                                                  \n31  Italicized statistical terms in this Appendix are defined in Appendix B-1.3 \n \nFigure B-1 Normally \nDistributed Population", "tokens": 551, "chars": 2404, "pages": {"start": 187, "end": 188}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0140", "next_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0142", "content_hash": "sha256:4f21849a9ffb0e68fae51360e2e221d2fc65dcd60709623610605fd156d9027b"}

Modeling involves finding a mathematical relationship \nbetween dependent and independent variables. The dependent variable, usually energy, is \nmodeled as being governed by one or more independent variable(s) Xi, (also known as \n‘explanatory’ variables). This type of modeling is called regression analysis.  \nIn regression analysis, the model attempts to “explain” the variation in energy resulting from \nvariations in the individual independent variables (Xi). For example, if one of the X’s is \nproduction level, the model would assess whether the variation of energy from its mean is \ncaused by changes in production level. The model quantifies the causation. For example, when \nproduction increases by one unit, energy consumption increases by “b” units, where “b” is called \nthe regression coefficient.   \nThe most common models are linear regressions of the form:  \n \n \n \n \nY = bo + b1X1 + b2X2 + ….. + bpXp + e \n \nwhere: \n \n \nY is the dependent variable, usually in the form of energy use during a specific time period \n(e.g., 30 days, 1 week, 1 day, 1 hour, etc.) \n \nXit (i = 1, 2, 3, … p) represents the ‘p’ independent variables such as weather, production, \noccupancy, metering period length, etc. \n \nbi (i = 0, 1, 2, … p) represents the coefficients derived for each independent variable, and \none fixed coefficient (b0) unrelated to the independent variables \n \ne represents the residual errors that remain unexplained after accounting for the impact of \nthe various independent  variables. Regression analysis finds the set of bi values that \nminimizes the sum of squared residual-error terms (thus regression models are also called \nleast-squares models).   \nAn example of the above model for a building’s energy use is:", "tokens": 802, "chars": 2822, "pages": {"start": 191, "end": 192}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0144", "next_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0146", "content_hash": "sha256:94a4626ba6c2cf9e785e23b3bb13c2b96b4aee888710e6b3c186c5abc30199d3"}

Occupancy is a measure of \npercent occupancy in the building. In this model 342,000 is an estimate of baseload in kWh, 63 \nmeasures the change in consumption for one additional HDD, 103 measures the change in \nconsumption for one additional CDD, and 222 measures the change in consumption per 1% \nchange in occupancy. \nAppendix B-6 presents an example of a regression analysis report for a single independent \nvariable, from common spreadsheet software. \nB-2.1   Modeling Errors \nWhen using regression models, as described above, several types of errors may be introduced \nas listed below. \n1. The model is built on values that are outside the probable range of the variables to be used. \nA mathematical model should only be constructed using reasonable values of the \ndependent and independent variables. \n2. The mathematical model may not include relevant independent variables, introducing the \npossibility of biased relationships (omitted variable bias). \n3. The model may include some variables that are irrelevant. \n4. The model may use inappropriate functional form. \n5. The model may be based on insufficient or unrepresentative data. \nEach of these types of modeling errors is discussed below. \nB-2.1.1   Using Out of Range Data \nIf the model is built on data that are not representative of the normal energy behavior of the \nfacility, then the predictions may not be relied upon. This may include inclusion of outliers, or \nvalues that are well outside the range of reasonableness. Data should be screened before \nbuilding the model. \nB-2.1.2   Omission of Relevant Variables \nIn M&V, regression analysis is used to account for changes in energy use. Most complex \nenergy using systems are affected by innumerable independent variables. Regression models \ncannot hope to include all independent variables. Even if it were possible, the model would be \ntoo complex to be useful and would require excessive data gathering activities. The practical \napproach is to include only independent variable(s) thought to significantly impact energy.  \nOmission of a relevant independent variable may be an important error. The example model in \nAppendix B-2 tries to explain the variations in monthly energy use using several X variables. If a \nrelevant independent variable is missing (e.g., HDD), then the model will fail to account for a \nsignificant portion of the variation in energy. The deficient model will also attribute some of the \nvariation that is due to the missing variable to the variable(s) that are included in the model. The \neffect will be a less accurate model. .  \nThere are no obvious indications of this problem in the standard statistical tests (except maybe \na low R2, see B-2.2.1 below). Experience and knowledge of the engineering of the system \nwhose performance is being measured is most valuable here.  \nThere may be cases where a relationship is known to exist with a variable recorded during the \nbaseline period. However the variable is not included in the model due to lack of budget to \ncontinue to gather the data in the reporting period.

If the irrelevant variable has no \nrelationship (correlation) with the included relevant variables, then it will have minimal impact on \nthe model. However, if the irrelevant variable is correlated with other relevant variables in the \nmodel, it may bias the coefficients of the relevant variables.  \nUse caution in adding more independent variables into a regression analysis just because they \nare available. To judge the relevance of independent variables requires both experience and \nintuition. However, the associated t-statistic (see B-2.2.3 below) is one way of confirming the \nrelevance of particular independent variables included in a model. Experience in energy \nanalysis for the type of facility involved in any M&V program is is necessary to determine the \nrelevance of independent variables. \nB-2.1.4   Functional Form \nIt is possible to model a relationship using the incorrect functional form. For example, a linear \nrelationship might be incorrectly used in modeling an underlying physical relationship that is \nnon-linear. For example, electricity consumption and ambient temperature tend to have a non-\nlinear (often ‘U’ shaped) relationship with outdoor temperature over a one-year period in \nbuildings that are both heated and cooled electrically. (Electricity use is high for both low and \nhigh ambient temperatures, while relatively low in mid seasons.) Modeling this non-linear \nrelationship with a single linear model would introduce unnecessary error. Instead, separate \nlinear models should be derived for each season.  \nIt may also be appropriate to try higher order relationships, e.g., Y = f(X, X2, X3).   \nThe modeler needs to assess different functional forms and select the most appropriate among \nthem using the evaluation measures presented in Appendix B-2.2, below. \nB-2.1.5   Data Shortage \nErrors may also occur from insufficient data either in terms of quantity (i.e., too few data points) \nor time (e.g., using summer months in the model and trying to extrapolate to winter months). \nThe data used in modeling should be representative of the range of operations of the facility. \nThe time period covered by the model needs to include various possible seasons, types of use, \netc. This may call for either extension of the time periods used or increasing sample sizes.  \nB-2.2   Evaluating Regression Models \nIn order to evaluate how well a particular regression model explains the relationship between \nenergy use and independent variable(s), three tests may be performed as described below.  \nAppendix B-6 provides evaluation of an example regression model. \nB-2.2.1   Coefficient of Determination (R2) \nThe first step in assessing the accuracy of a model is to examine the Coefficient of \nDetermination, R2, a measure of the extent to which variations in the dependent variable Y from \nits mean value are explained by the regression model.

An R2 of 0.0 means none of the variation is \nexplained by the model, therefore the model provides no guidance in understanding the \nvariations in Y (i.e., the selected independent variable(s) give no explanation of the causes of \nthe observed variations in Y). On the other hand, an R2 of 1.0 means the model explains 100% \nof the variations in Y, (i.e., the model predicts Y with total certainty, for any given set of values of \nthe independent variable(s)). Neither of these limiting values of R2 is likely with real data.  \nIn general, the greater the coefficient of determination, the better the model describes the \nrelationship of the independent variables and the dependent variable. Though there is no \nuniversal standard for a minimum acceptable R2 value, 0.75 is often considered a reasonable \nindicator of a good causal relationship amongst the energy and independent variables. \nThe R2 test should only be used as an initial check. Models should not be rejected or accepted \nsolely on the basis of R2. Finally, a low R2 is an indication that some relevant variable(s) are not \nincluded, or that the functional form of the model (e.g., linear) is not appropriate. In this situation \nit would be logical to consider additional independent variables or a different functional form.  \nB-2.2.2   Standard Error of the Estimate  \nWhen a model is used to predict an energy value (Y) for given independent variable(s), the \naccuracy of the prediction is measured by the standard error of the estimate (SEY).

If there are two\n\n\n\n98        Appendix B Uncertainty \n \ndifferent types of units in the population, they should be grouped and sampled separately. \nFor example, when designing a sampling program to measure the operating periods of room \nlighting controlled by occupancy sensors, rooms occupied more or less continuously (e.g., \nmultiple person offices) should be separately sampled from those which are only \noccasionally occupied (e.g., meeting rooms). \n2. Determine the desired precision and confidence levels for the estimate (e.g., hours of \nuse) to be reported. Precision refers to the error bound around the true estimate (i.e., ±x% \nrange around the estimate). Higher precision requires larger sample. Confidence refers to \nthe probability that the estimate will fall in the range of precision (i.e., the probability that the \nestimate will indeed fall in the ±x% range defined by the precision statement). Higher \nprobability also requires larger samples. For example, if you want 90% confidence and \n±10% precision, you mean that the range defined for the estimate (±10%) will contain the \ntrue value for the whole group (which is not observed) with a probability of 90%. As an \nexample, in estimating the lighting hours at a facility, it was decided to use sampling \nbecause it was too expensive to measure the operating hours of all lighting circuits. \nMetering a sample of circuits provided an estimate of the true operating hours. To meet a  \n90/10 uncertainty criterion (confidence and precision) the sample size is determined such \nthat, once the operating hours are estimated by sampling, the range of sample estimate \n(±10%) has to have a 90% chance of capturing the true hours of use .  \nThe conventional approach is to design sampling to achieve a 90% confidence level and \n±10% precision. However, the M&V Plan needs to consider the limits created by the budget \n(see Chapter 8.5). Improving precision from say ±20% to ±10% will increase sample size by \n4 times, while improving it to ±2% will increase sample size by 100 times. (This is a result of \nthe sample error being inversely proportional to\nn .) Selecting the appropriate sampling \ncriteria requires balancing accuracy requirements with M&V costs.  \n3. Decide on the level of disaggregation. Establish whether the confidence and precision \nlevel criteria should be applied to the measurement of all components, or to various sub-\ngroups of components. See Appendix B-5.2.

The necessary sample size \ncan be reduced if the entire population being sampled is no more than 20 times the size of \nthe sample. For the initial sample size example, above, (no = 67), if the population (N) from \nwhich it is being sampled is only 200, the population is only 3 times the size of the sample. \nTherefore the “Finite Population Adjustment” can be applied.

Because the initial sample size (no) is determined using an assumed \ncv, it is critical to remember that the actual cv of the population being sampled may be \ndifferent. Therefore a different actual sample size may be needed to meet the precision \ncriterion. If the actual cv turns out to be less than the initial assumption in step 4, the \nrequired sample size will be unnecessarily large to meet the precision goals. If the actual cv \nturns out to be larger than assumed, then the precision goal will not be met unless the \nsample size increases beyond the value computed by Equations B-16 and B-17.  \nAs sampling continues, the mean and standard deviation of the readings should be \ncomputed. The actual cv and required sample size (Equations B-16 and B-17) should be re-\ncomputed. This re-computation may allow early curtailment of the sampling process. It may \nalso lead to a requirement to conduct more sampling than originally planned. To maintain \nM&V costs within budget it may be appropriate to establish a maximum sample size. If this \nmaximum is actually reached after the above re-computations, the savings report(s) should \nnote the actual precision achieved by the sampling.  \nB-4   Metering  \nEnergy quantities and independent variables are often measured as part of an M&V program, \nusing meters.

Monte Carlo analysis allows the assessment of multiple “what if” scenarios \nrevealing a range of possible outcomes, their probability of occurring, and which component has \nthe most effect on the final output. Such analysis identifies where resources need to be \nallocated to control error. \nA simple illustration of “what if” analysis is presented below for a lighting retrofit.

The M&V design challenge is to \ndetermine the impact on reported savings if the measurement of either of these uncertain \nquantities is in error by plausible amounts. \nFigure B2 shows a sensitivity analysis of the savings for the two parameters, old-fixture watts, \nand hours of use. Each is varied by up to 30% and the impact on savings is shown. It can be \nseen that savings are significantly more sensitive to variation in old-fixture wattage than to hours \nof use.

In other words, if the old-fixture \nwattage could be between 91 and 101 watts, the savings could be between 99 and 135 kWh \nannually. The range of uncertainty on the savings is 36 kWh (135 - 99). If the marginal value of \nelectricity is 10 cents per kWh, the uncertainty range is about $3.60 annually. If the wattage of \nthe old fixture could be estimated with greater precision for significantly less than $3.60, then it \nmay be worth enhanced-measurement efforts, depending on the number of years of savings \nbeing considered.  \nFigure B2 shows that the hours-of-use term has less of an impact on final savings in this \nexample (the hours-of-use line is flatter indicating lower sensitivity). It is plausible that the error \nin measurement of operating hours is ±20%, so the energy-savings uncertainty range is also \n±20% or ±23 kWh (= 20% of 117 kWh). The range in savings is about 46 kWh (= 2 x 23 kWh), \nworth $4.60 per year. Again it may be warranted to increase the accuracy in measuring the \nhours of use if it can be done for significantly less than $4.60, depending upon the number of \nyears of savings being considered. \nThe range of possible savings errors from errors in measuring operating hours (46 kWh) is \ngreater than from the error in measuring the old-fixture wattages (36 kWh). This is the opposite \neffect from what might be expected based on the greater sensitivity of savings to wattage than \nto hours of use, as seen in Figure B2. This difference arises because the plausible error of \nmeasuring operating hours (±20%) is much larger than the plausible error of measuring old-\nfixture wattages (±5%).  \nSensitivity analysis such as the above can take many forms.

However, those that can \nbe quantified provide guidance in M&V Planning. By considering the M&V cost of various \noptional approaches to uncertainty, the M&V program can produce the type of information that \nis acceptable to all readers of the savings report, including those who have to pay for the M&V \nreports. Ultimately, any M&V Plan should report the expected level of quantifiable uncertainty \n(see Chapter 5).    \n \nFigure B-2. Example Sensitivity \nAnalysis – Lighting Savings\n\n\n\n104        Appendix B Uncertainty \n \nDetermination of energy savings requires estimating a difference in energy levels, rather than \nsimply measuring the level of energy itself. In general, calculating a difference to suit a Retail Chain A \nrelative precision criterion requires better absolute precision in the component measurements \nthan the absolute precision required of the difference. For example, suppose the average load is \naround 500 kW, and the anticipated savings are around 100 kW. A ±10% error with 90% \nconfidence (“90/10”) criterion can be applied two ways: \n \nIf applied to the load measurements, absolute precision must be 50 kW (10% of 500 kW) at \n90% confidence.  \n \nIf applied to the reported savings, absolute precision in the savings must be 10 kW (10% of \n100 kW) at the same 90% confidence level. To achieve this 10 kW absolute precision in \nreported savings requires component measurement absolute precisions of 7 kW (using \nEquation B-19, if both components are to have the same precision).  \nClearly the application of the 90/10 confidence/precision criterion at the level of the savings \nrequires much more precision in the load measurement than a 90/10 requirement at the level of \nthe load. \nThe precision criterion may be applied not only to energy savings, but also to parameters that \ndetermine savings. For example, suppose the savings amount is the product of the number (N) \nof units, hours (H) of operation, and change (C) in watts:  Savings = N x H x C. The 90/10 \ncriterion could be applied separately to each of these parameters. However, achieving 90/10 \nprecision for each of these parameters separately does not imply that 90/10 is achieved for the \nsavings, which is the parameter of ultimate interest. In fact using Equation B-20, the precision at \n90% confidence would only be ±17%. On the other hand, if the number of units and change in \nwatts are assumed to be known without error, 90/10 precision for hours implies 90/10 precision \nfor savings. \nThe precision standard could be imposed at various levels. The choice of level of \ndisaggregation dramatically affects the M&V design and associated costs. In general, data \ncollection requirements increase if precision requirements are imposed on each component. If \nthe primary goal is to control savings precision for a project as a whole, it is not necessary to \nimpose the same precision requirement on each component.   \nB-6   Example Uncertainty Analysis \nTo illustrate the use of the various statistical tools for uncertainty analysis, Table B-3 shows an \nexample spreadsheet regression model output.

This fact implies a very strong relationship and that the model may be used to \nestimate adjustment terms in the relevant form of Equation 1 in Chapter 4. \nThe estimated coefficient of 7.94 kWh per CDD has a standard error of 0.68. This SE leads to a \nt-statistic (shown as “T stat” in Table B-3) of 11.64. This t-statistic is then compared to the \nappropriate critical t value in Table B-1 (t = 2.2 for 12 data points and 95% confidence). \nBecause 11.64 exceeds 2.2, CDD is a highly significant independent variable. The spreadsheet \nalso shows that the range for the coefficient at the 95% level of confidence is 6.42 to 9.45, and \nimplies a relative precision of ±19% ( = (7.94 - 6.42) / 7.94). In other words, we are 95% \nconfident that each additional CDD increases kWh consumption between 6.42 and 9.45 kWh.   \nThe standard error of the estimate using the regression formula is 367.5. The average CDDs \nper month is 162 (not shown in output). To predict what electric consumption would have been \nunder average cooling conditions, for example, this CDD value is inserted into the regression \nmodel:  \n \n \nPredicted consumption  \n= 5,634 + (7.94 x 162)  \n \n \n \n \n \n= 6,920 kWh per average cooling degree day month \n \nUsing a Table B-1 t-value of 2.2, for 12 data points and a 95% confidence level, the range of \npossible predictions is: \n \n \nRange of predictions = 6,920 ± (2.2 x 367.5) = 6,112 to 7,729 kWh. \n \nThe absolute precision is approximately ±809 kWh ( =  2.2 x 367.5 ) and the relative precision is \n±12% ( =  809 / 6,920 ).

For example, a contractor undertaking to improve the \nefficiency of a chiller plant may simply be required to demonstrate the before and after retrofit \nchiller efficiency, without consideration of the ongoing energy use, which is driven by cooling \nloads that are not the contractor’s responsibility. However if the contractor agrees to reduce \nchiller plant energy use, comparison of before and after chiller plant energy use would be \nrequired. In this latter case Option B (Chapter 4.8.2) would be used if chiller plant energy meters \nare used, or Option C (Chapter 4.9) if whole facility (utility) meters are used to measure total \nbuilding energy performance. \nWhere the energy-performance contract focuses on total facility performance, or where it is \ndifficult to evaluate the effects or several ECMs, Option C would be used. Care should be taken \nto ensure that the M&V Plan (Chapter 5) lists baseline static factors and assigns responsibility \nfor their monitoring throughout the reporting period. However for new construction, Option D \nwould be used (Chapter 4.10 or IPMVP Volume III Part I). Where central metering exists on a \nmultiple building campus and no individual building meters are yet in place, Option D (Chapter \n4.10) can be used, so that the retrofit does not have to be held up to obtain new sub-meter \nbaseline data for a year before planning the retrofit. \nMeasurements may be made throughout the term of the energy-performance contract or for a \ncontract defined test period shortly after retrofit.

This possibility requires good advance recording \nof static factors in the M&V Plan and diligent monitoring of conditions after retrofit (Chapter 8.2). \nThe complexity of the M&V system’s meter design (Chapters 4.8.3 and 8.11) and computations \nshould also consider M&V costs, the expected magnitude of the savings, project economics and \ndesired accuracy of reporting (Chapters 8.3 - 8.5, and Appendix B). \nThe prices used for monetizing the energy/water/demand units saved should be those \nestablished in the contract (Chapter 8.1). \nWhere an energy user feels it does not have the capability to review an M&V Plan or savings \nreport, it may hire a verifier, separate from the energy-performance contractor (Chapter 8.6). \nAppendix A contains examples IPMVP applications to buildings (Sections A-7, A-8, A-9, while \nA-2, A-3 and A-6 relate to technologies found in most buildings). \nD-2   Energy-Performance Contractors and Their Industrial Customers  \nThe primary purpose of M&V for industrial energy-performance contacts is usually to \ndemonstrate the short-term performance of a retrofit project.

The M&V Plan becomes part of the energy performance contract \nterms, and defines the measurements and computations to determine payments or demonstrate \ncompliance with any guaranteed level of performance. \nIndustrial processes often involve complex relationships between energy use and a wider range \nof energy-governing variables than do buildings. In addition to weather, parameters such as \nproduct type, raw material variations, production rate and shift scheduling may be considered. \nUse caution selecting the independent variables to be used (Appendix B-2.1). The analysis \nbecomes very difficult if attempting to identify savings at the main plant energy meters, \nespecially if there is more than one product type being produced in the plant.  \nECM-Isolation Options (Chapter 4.8) help to minimize the complications from production \nvariables that are usually unrelated to terms of the performance contract. Retrofit Isolation \nnarrows the measurement boundary to just those systems whose energy performance can be \neasily compared to production variables. The installation of isolation meters for M&V may also \nprovide helpful feedback for process control.   \nM&V costs may be controlled by considering the responsibilities of all parties to the energy-\nperformance contract. Where some parameters can be estimated with accuracy sufficient for all \nparties, Option A (Chapter 4.8.1) may be most economical. For example, a contractor who \nagrees to increase furnace efficiency may demonstrate the change in furnace energy use at \npeak load after installation of a flue gas heat recovery device. He is not responsible for ongoing \nenergy use of the furnace, which is governed by production parameters beyond his control. \nHowever, if the contractor agrees instead to reduce furnace energy use, retrofitted furnace \nenergy use is compared to the predicted energy requirements of the original furnace over a time \nperiod. In this latter case Option B (Chapter 4.8.2) governs the agreement if a meter measures \nthe furnace’s fuel consumption. Option C (Chapter 4.9) governs the agreement if main plant \nutility meters or departmental sub-meters measure total energy performance of the plant or a \ndepartment within the plant.", "tokens": 813, "chars": 3883, "pages": {"start": 217, "end": 218}, "section": "", "prev_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0170", "next_id": "dataroom_018_chunk_0172", "content_hash": "sha256:6152a776994affa6697d7d7d096ef281bc324c73ac446d5e24e7b21225a62a02"}

When they are confident about achieving the \nplanned savings, a ‘no M&V’ approach leaves the entire budget available for retrofits. However \nenergy users may need to justify investments, add credibility to requests for future investments, \nor quantify uncertain performance. \nM&V design issues would be similar to those described in Chapters 1.4.1. or 1.4.2, above, \nexcept that there is no division of responsibility between energy user and an energy \nperformance contractor. Reporting costs may be lower because of less formal reporting. \nD-4   Facility Managers Accounting For Energy/Water Budget Variances \nTo manage energy costs successfully, a facility manager should understand the relationship \nbetween energy use and facility operating parameters. Important operating parameters include \noccupancy, production rate, and weather. If a facility manager neglects these independent \nvariables, he or she may struggle to explain variances from predicted energy budgets. He/she \nalso risks future budgeting errors.

Both of these cases call for long-term metering. Pay close \nattention to the cost of maintaining and calibrating meters and managing data received from the \nmeters (see Chapter 4.8.3 and 8.12).\n\n\n\n120        Appendix D Users of IPMVP \n \nD-5   New Building Designers  \nNew building investors often wish to compare their performance to what it would have been if \nthey had not included some specific energy efficiency features in the design. The absence of \nreal baseline data normally requires the use of Option D (Chapter 4.10) to develop a baseline. \nThe computer simulation skills needed to properly apply Option D might normally be on the \ndesign team at the time of design. However the critical element of Option D is the calibration of \nthe simulation against data gathered after a one-year period. Therefore it is important to ensure \nthat the simulation skills remain available until calibration is achieved. \nFollowing the first year of steady operation it would be normal to use the actual energy data of \nthe first steady year as a new baseline, switching to using Option C (Chapter 4.9) to determine \nchanges from the first year’s new baseline. \nAll the challenges for new buildings are addressed in more depth in IPMVP Volume III Part I, \nNew Construction, including different methods for special situations. \nD-6   New Building Designers Seeking Recognition for Their Sustainable \nDesigns \nBuilding designers may seek to have their designs recognized under a sustainable design \nprogram.

One way to evaluate a DSM program’s impact is to assess the savings \nmade in randomly chosen end-user facilities. This data can be used to project the results across \nthe entire group of DSM program participants. Use IPMVP Options presented in Chapter 4 to \nassess the savings in the sample facilities.  \nThe evaluation design for any regional program should specify which of the IPMVP Options are \nallowable. It should also specify the minimum required sampling, measurement, and analytical \naccuracies, in order to provide sufficient rigor in program reporting.\n\n\n\nAppendix D Users of IPMVP         121 \n \nUtilities already have the whole facility data for their commodity in their databases, so may apply \nOption C (Chapter 4.9) on all program participants or a sample of them. However without \nadequate knowledge of changes within each facility, a large percentage of variation in the \nsavings should be expected, especially as time elapses between the baseline and reporting \nperiods.  \nEVO is monitoring the needs of the utility program evaluation community. EVO is considering \ndevelopment of special M&V guidance for DSM program evaluation, and for establishing \nbaselines for measuring the ‘demand response’ of customers receiving utility price or \ncurtailment signals (see Preface – EVO’s Future Plans).  \nD-9   Water-Efficiency Project Developers  \nWater-efficiency M&V is analogous to energy-efficiency M&V, so uses similar M&V techniques. \nThe relevant technique for any project depends upon the nature of the change being evaluated, \nand upon the user’s situation as discussed in Chapters 1.4.1 through 1.4.5 and 1.4.8.  \nWater-consuming equipment is often in the control of facility users (building occupants or \nproduction managers). Therefore it can be difficult to monitor user behavior as needed to make \nadjustments to total-facility water use for the application of Option C methods. Retrofit Isolation \nmethods are often more easily applied (Chapter 4.8), using a sample of the retrofits (Appendix \nB-3) to demonstrate the performance of an entire group of changes. \nWhere outdoor water use is being evaluated, the adjustments term in IPMVP Equation 1 \n(Chapter 4) may be related to parameters that drive water use such as rainfall. \nLiquid flow measurements devices (see Chapter 8.11, Table 5) are most commonly applied in \nM&V for water efficiency projects.  \nD-10   Emission Trading Programs \nEnergy-efficiency programs can be central to helping large energy users meet their regulated \nemission allocation.
