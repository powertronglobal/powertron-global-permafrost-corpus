BACKGROUND 
 
The world needs more energy production in the coming years.  The dependence on foreign oil 
and the need to improve efficiency have been national goals for nearly 40 years.  The 
development of additional power generating facilities however has been slow, compared to 
energy demand control.  This is in part because current public service commission rules make 
recovery of costs for large-scale power projects difficult and smaller increments of green power 
are just emerging as cost effective alternatives.   
       
At the same time, the energy sector struggles with improving the efficiency of mechanical parts 
in its efforts to increase power production or decrease power use.  For example, much of the 
potential energy in fossil fuels and coal is lost to heat, making these processes less than 40% 
efficient, which is far better than the 15% efficiency for a car engine, but is still a significant loss 
of potential energy.  Incremental improvements in efficiency at either the customer or power 
generation point yield significant benefits across the grid, especially in peak times. 
 
Because siting and constructing power plants is an arduous and expensive process, many power 
companies have attempted to extend the life of their current power generating facilities by 
offering rebates to customers for energy saving measures like insulation, more efficient 
appliances and HVAC system renovations.  HVAC systems are often the largest users of power 
for homes and businesses, especially in the State of Florida and the rest of the southern United 
States where humidity is a concurrent issue. HVAC may consume 60-80 percent of the power 
used in homes and businesses.  Since HVAC efficiency tends to decrease linearly with time due 
to oil fouling in their heat exchangers. The ability to improve HVAC performance, or to extend 
the life of HVAC system efficiency, would be of benefit both to customers and power generating 
entities. For the customer, the benefits include the potential for reduced maintenance and shorter 
recovery times for their investments. For power suppliers, the benefits include the delay of the 
next increment of power supply.  From a power industry perspective, the more efficient the 
HVAC system,  the more available power there is on the grid for new customers, the lower the 
carbon emissions and the more palatable the options is as a green solution.  
 
Most mechanisms to improve efficiency of HVAC system are mechanical – if the parts work 
more efficiently, the power draw will be less and the ability to perform additional work will be 
displayed as increased capacity (Btuh).  Among the issues in the compressor is the heat buildup 
from mechanical friction.  The mechanical friction will cause a heat loss, which then manifests 
itself as a reduction in efficiency of the unit.  Friction also increases wear on the unit, which 
further reduces the efficiency of the units over time.  If the friction can be reduced, efficiency 
should improve and the life of the equipment should increase.  Demonstrating a means to reduce 
friction is difficult.   
 
Within most conventional HVAC systems there is lubricating oil. The primary use of the oil is to 
lubricate the compressor. As the compressor pushes the refrigerant out, the small amount of oil 
that is there to lubricate will get pushed out with the refrigerant.  Over time the oil is going build 
layer upon layer in the refrigerant lines, just as it does in your car’s engine where oil escapes the 
compression stroke and is combusted.  In HVAC over time the compressor oil is going to escape 
the compressor and coat the heat exchangers. Oil is an insulator and therefore will impede the

heat exchange. When a system is new it is operating at its highest efficiency.  As years go by and 
run time of the system is accumulated, that same initial efficiency is decreased. This decrease is a 
direct result of the oil coating all of the heat exchange surfaces, resulting in longer run times. 
 
The refrigerant lines within the heat exchangers and that connect split systems are metal and 
therefore have a positive charge, while the oil and refrigerant have a negative charge. The oil will 
stick to the refrigerant wall lines and as it breaks down, more will stick, ultimately building up a 
layer of degraded oil on the surface. If there were a compound that could remove the insulating 
oil from these heat exchanger surfaces and improve the ability of the heat exchangers to develop 
a more efficient transfer of energy, the result would be restored BTUH capacity and reduced total 
kWh. 
 
PermaFrost NMR®, covered by US patent numbers 6369006, 6362139, 6286323, and 6276147, 
is purported to be such a product.  The concept behind PermaFrost NMR® is that it has a higher 
negative charge than either the refrigerant or refrigerant oil used by manufacturers in their 
systems. When installed, PermaFrost NMR® penetrates and binds to the metal lattice in the 
refrigerant lines and heat exchange surfaces. Subsequently this action removes the fouled oil, 
which will return back into circulation and ultimately to the compressor oil reservoir where it 
should be. As the PermaFrost NMR® displaces the trapped oil it will restore the ability of the 
heat exchanger to transfer heat energy back to near design specifications. With the restored 
ability of the heat exchanger, the system will be able to produce colder air therefore satisfy the 
thermostat in the conditioned space sooner enabling the unit to run less to perform the same 
work. This is where most of the savings are achieved. 
 
There are several questions about this technology that require answers.  The first question is 
whether there is anything in PermaFrost NMR® that would reduce the refrigerant lubricating oil 
surface bonding, to allow it (the refrigeration oil) to be displaced by the PermaFrost NMR®?  A 
polar molecule would have a higher attraction to the metal and displace the lower charged oil 
molecules. This would mean the system efficiency would improve after PermaFrost NMR™ is 
added.  If there is no surface bonding or displacement of refrigerant oil, then no improvement 
should be seen in the short term. 
 
The second question is whether the PermaFrost NMR® can adversely impact the refrigerant 
flow?  If PermaFrost NMR® does work at the micro level and can replace the trapped 
refrigerant oil, reduce laminar friction and return refrigerant oil from the heat exchangers, it 
would only improve the flow.  If it does not accomplish the above, it would only add to the 
volume of oil in the heat exchangers and possibly reduce refrigerant flow.   
 
An accompanying question about product longevity inside a system have been asked, including 
one of the large utilities that currently provides rebates for PermaFrost NMR®.   An oil analysis 
stamped by a PE shows all of the tests required to satisfactorily provide an answer.  While the 
chemical specifics of these three questions is technically beyond the scope of this review, they 
play into the results included in this reports.  To address these three questions, a lab test showing 
long-term compatibility with metals, groups of refrigerants, and common by products of 
refrigeration, as well as thermo conductivity and friction tests is attached. (Appendix A). The 
conclusion from this review was:

“PermaFrost NMR® will continue to work at the surface as long as there is 
nothing changing internally in a system to deactivate the product. The tests in the 
oil analysis prove that PermaFrost NMR® will not separate under all applicable 
tolerances and will remain active under standard operating conditions.  In addition 
to the actual bonding, chemically the molecular weight of PermaFrost NMR® is 
heavier than oil and water and will not be lifted away due to floating or 
displacement by refrigerant oil, liquid refrigerant or any other lighter fluid.  (As 
an example, in a bowl of water, refrigerant oil will float and PermaFrost NMR® 
will sink to the bottom proving it is heavier than both water and oil.)  The 
combination of surface bonding and molecular weight keep PermaFrost NMR® 
on the metal surfaces preventing the refrigerant oil from reversing the effect.   
Any solution must create a bond to the surface and space lattice and remain in 
place or the product will work itself out of the heat exchangers and the benefits 
will fade quickly.” 
 
The fourth question, and focus of this report, is whether the efficiency can be demonstrated 
under a series of conditions, both in-situ and controlled.  There are protocols for determining 
savings, but from a power supply perspective, less draw on the grid (kW) is desirable.  One 
problem with any technology such as this is that there have been several predecessor products 
that claimed to provide such benefits. The older studies of several additives all showed no 
significant savings, which is one reason why power providers may be reluctant to pursue these 
types of technological options.  
 
 A different research result could open the door to stating that some refrigerant-based surface 
science technologies can produce results that save energy.  Hence, demonstrating the savings in-
situ and in a controlled environment is beneficial.  There is long term data for demonstrating 
performance advantages, but the variables cannot be controlled for these sites.  However, 
because of the chemical nature of the product, if it works in the short term it should also work in 
the long term.  The properties appear to make it less likely to deteriorate than the oil in the 
compressors that may last up to 15-20 years in some sealed systems.  There should be interest 
from the owners and power providers in a thermal surface science technology for HVAC systems 
if measurable operations savings could be achieved.   
 
Therefore the fourth question can be answered if a protocol was developed and a series of HVAC 
systems were tested, both in-situ and under controlled conditions.  The International Performance 
Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) is the widely referenced framework for 
“measuring” energy savings at each site.   IPMVP presents common terminology and defines full 
disclosure, to support rational discussion of measurement and verification issues. A primary 
purpose of IPMVP is to publish current good measurement and verification practice, as 
reassurance for the public about savings reports. Performance contracting industry growth in the 
USA was facilitated by the publication of the IPMVP. 
 
The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and 
Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) 
recognize the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy 
conservation methods and products. There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for 
energy conservation professionals to utilize: options A, B, C and D.

Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is defined as: All 
parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single 
source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the 
ECM (energy conservation method) affected equipment or system and any performance 
enhancements versus the baseline data. Measurement frequency ranges from short term to 
continuous, depending on the expected variations in the savings and the length of the reporting 
period. For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term measurements are useful as data when 
the variables are controlled. The savings are calculated by short-term measurements of baseline 
and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using measurements of proxies of 
energy use. 
 
The testing procedure used here utilizes the "Option B" of that protocol.  Powertron Global's use 
of this protocol under the direct application by a measurement and verification professional 
utilizes enthalpy performance verification to develop a confidence baseline. After the baseline 
has been developed the installation of PermaFrost NMR® was completed as a single ECM.  
 
What to Measure?  
  
Practical standards exist that relate to efficiency and delivery of HVAC systems performance.  
Listed below are the important considerations: 
 
Btu: Btu equals the amount of heat it takes to change the temperature of one pound of water one 
degree Fahrenheit.  The HVAC system is supposed to remove Btus from a building (or put them 
into a building). Each room needs just the right amount in and out, or it’s not comfortable.  A 
more efficient system can provide more Btuh of capacity than a less efficient one.  The goal 
would be to determine if the refrigerant allows the unit to increase Btuh output, which means that 
total operating or run time will decrease accordingly, thereby decreasing total kW hours 
consumed.  
 
Tons:  One ton of nominal cooling equals 12,000 Btu, although this factor should be termed 
“nominal” because no one makes equipment that delivers 12,000.  Under ideal conditions, most 
cooling equipment delivers around 11,700 Btu per ton.   From an efficiency perspective, more 
Btus produced per ton of HVAC system is viewed positively. 
 
Measuring enthalpy to calculate efficiency:  The amount of heat in air is referred to as 
enthalpy. In the US, the enthalpy of air (in the HVAC business) is measured in BTUs per pound 
of air. The enthalpy is directly related to the wet bulb temperature.  Air comprises gasses and 
water / moisture. The gases are mostly nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%). The amount of water / 
moisture in the air is expressed as a relative humidity with typical values of comfort for people 
between 20% and 65%. When heating or cooling air, both the gases (which is called sensible 
heat) and water vapor (which is called latent heat) are affected. A large amount of energy is 
required to heat or cool the water in the air. It is therefore important to know both temperature 
and relative humidity to calculate how much heating or cooling is taking place. It is especially 
important to show a change or improvement to a heating or cooling system. 
 
The enthalpy value yields the amount of heat in a pound of air. To know the total heat removed 
by the evaporator, the rate of flow of air in cubic feet per minute that passes through the 
evaporator. This measurement of heat removal by the air conditioning system is independent of

the ambient temperature outside the building and also independent of the actual temperatures of 
the room itself. 
 
Airflow:  Airflow is required to circulate the Btu’s around. Most equipment requires 400 cu.ft. 
of air through the system in a minute in cooling mode, plus or minus 10%, or 360 to 440 CFM 
per ton of cooling. Below 360 CFM/Ton, the heat transfer through the coil reduces rapidly. The 
airflow through the system is all that really counts. It should match the airflow over the coil, 
minus a few CFM for duct airflow loss, which is an unfortunate reality to some degree in nearly 
every system.  Airflow over the indoor coil should be verified and never ignored. 
 
Static Pressure:  Nearly every installation instruction requires the measurement of total external 
static pressure at startup. This reading is used to plot airflow on the fan tables provided, with 
each system using a fan to verify that the proper amount of airflow is being delivered through the 
system. About 50% of the available equipment out there is rated at 0.50-in. maximum total 
eternal static pressure. Most variable speed fans are rated from 0.90-in. to 1.2-in. available fan 
pressure.  Design practical standards ideally limit pressure drop over the coil to 40% of the rated 
equipment static pressure. Pressure drop over the filter is recommended to remain below 20% of 
the equipment pressure. This leaves 40% of the available pressure for the duct system. The live 
total external static pressure after a system is built is the real test of system performance from a 
pressure perspective. 
 
 
What to Calculate 
 
Calculating Gains in Efficiency:  By measuring the wet bulb temperature before and after the 
evaporator of an air conditioning system, the total heat load (enthalpy) in the air before and after 
the evaporator can be determined. The difference is the heat that is removed by the evaporator 
and therefore the heat that is removed by the air conditioning system. If the heat removed by the 
air conditioning system is calculated before and after treatment with PermaFrost NMR®, the 
change of the system’s efficiency can be accurately quantified. This calculation can be made 
even if the ambient conditions are different when the first measurement is made and the second 
measurement is made.  Calculating the change in enthalpy allows regression using standard 
industry accepted models and therefore is not necessary to attempt to control or replicate the 
various ambient conditions.  The airflow and voltage were measured before and after although it 
is generally it is assumed that the air flow and voltage is constant in the HVAC system.  This is a 
valid assumption under most circumstances but measured for each of these tests. 
 
BTU Delivery:  Total heat removed by a cooling system can be measured. To do so requires a 
very high quality psychrometer that measures wet bulb temperatures with extreme accuracy. It’s 
the wet bulb temperature (the measures of both heat and humidity) that enables us to measure 
total Btu. 
 
The formula that guides this test is timeless. It is simply CFM x Delta-T of the enthalpy derived 
from the entering air wet bulb temperature and the leaving air temperature x 4.5. In other words, 
total BTU equals delivered airflow (CFM) times the change in temperature and moisture content 
of the air through the system (Delta-T of E), times the constant of 4.5.  Taking accurate wet bulb 
readings and converting the values to enthalpy easily and accurately measure the Delta-T of E 
through the system. Subtract the enthalpy readings to find the Delta-T of E.

Sensible heating Btu is measured by CFM x Delta-T x 1.08. To measure heating Btu, multiply 
the measure supply airflow (in CFM) by the temperature change from the average supply register 
temperature to the average return grille temperature, and multiply this total by the formula 
constant of 1.08. 
 
The easiest way to find latent Btu is to subtract delivered sensible Btu from the delivered total 
Btu. A simple formula to find latent Btu is total Btu minus sensible Btu.  The 1.08 is a constant 
in the sensible Btu formula and is based on the air density under standard conditions. This is at 
70F, at sea level, and at 50% relative humidity. That weight is 0.075 lbs./cu ft. times the specific 
heat of standard air of 0.24 Btu/lb., times 60 minutes in an hour. We calculate Btu per hour 
because since we express Btu’s in per-hour units. The total Btu constant of 4.5 is found by 
multiplying the weight of standard air of .075/lb. by 60 minutes in an hour. 
 
System Performance:  NCI’s acceptable standard for delivered Btu in a live system was only 
90% of rated equipment Btu capacity. Ninety percent is a tough standard for heating and cooling 
system performance. Currently, few contractors in the U.S. can achieve this level of performance 
in systems they service and sell.  
 
Instrumentation:  The instruments utilized were certified for this test under NIST standards. 
Identical data was gathered during the pre and post periods utilizing the identical instruments and 
the identical methods.  The following were used in this test: 
 
• CFM was verified by the use of a Fieldpiece Model# STA2 hot wire anemometer 
calibrated to an accuracy of + or - 1%.  
• The wet and dry bulb temperatures were gathered by a Fieldpiece model # SRH3 digital 
psychrometers calibrated to an accuracy of + or - 1%.  
• The refrigerant pressures and temperatures were gathered by a Testo digital analyzer 
model# 550 calibrated to an accuracy of + or - 0.75%.  
• The electrical data comprised of true RMS voltage and amperage averaged across the 
three phases was gathered by a Fluke True RMS digital model 381 instrument calibrated 
to an accuracy of + or - 0.01%. 
 
METHODOLOGY 
 
Task 1 
 
Demonstrating the benefits of chemical alterations to heat exchange surfaces and the effect it has 
on the performance of refrigerants is difficult to demonstrate if not in-situ.  Alternatives include 
conducting a series of tests on steel cylinder bearings or other materials to evaluate stop pressure, 
bearing damage at stop pressure and stop time.  However, developing equipment that will 
eliminate human error in such a process is difficult, and the results do not prove anything 
significant with respect to the performance in the HVAC system.  Instead the best means to 
analyze the performance change it to directly compare results for the same building, and the 
same HVAC system, before and after the refrigerant performance alteration, keeping in mind 
that HVAC system efficiency tends to decrease with time due to oil fouling.  As a result, field-
testing of HVAC units immediately before and after the use of PermaFrost NMR® provides 
some initial insight once other variables are accounted for.  Longer term monitoring is not

preferred, as it may distort the analysis by introducing other variables to the analysis (weather, 
deterioration of the HVAC system, changes in use patterns, ownership changes, etc.). Standard 
testing Protocols used by ASHRAE, ARI and OEMs prefer instantaneous steady state system 
performance data to minimize variable interference. 
 
There are sixty-one (61) separate tests in this analysis.  Four (4) units of the same make, type, 
and size in a controlled laboratory setting and sixty-one (61) field in-situ sites for analysis all 
using the same testing methodology.  The thirty-eight (38) different sites contain different

For any system, there is a need to insure that the HVAC system is operating correctly so that 
changes in equipment do not affect the analysis: low refrigerant, clogged exchangers etc.  A 
checklist for a unit should include: 
 
• Make a note of the condition 
• Inspect hookups at electrical panel to insure no loose connections. 
• Clean or note cleanliness level of coils 
• Measure the dampers if they are not operating correctly (it changes the running time) 
• Measure the outside fan motor amperage to ensure bearing is not going bad and pulling 
more load. 
• Check to make sure there is not a weak capacitor 
 
The protocol was as follows: 
 
• Decide on a site (thirty-eight (38) chosen, some with multiple units at one site) 
• A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the 
unit’s operational conditions were satisfactory.  
• Baseline measurements were recorded  
• The proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected.  
• PermaFrost NMR® was allowed four (4) weeks to embed itself into the metal surfaces  
• Post measurements were taken to establish the efficiency gains 
 
It was recommended that a base line of performance is to be generated after the system is 
running for at least 15 to 20 minutes. This assures that the evaporator and condenser coils have 
reached operating temperature.  After installation of PermaFroat NMR® there may be an initial 
immediate performance change although it takes almost 2-4 weeks for PermaFrost NMR® to 
properly travel throughout the hermetic circuit. The protocol was designed to allow the units to 
run wide open for 12 days (July 26-Aug 6) to expedite the seating of PermaFrost NMR® within 
the sealed refrigerant circuit. 
  
The following parameters were measured on an ongoing basis for each unit: 
 
• Voltage 
• Amperage 
• Suction refrigerant pressure and temperature 
• Discharge refrigerant pressure and temperature 
• Air temperature entering the evaporator DB and WB 
• Air temperature exiting the evaporator DB and WB 
• Air flow (CFM) 
• Evaporator coil pressure drop 
• Total static pressure 
• Refrigerant sub-cooling 
• Refrigerant superheat 
 
The following parameters were characterized before and after the PermaFrost NMR® injection 
(as applicable to HVAC air cooled or water cooled chiller units):

The following parameters were calculated for standard HVAC system site before and after 
PermaFrost NMR® injection: 
 
• kW=Volts * Amps * (1.47 single phase  OR 1.56 for 3-phase ) / 1000 
• Delta T = Return Air DB – Supply Air DB 
• Enthalpy = Return Air WB Deg. F and Supply Air WB Deg. F Converted to Enthalpy 
• Actual Btuh Capacity = Measured CFM X 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta 
• System Efficiency % = Actual Coil Capacity Btuh / Nominal Coil Capacity Btuh 
• EER = Btuh / Watts 
 
For the Chillers, the following were calculated before and after PermaFrost NMR® injection: 
 
• kW=Volts * Amps * .85 * 1.732 / 1000 
• GPM2 = GPM * Measured Pressure Drop (ft) / by Design Pressure Drop (ft) (sqd) 
• Cooling tons/hr = Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU 
• kW per Ton  = Actual kW / Actual Tonnage 
• COP = 12 / kW per ton / 3.412 
• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Water Temp – Saturated Evaporator Temp 
 
Task 2 
 
A draft report of the data developed will be created for review by Powertron Global personnel 
concerning the PermaFrost NMR® product.  Included were the results of the control tests.  
 
Task 3 
 
A final report of the data developed will be created for use with the PermaFrost NMR® product.

of 305 psi. This necessitated another measurement of the pressure drop across the condenser coil

Air Force Airlift Wing Support Center Chiller at Military Base A, MD.  This report contains specific 
information regarding the installation of the energy control measure (ECM) PermaFrost NMR® 
in chiller #3 of the main chiller plant. Detailed forensic performance testing was performed on a 
nominal 170-ton water-cooled chiller using R134A refrigerant serving the 89th Airlift Wing, 
Building 1558 and runs 4,820 hours per year. Following testing, the unit was treated with the 
proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® product formulated for chiller systems. Given 
the 10.9% cooler outside air temperature in the Post, the compressors Amps (70% of the total 
Amps) were adjusted upward by the same amount. This adjustment permeates through to the 
Post kW as well as the kW per Ton. The results were stamped by a P.E.  Characteristics of the

RESULTS 
 
There are two important questions to answer as a part of this evaluation. First, does the product 
appear to provide the benefits suggested by the manufacturer? Second, was the process by which 
data was gathered appear to meet the necessary requirements to demonstrate that benefit?  
 
The data collection protocol for the 49 in-situ DX units and 8 in-situ chillers appears to be in 
conformance with that suggested by the standards.  In-situ before and after results is indicative of 
the initial results thereby eliminating the need to provide corrections.  However these short-term 
comparisons do not necessarily portend long-term results.  A long-term comparison however is 
impossible since all equipment is different and virtually every site has differing use and demand 
characteristics. Initial results appear to be appropriate, although continued periodic modeling 
would be helpful to demonstrate the long-term results. Powertron Global has long term results 
that are available from a major banking institution located in the southern United States.  
 
The four (4) units at the Juno Bach lab test site also followed the suggested protocol with the 
same notes and caveats for the building sites.   
 
The requisite data was gathered and the calculations noted previously were developed.  The 
intent of these efforts is outlined in Table 1.  For example, voltage and amperage must be 
measured so that watts can be calculated.  The changes in voltage should be minimal as the 
electrical system/motors drive the voltage required, however amperage measured affects the 
draw upon the grid.  Higher amperage means more draw.  Since wattage includes both of these 
parameters, higher amperage means higher watts, and therefore more power demand from the 
grid.  The desire is that the additive will decrease demand on the grid.  Likewise the remaining 
factors are summarized.   
 
With respect to the evaluation of whether the technology PermaFrost NMR® works requires 
investigation into whether the goals for the parameters above were met.  Tables 2 and 3 compare 
the results, including all the factors listed in Table 1 for DX units and CHillers.  Tables 4 and 5 
denote whether the goals of the technology (to improve efficiency and reduce draw on the grid) 
are met or not.  In all cases the PermaFrost NMR® met the intent.   
 
Table 2 summary observations: 
 
• Voltage relatively constant 
• Amperage dropped at most sites after PermaFrost NMR® was added.  The overall 
average was a decrease of 7% 
• Air flow was constant 
• Coil Capacity increased at each site that PermaFrost NMR® was installed with an 
average of 29/4%. 
• The COP improved 13.3% 
• Watts per ton decreased at the three standard HVAC system sites by an average of 
20.3%, with a total average, adjusted wattage improvement of 16% 
• Efficiency improved by + 4.9% 
 
Table 3 observations (controlled lab site):

• Voltage relatively constant 
• Amperage dropped in the four units after PermaFrost NMR® is added by an average of 
6% 
• Air flow was constant 
• Coil Capacity increased in each system PermaFrost NMR® with an average of 16%. 
• Enthalpy delta improved in the four standard HVAC systems by an average of 16% 
• Watts per ton decreased in the four standard HVAC systems by an average of 16%, with 
a total average, adjusted wattage improvement of 1% 
• EER delta improved 18% 
• Efficiency improved 16% 
 
While the four (4) test units were tested in July - September, the question is how the in-situ 
Florida examples compare to the in-situ examples, which included installations in Brazil, South 
Africa, Florida, Michigan, Maryland, New York and Connecticut.  The Table 2 and Table 3 sites 
were entered into Table 4 for comparison purposes.  Table 5 shows the chillers.  The findings are 
that similar results were reported with both test conditions despite the differences in location.  In 
all cases efficiency of the units was improved and for most parameters the results were similar.  
Where they differed, the age and size of the in-situ systems suggest greater improvements in 
performance.

CONCLUSIONS 
 
Powertron Global believes they have a system to enhance metal surfaces, which 
improves heat transfer, prevent future fouling, reduce friction, increase component life 
and improve efficiency of the units.  This report evaluates their in-situ test program to 
determine if measurable improvements can be demonstrated.  This would benefit power 
providers if it was verified that the HVAC systems would operate more efficiently and 
reduce draw of power from the grid during peak periods.   
 
There are four questions to answer.  The first question is whether there is anything in 
PermaFrost NMR® that would reduce the refrigerant lubricating oil surface bonding, 
to allow it (the refrigeration oil) to be displaced by the PermaFrost NMR®.  The 
improvements in coil performance certainly suggest that any barrier to heat exchange 
was altered.  If no surface bonding alteration occurs, no improvement should be seen in 
the short term.  Improvements were seen in all systems, so something changed in 
the coils.   
 
The second question is whether the PermaFrost NMR® can adversely impact the 
refrigerant flow.  Stabilizing the metal surface and removal of refrigerant oil from the 
heat exchangers will reduce laminar friction and improve refrigerant flow.  The 
improvements measured at the tests included generally showed significant 
improvement in heat exchange and no adverse impact to refrigerant flow.  The oil 
analysis showing compatibility (no separation of the product) with all relevant 
components in extended tolerances suggest the product should not adversely impact 
flow in normal operating conditions. 
 
An accompanying question about product longevity inside a system has been asked, 
including one of the large utilities that currently provides rebates for PermaFrost 
NMR®.   An oil analysis in Appendix A shows all of the tests required to provide an 
answer.   
 
The focus of this report was the fourth question, whether the efficiency can be 
demonstrated under a series of conditions, both in-situ and controlled, and concurrently 
whether the appropriate data was gathered.  The International Performance 
Measurement and Verification Protocols (IPMVP), Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was 
the option used for this report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American 
Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The 
Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology 
for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and products.  
 
The test protocol for the measuring site parameters before and after PermaFrost 
NMR® addition at in-situ test units appears to be in conformance with the standards set 
for such systems and appropriate efficiency measurements were taken.  It was 
recommended that a baseline for any of these tests allowed the equipment to run for a 
normal on/off cycling for a period of 15 to 20 days to allow for stabilization and steady 
state. Although performance changes may appear immediately, it takes approximately 
2-4 weeks for PermaFrost NMR® to properly travel throughout the hermetic circuit.

The in-situ examples ran for 4 weeks under normal loads.  The four control units were 
run full time for 12 days without cycling off was ample time between the baseline and 
post measurements.  This is an extreme condition unlikely to occur in the field, but will 
mimic extreme in-situ conditions.   
 
The data is best illustrated on three graphs.  Figure 1 compares system 27% increase in 
efficiency afterward.

Figure 2 compares KW draw before (x-axis) and after (y-axis) the PermaFrost NMR® 
addition.  There is a 30% increase in efficiency afterward. The final graph (Figure 3) 
shows the BTU demand before (x-axis) and after (y-axis) the PermaFrost NMR® 
addition.  This figure shows a 35% increase in available BTU capacity in units with the 
PermaFrost NMR® addition.

The data from in-situ and control units verified improvement in the efficiency of the 
systems.  Location is also an issue, but the comparison data for stressed summer 
weather does not show significant variation between sites.  Winter/summer conditions 
may be different, but for Florida, the winter conditions in other states do not often 
apply.  However the in-situ units came from different countries (South Africa, Brazil) 
and states, including a number in Florida, including south Florida, under typical 
summer conditions.  Humidity and elevation may make a difference, but there is not 
enough elevation or humidity difference in Florida to create an issue.   
 
The results appear to be accurate based on the information provided, and data not 
provided or missing was not considered.  The results appear to demonstrate 
improvement in HVAC performance based on the data provided.

Test Descriptions and Results 
 
 
 
 
UL 984A: Testing UL classified lubricant for use with compressor motor insulating materials and 
refrigerants. 
UL has developed specifications to classify lubricant used in sealed motor compressors of air conditioning and 
refrigeration equipment.  The UL program covers lubricants and the indicated refrigerants for all 
insulating materials used in industry-recognized hermetic refrigerant motor-compressors. 
 
 
ASHRAE 86 - 1994: Completed Refrigeration oil floc point, °F. 
 
The temperature in which waxy materials in lubricating oil separate from a mixture of oil and refrigerant, giving a 
cloudy appearance. This test is important in that it evaluates the tendency of refrigeration oils to plug expansion valves 
or capillaries in refrigeration systems. 
Results: - 60°F 
 
 
ASHRAE 99: Completed Refrigeration oil description. 
 
Refrigeration oils can be described as those that operate with certain values of different refrigerants. Separation, 
temperature, and viscosity are a few examples. This test examines these parameters and defines 
oil as refrigerant compatible. 
 
Results: refrigerant compatible 
 
 
ASTM D1500: Completed Color scale 
 
This test is used to compare a range of colors against the colors of other petroleum products. This is the most common 
test, extensively used for industrial and process oils. 
Results: <.05 
 
 
ASTM D3233: Completed Extreme pressure additive. 
 
Lubricant additives that prevent metal surfaces from seizing under conditions of extreme pressure. At the high 
local temperatures associated with metal-to-metal contact, an extreme pressure additive 
combines chemically with the metal to form a film that prevents the welding of opposing aspirates 
(microscopic projections on metal surfaces resulting from normal surface finishing processes) and the 
incidental scoring that is destructive to sliding surfaces under high loads. 
Results: 2400ft/lbs@1 min before failure. Exceeds standards

## Page 54

ASTM D665A: Completed Rust inhibitor. 
 
A type of additive for protecting lubricated metal surfaces against chemical attack by water or other contaminants. 
Polar compounds wet the surface preferentially, protecting it with a film of oil. 
Results: <0.5% 
 
 
ASTM D611: Completed Aniline point, °F. 
 
The lowest temperature at which a specified quantity of aniline (a benzene derivative) is soluble in a specified quantity 
of petroleum product, i.e. the solvent power of a hydrocarbon. The lower aniline point, the greater the solvency. 
Results: 11°F 
 
 
ASTM D877: Completed Dielectric breakdown, kV. 
 
The minimum voltage required to produce an electric arc through an oil sample, hence an indication of the insulating 
 
(arc preventive) properties of an oil. 
 
Results: 41 kV 
 
 
ASTM D93: Completed Flash point, °F. 
 
The lowest temperature at which the vapor of a combustible liquid can be made to ignite momentarily in air. Flash point 
is an important indicator of the fire and explosion hazards associated with petroleum products. 
Results: 370°F 
 
 
ASTM D1744: Completed Water content, PPM. 
 
A method used for obtaining a semi-quantitative estimate of the amount of trace water present in a finished lubricant. 
 
Results: 10 PPM 
 
 
ASTM D445: Completed Viscosity @ 100°F. 
 
This test measures the fluid's resistance to flow. Liquids change viscosity with temperature, becoming less viscous when 
heated. High pressures, or load, tend to squeeze the oil out of the bearing, which calls for the greater film strength of a 
high-viscosity oil. 
Results: 7.8 
 
 
ASTM D97: Completed Pour point, °F. 
 
The lowest temperature at which oil is observed to flow, when cooled under conditions as defined by ASTM D97. The 
pour point is 5°F above the temperature at which the oil in a test vessel shows no movement 
when the container is held horizontally for five seconds. 
 
Results: -70°F.

ASTM D1287: Completed Test for pH. 
 
Measures the acidity or alkalinity of an aqueous solution. The pH scale ranges from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline), 
with a pH of 7 indicating a neutral solution equivalent to the pH of distilled water. 
Results: 6.18 
 
 
ASTM D2717: Completed Thermal conductivity. 
 
Measures the ability to conduct heat. The higher the conductivity, the quicker molecules transfer heat under high 
temperatures. 
Results: Refrigerant oil only - 0.94; with PermaFrost - 1.18 
 
 
ASTM D1384: Completed Corrosion test. 
 
The chemical attack on metal or other solid contaminants in a lubricant. Common corrosive contaminants are (1) water, 
which causes rust, and (2) acids, which may form as oxidation products in deteriorating oil. 
Results: -3 to -5 
 
 
ASTM D4052, D70: Completed API gravity @ 60°F. 
 
Higher API gravity values translate into lower material density, which would mean a lower specific gravity.

ARI Modified 210/240: Testing Unitary air conditioning and air source heat pump equipment. 
 
This standard is intended for the guidance of the industry, including manufacturers, engineers, installers, contractors, 
and users. All procedures are defined by ARI and run under ARI supervision. The tests are independently monitored by 
ARI field engineers. Because ARI Standard 210 required constant load and humidity control, ARI modified the test to 
measure heat transfer at the test site and actual location for 
the HVAC systems. 
 
 
ARI Modified 550: Testing Water chilling packages using the vapor compression cycle. 
 
This standard is intended for the guidance of the industry, including manufacturers, engineers, installers, contractors, 
and users. The standard applies to all vapor compression refrigeration water chilling 
packages including one or more hermetic or open drive compressors (centrifugal, rotary, screw, scroll, reciprocating, or 
other types), equipped with either water-cooled, air-cooled, evaporative cooled 
condensers, or supplied without a condenser.

January 2012 
Dear Readers, 
 
As the world is coming to recognize that energy efficiency is foundational to good environmental 
management, the importance of proper savings documentation has never been greater. It is 
certainly in everyone’s interest that predicted savings are achieved and properly reported. 
Notably: 
 
energy users need to have robust methods of verifying achievement of their energy policy 
objectives, to get or maintain ISO 50001 certification for their management practices; 
 
potential purchasers of energy efficiency products or services want to know that their 
potential purchases have already proven themselves using widely recognized methods; 
 
actual purchasers of energy efficiency products or services need feedback on the 
effectiveness of their purchases, to help them fine tune performance and to inform further 
purchases; 
 
governments and utilities need to know that savings reported from energy efficiency 
programs are grounded in actual field-measured results following a widely accepted 
protocol. 
Basically, the knowledge that energy savings can be transparently reported is vital to the 
acceptance of energy efficiency proposals.  
 
EVO is the only organization dedicated to provision of tools for this purpose. This IPMVP, now 
in its seventh edition, defines transparency in savings reports, while assembling best 
practice from around the world. EVO also publishes the IEEFP (International Energy Efficiency 
Financing Protocol) to help energy efficiency investors indentify and invest in well managed 
energy cost saving projects. 
 
IPMVP’s flexible framework of M&V Options allows practitioners to craft the right M&V Plan for 
their building or industrial facility, inspiring confidence in those who wish to harvest their 
financial and/or environmental benefits. Clear definition of terms, and heavy emphasis on 
consistent and transparent methods are the core precepts of the IPMVP. Though application 
details are unique to each project, IPMVP’s flexible framework has been successfully applied to 
all types of energy efficiency techniques, for thousands of projects and programs, large and 
small, around the world.  
 
IPMVP is the work of numerous volunteers and sponsors, listed herein and in previous editions. 
I would like to thank all those shown in the Acknowledgments section herein. You can join this 
truly unique group of professionals by submitting comments, joining an EVO committee, or 
supporting the movement by subscribing to EVO. I encourage all readers to provide feedback, 
so we can continuously improve the IPMVP (email to: ipmvprev@evo-world.org).

PREFACE 
Outline Of This Document 
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) Volume I is a 
guidance document describing common practice in measuring, computing and reporting savings 
achieved by energy or water efficiency projects at end user facilities. The IPMVP presents a 
framework and four measurement and verification (M&V) Options for transparently, reliably and 
consistently reporting a project’s saving. M&V activities include site surveys, metering of energy 
or water flow(s), monitoring of independent variable(s), calculation, and reporting. When 
adhering to IPMVP’s recommendations, these M&V activities can produce verifiable savings 
reports. 
The IPMVP is intended to be used by professionals as a basis for preparing savings reports. 
Each user must establish its own specific M&V Plan that addresses the unique characteristics of 
the project. The IPMVP is not a standard and thus there is no formal compliance mechanism for 
this document. Adherence with the IPMVP requires preparation of a project specific M&V Plan 
that is consistent with IPMVP terminology. It must name the IPMVP Option(s) to be used, 
metering monitoring and analysis methods to be used, quality assurance procedures to be 
followed, and person(s) responsible for the M&V. 
IPMVP Volume I Chapters are organized as follows: 
1. Introduces IPMVP and EVO.  
2. Defines M&V, and lists eight uses for M&V techniques.  
3. Lays the foundation of M&V by defining the underlying Principles of good M&V. The 
balance of the document summarizes common industry methods for implementing these 
fundamental Principles. 
4. Defines the IPMVP Framework and its four Options. It presents the basic methodologies 
and adjustments to energy or water measurements needed to properly report savings. 
Tables 2 and 4, and Figure 4 summarize the Options and offer guidance in choosing 
amongst them for each application. 
5. Lists the topics that should be contained in an M&V Plan and gives guidance on design 
decisions needed to make the M&V activity cost effective for all users of the savings 
reports. 
6. Defines a means of specifying the use of IPMVP and of claiming adherence with it. 
7. Presents key information that should be included in each savings report. 
8. Lists many additional issues that commonly arise in M&V design or reporting. 
9. Lists definitions of all italicized words in the document.  
10. Provides a list of references and some useful other resources. 
Appendix A provides 12 example applications of IPMVP, in varying levels of detail. It refers to 
EVO’s website for detailed examples of M&V Plans and Savings Reports. 
Appendix B summarizes basic uncertainty quantification techniques to guide decisions about 
the level of rigour suitable for each M&V process.  
Appendix C contains region-specific materials for the United States of America, France, Spain 
(incl. Catalonia), Romania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Poland. 
Appendix D is a Users Guide to help different types of readers understand common ways of 
applying the document

Efficiency Valuation Organization and IPMVP 
This International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) is sponsored by 
the Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO), a non-profit private corporation. EVO envisions a 
global marketplace that correctly values the efficient use of natural resources and utilizes end-
use efficiency as a viable alternative to new energy supply. EVO’s mission is to develop and 
promote standardized methods to quantify and manage the risks and benefits associated with 
business transactions on end-use energy efficiency, renewable energy, and water efficiency. 
EVO is a subscriber-based organization with supporters around the world.  
EVO is grateful to its volunteers who develop and maintain EVO documents. Members of our 
current Board and Committees active in developing this document appear in the 
Acknowledgements section, above, along with Organizational Subscribers.  
EVO maintains a website (www.evo-world.org) which contains: 
 
A subscribers’ section with access to pre-release copies of some EVO documents, 
reference materials, newsletters, discussion forums, and links to other resources; 
 
Latest released editions of the documents, and archival editions; 
 
Lists of the current committee members and supporters;  
 
Invitation for comments on IPMVP documents to the email address of: ipmvprev@evo-
world.org ; 
 
Information on EVO’s training and certification programs;    
EVO documents should include unique methods from around the world. Therefore, EVO is 
developing international, regional groups to document international M&V methods. To 
participate as a volunteer or subscriber, please visit the EVO website, www.evo-world.org, for 
current contact information. 
EVO’s current activities and plans are summarized below.   
EVO’s Current Publications 
Currently EVO has four publications available on its website: 
IPMVP Volume I  Concepts and Options for Determining Energy and Water Savings 
Volume I defines terminology and suggests good practices for documenting the effectiveness of 
energy or water efficiency projects that are implemented in buildings and industrial facilities.  
These terms and practices help managers to prepare M&V Plans, which specify how savings 
will be measured for each project. The successful M&V Plan enables verification by requiring 
transparent reports of actual project performance. 
IPMVP Volume II  Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) Issues 
Volume II reviews IEQ issues as they may be influenced by an energy efficiency project. It 
highlights good project design and implementation practices for maintaining acceptable indoor 
conditions under an energy efficiency project. It advises on means of measuring IEQ 
parameters to substantiate whether indoor conditions have changed from the conditions of the 
baseline when determining savings. Volume II has been archived, and remains available in the 
archives section of the public library on EVO’s website. 
IPMVP Volume III   Applications 
Volume III contains specific application guidance manuals for Volume I. The two current 
applications manuals address new building construction (Part I) and renewable energy additions

to exisiting facilities (Part II). This volume is expected to be an area of continued development 
as more specific applications are defined. 
International Energy Efficiency Financing Protocol (IEEFP) 
The IEEFP provides guidelines for local financing institutions around the world to evaluate and 
finance energy efficiency and savings-based renewable projects.  
History Of Previous Editions  
The first edition of IPMVP, entitled the North American Energy Measurement and Verification 
Protocol, was published in March 1996.  It was modified in December 1997 then renamed the 
International Performance Measurment and Verification Protocol. Options A and B were 
changed substantially when IPMVP was re-published in 2001 and minor editorial changes were 
added in a 2002 edition. Volume II on Indoor Environmental Quality was published in 2002. 
Committees, sponsored by the United States’ Department of Energy (DOE) wrote and edited 
these documents. 
In 2002, IPMVP Inc. was incorporated as an independent non-profit corporation in order to 
include the international community and relieve the U.S. Department of Energy of its 
responsibilities as the organizer.  IPMVP Inc. raised its own funds, created a website, and 
published the new Volume III Parts on New Construction and Renewables. In 2004, IPMVP Inc. 
was renamed Efficiency Valuation Organization as it expanded its focus.   
In 2007, EVO updated IPMVP Volume I primarily for clarity, thought re-writing the uncertainty 
Appendix B. No substantive changes were made to the core concepts, though the titles of 
Options A & B were expanded along with their descriptive materials, to ensure proper 
understanding. In 2009, Volume I was modified to separate USA-specific references and to 
establish a structure for many region-specific materials in a new Appendix C for the USA and 
France. . In 2010, Volume I was modified to add more European references and Appendices, 
and updated the significant digitis presentation. 
Training And Certification 
EVO recognizes that documents alone will not improve the valuation of energy efficiency in the 
world. Therefore EVO and its world wide partners introduced awareness and training programs 
about measurement and verification. These programs educate professionals on methods and 
recent developments in M&V. 
EVO also has a Certified Measurement and Verification Professional (CVMP) program for  
professionals who pass a test demonstrating their knowledge of IPMVP and have appropriate 
knowledge experience or training. CMVP®s should be competent to develop M&V Plans and to 
manage M&V programs for straightforward applications. For more information on the CMVP® 
program, and for the names of designated CMVP®s, visit www.evo-world.org . 
EVO’s Future Plans 
EVO’s subscribers, and volunteers determine its future plans to create new educational efforts 
and documents about efficiency valuation. EVO welcomes IPMVP readers to become EVO 
subscribers, provide recommendations, and participate in new and existing EVO activities.   
In light of its international focus, EVO is in the process of: 
 
Developing active regional affiliates who contribute to the development and maintenance of 
EVO publications;  
 
Conducting additional training and certification programs around the world; 
 
Preparing its latest documents in a variety of languages; and

Introduction to IPMVP       1 
 
CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION TO IPMVP 
1.1   Purpose And Scope Of IPMVP 
Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) publishes the International Performance Measurement 
and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) to increase investment in energy and water efficiency, 
demand management and renewable energy projects around the world.  
The IPMVP promotes efficiency investments by the following activities.  
 
IPMVP documents common terms and methods to evaluate performance of efficiency 
projects for buyers, sellers and financiers. Some of these terms and methods may be used 
in project agreements, though IPMVP does not offer contractual language. 
 
IPMVP provides methods, with different levels of cost and accuracy, for determining 
savings1 either for the whole facility or for individual energy conservation measures (ECM)2; 
 
IPMVP specifies the contents of a Measurement and Verification Plan (M&V Plan). This 
M&V Plan adheres to widely accepted fundamental principles of M&V and should produce 
verifiable savings reports. An M&V Plan must be developed for each project by a qualified 
professional3. 
 
IPMVP applies to a wide variety of facilities including existing and new buildings and 
industrial processes. Chapter 1.4, User’s Guide, summarizes how different readers might 
use IPMVP. 
IPMVP Volume I defines M&V in Chapter 2, presents the fundamental principles of M&V in 
Chapter 3, and describes a framework for a detailed M&V Plan in Chapter 4. The details of an 
M&V Plan and savings report are listed in Chapters 5 and 6, respectively. The requirements for 
specifying use of IPMVP or claiming adherence with IPMVP are shown in Chapter 7. Volume I 
also contains a summary of common M&V design issues, Chapter 8, and lists other M&V 
resources. Twelve example projects are described in Appendix A and basic uncertainty analysis

 
Substantiation of payments for performance. Where financial payments are based on 
demonstrated energy or water savings, adherenece to IPMVP ensures that savings follow 
good practice. An IPMVP-adherent savings report allows a customer, an energy user or a 
utility, to readily accept reported performance. Energy service companies (ESCOs) whose 
invoices are supported by IPMVP-adherent savings reports, usually receive prompt 
payments. 
 
Lower transaction costs in an energy performance contract. Specification of IPMVP as the 
basis for designing a project’s M&V can simplify the negotiations for an energy performance 
contract. 
 
International credibility for energy savings reports, thereby increasing the value to a buyer of 
the associated energy savings. 
 
Enhanced rating under programs to encourage or label sustainably designed and/ or 
operated facilities. 
 
Help national and industry organizations promote and achieve resource efficiency and 
environmental objectives. The IPMVP is widely adopted by national and regional 
government agencies and by industry organizations to help manage their programs and 
enhance the credibility of their reported results. 
1.3   IPMVP’s Relationship To Other M&V Guidelines 
Chapter 9 lists other interesting resources for readers of IPMVP. Appendix C lists other 
guidelines, protocols, and documents from different regions of the world that are applications of 
IPMVP, or provide references to relevant codes, standards, and programs that reference 
IPMVP. 
1.4   Who Uses IPMVP? 
IPMVP presents common principles and terms that are widely accepted as basic to any good 
M&V process. It does not define the M&V activities for all applications. Each project must be 
individually designed to suit the needs of all readers of energy or water savings reports.  This 
individual design is recorded in the project’s M&V Plan and savings are reported as defined 
therein.  
This document is written to progressively provide greater levels of definition of M&V practice as 
it progresses through the Chapters as summarized below. 
 
Chapter 2 defines M&V and descibes eight different applications for M&V techniques. 
 
Chapter 3 present the six foundational principles of good M&V practice and the IPMVP. 
They are useful for guiding M&V design details where IPMVP is silent.

the right Option for any application. Appendix A provides example applications of IPMVP’s 
methods to 12 typical projects.

 
Chapter 8 reviews a variety of common M&V issues that need to be considered in any M&V 
program. A key issue governing the design and operation of an M&V system is the 
competing needs for reasonable accuracy and reasonable cost. Each user must find its own 
balance between the accuracy and cost of reporting. Chapter 8.5 particularly focuses on the 
factors involved in this tradeoff. Appendix B provides an overview of some uncertainty and 
statistical methods, but this overview is not a definitive text on the topic. Users are advised 
to seek appropriate statistical design help for any M&V program data normalization, 
sampling or uncertainty evaluation techniques they may use. Chapter 8 also presents 
design issues surrounding metering for M&V programs, though it is not a definitive text on 
metering.

Chapter 10 lists useful readings, references, and other sources of useful material. 
Though the application of IPMVP is unique to each project, certain types of users will have 
similar methods in their M&V Plans and implementation. Appendix D.1 through D.10 point out

4        Definition and Purposes of M&V 
 
CHAPTER 2   DEFINITION AND PURPOSES OF M&V  
“Measurement and Verification” (M&V) is the process of using measurement to reliably 
determine actual savings4 created within an individual facility by an energy management 
program. Savings cannot be directly measured, since they represent the absence of energy 
use. Instead, savings are determined by comparing measured use before and after 
implementation of a project, making appropriate adjustments for changes in conditions.  
M&V activities consist of some or all of the following: 
 
meter installation calibration and maintenance,  
 
data gathering and screening, 
 
development of a computation method and acceptable estimates,  
 
computations with measured data, and 
 
reporting, quality assurance, and third party verification of reports.  
When there is little doubt about the outcome of a project, or no need to prove results to another 
party, applying M&V methods to calculate savings may not be necessary. However, it is still 
wise to verify (initially and repeatedly) that the installed equipment is able to produce the 
expected savings. Verification of the potential to achieve savings is referred to as operational 
verification,  which may involve inspection, commissioning of equipment, functional performance 
testing and/or data trending (see Section 4.4. below). IPMVP-adherent M&V includes both 
operational verification and an accounting of savings based on site energy measurements 
before and after implementation of a project, and adjustments, as described above.   
M&V is not just a collection of tasks conducted to help a project meet IPMVP requirements. 
Properly integrated, each  M&V task serves to enhance and improve facility operation and 
maintenance of savings. As shown in Figure 1, M&V activities overlap with other project efforts 
(e.g. collecting data to both identify ECMs and establish energy baselines, commissioning and 
operational verification of installed ECMs, and installing monitoring systems to track and 
maintain savings persistence, etc.). Identifying these project synergies and establishing roles 
and responsibilities of involved parties during project planning will support a coordinated team 
effort. This can leverage complementary scopes and control M&V-related costs.

Definition and Purposes of M&V       5 
 
2.1  Purposes Of M&V  
M&V techniques can be used by facility owners or energy efficiency project investors for the 
following purposes: 
a)   Increase energy savings 
Accurate determination of energy savings gives facility owners and managers valuable 
feedback on their energy conservation measures (ECMs). This feedback helps them adjust 
ECM design or operations to improve savings, achieve greater persistence of savings over time, 
and lower variations in savings (Kats et al. 1997 and 1999, Haberl et al. 1996).  
b)   Document financial transactions 
For some projects, the energy efficiency savings are the basis for performance-based financial 
payments and/or a guarantee in a performance contract. A well-defined and implemented M&V 
Plan can be the basis for documenting performance in a transparent manner and subjected to 
independent verification. 
c)   Enhance financing for efficiency projects  
A good M&V Plan increases the transparency and credibility of reports on the outcome of 
efficiency investments. It also increases the credibility of projections for the outcome of 
efficiency investments. This credibility can increase the confidence that investors and sponsors 
have in energy efficiency projects, enhancing their chances of being financed.  
d)   Improve engineering design and facility operations and maintenance  
The preparation of a good M&V Plan encourages comprehensive project design by including all 
M&V costs in the project’s economics. Good M&V also helps managers discover and reduce 
maintenance and operating problems, so they can run facilities more effectively. Good M&V 
also provides feedback for future project designs. 
e)  Manage energy budgets  
Even where savings are not planned, M&V techniques help managers evaluate and manage 
energy usage to account for variances from budgets. M&V techniques are used to adjust for 
changing facility-operating conditions in order to set proper budgets and account for budget 
variances.  
f)   Enhance the value of emission-reduction credits 
Accounting for emission reductions provides additional value to efficiency projects. Use of an 
M&V Plan for determining energy savings improves emissions-reduction reports compared to 
reports with no M&V Plan.   
g)  Support evaluation of regional efficiency programs 
Utilty or government programs for managing the usage of an energy supply system can use 
M&V techniques to evaluate the savings at selected energy user facilities. Using statistical 
techniques and other assumptions, the savings determined by M&V activities at selected 
individual facilities can help predict savings at unmeasured sites in order to report the 
performance of the entire program.  
h)   Increase public understanding of energy management as a public policy tool  
By improving the credibility of energy management projects, M&V increases public acceptance 
of the related emission reduction. Such public acceptance encourages investment in energy-
efficiency projects or the emission credits they may create. By enhancing savings, good M&V 
practice highlights the public benefits provided by good energy management, such as improved 
community health, reduced environmental degradation, and increased employment

6        Principles of M&V 
 
CHAPTER 3   PRINCIPLES OF M&V 
 
The fundamental principles of good M&V5 practice are described below, in alphabetical order. 
Accurate  M&V reports should be as accurate as the M&V budget will allow. M&V costs should 
normally be small relative to the monetary value of the savings being evaluated. M&V 
expenditures should also be consistent with the financial implications of over- or under-reporting 
of a project’s performance. Accuracy tradeoffs should be accompanied by increased 
conservativeness in any estimates and judgements.  
Complete  The reporting of energy savings should consider all effects of a project. M&V 
activities should use measurements to quantify the significant effects, while estimating all 
others.  
Conservative  Where judgements are made about uncertain quantities, M&V procedures 
should be designed to under-estimate savings.  
Consistent  The reporting of a project’s energy effectiveness should be consistent between: 
 
different types of energy efficiency projects; 
 
different energy management professionals for any one project; 
 
different periods of time for the same project; and 
 
energy efficiency projects and new energy supply projects. 
‘Consistent’ does not mean ‘identical,’ since it is recognized that any empirically derived report 
involves judgements which may not be made identically by all reporters. By identifying key 
areas of judgement, IPMVP helps to avoid inconsistencies arising from lack of consideration of 
important dimensions. 
Relevant The determination of savings should measure the performance parameters of 
concern, or least well known, while other less critical or predictable parameters may be 
estimated.  
Transparent  All M&V activities should be clearly and fully disclosed. Full disclosure should 
include presentation of all of the elements defined in Chapters 5 and 6 for the contents of an 
M&V Plan and a savings report, respectively. 
The balance of this document presents a flexible framework of basic procedures and four 
Options for achieving M&V processes which follow these fundamental principles. Where the 
framework is silent or inconsistent for any specific application, these M&V principles should be 
used for guidance.

CHAPTER 4   IPMVP FRAMEWORK AND OPTIONS  
4.1  Introduction 
Energy, water or demand savings6 cannot be directly measured, since savings represent the 
absence of energy/water use or demand. Instead, savings are determined by comparing 
measured use or demand before and after implementation of a program, making suitable 
adjustments for changes in conditions.

As an example of savings determination process, Figure 2 shows the energy-usage history of  
an industrial boiler before and after the addition of an energy conservation measure (ECM) to 
recover heat from its flue gases. At about the time of ECM installation, plant production also 
increased.  
To properly document the impact of the ECM, its energy effect must be separated from the 
energy effect of the increased production. The “baseline energy” use pattern before ECM 
installation was studied to determine the relationship between energy use and production. 
Following ECM installation, this baseline relationship was used to estimate how much energy 
the plant would have used each month if there had been no ECM (called the “adjusted-baseline 
energy”). The saving, or ‘avoided energy use’ is the difference between the adjusted-baseline 
energy and the energy that was actually metered during the reporting period.  
Without the adjustment for the change in production, the difference between baseline energy 
and reporting period energy would have been much lower, under-reporting the effect of the heat 
recovery. 
It is necessary to segregate the energy effects of a savings program from the effects of other 
simultaneous changes affecting the energy using systems. The comparison of before and after 
energy use or demand should be made on a consistent basis, using the following general 
Equation 1):

Savings  =  (Baseline-Period Use or Demand - Reporting-Period Use or Demand) 
 
 
 
 
± Adjustments  
 
 
1) 
 
The "Adjustments" term in this general equation is used to re-state the use or demand of the 
baseline and reporting periods under a common set of conditions. This adjustments term 
distinguishes proper savings reports from a simple comparison of cost or usage before and after 
implementation of an energy conservation measure (ECM). Simple comparisons of utility costs 
without such adjustments report only cost changes and fail to report the true performance of a 
project. To properly report “savings,” adjustments must account for the differences in conditions 
between the baseline and reporting periods.  
The baseline in an existing facility project is usually the performance of the facility or system 
prior to modification. This baseline physically exists and can be measured before changes are 
implemented. In new construction, the baseline is usually hypothetical and defined based on 
code, regulation, common practice or documented performance of similar facilities. In either 
case, the baseline model must be capable of accomodating changes in operating parameters 
and conditions so “adjustments” can be made. 
 
The balance of this Chapter defines basic methods in these measurement and adjustment 
processes. If these methods do not cover all matters that arise in your project, consult the 
Principles of M&V (Chapter 3) for further guidance. 
4.2  Energy, Water and Demand Terminology 
The processes of determining savings in energy are analogous to those for determining savings 
in water or demand. To simplify the descriptions in this document, the italicized word energy will 
commonly be used to mean energy and water use or demand. Similarly the word Energy 
Conservation Measure (ECM) will commonly be used to mean measures to improve efficiency 
or conserve energy or water, or manage demand.  
4.3  The M&V Design and Reporting Process  
The M&V design and reporting process parallels the ECM design and implementation process. 
The M&V processes should involve the following steps:  
1. Consider the needs of the user of the planned M&V report(s). If the user is focused on 
overall cost control, Whole-Facility methods may be most suited. If user focus is on 
particular ECMs, Retrofit Isolation techniques may be most suited (see Chapter 4.4). 
2. While developing the ECM(s), select the IPMVP Option (see Chapters 4.7 - 4.11) that best 
suits the ECM(s), the needs for accuracy and the budget for M&V. Decide whether 
adjustment of all energy quantities will be made to the reporting period conditions or to some 
other set of conditions (see Chapter 4.6). Decide the duration of the baseline period and the 
reporting period (Chapter 4.5) (These fundamental decisions may be written into the terms 
of an energy-performance contract.)  
3. Gather relevant energy and operating data from the baseline period and record them in a 
way that can be accessed in the future.  
4. Prepare an M&V Plan (Chapter 5) containing the results of steps 1 through 3 above. It 
should define the subsequent steps 5 through 9.  
5. As part of the final ECM design and installation, also design, install, calibrate and 
commission any special measurement equipment that is needed under the M&V Plan.

IPMVP Framework and Options       9 
 
6. After the ECM is installed, ensure it has the potential to perform and achieve savings by 
conducting operational verification. This may include inspecting the installed equipment and 
revising operating procedures as needed to conform to the design intent of the ECM. This 
requirement may be fulfilled by a formal "commissioning" process as part of the project .  
 
7. Gather energy and operating data from the reporting period, as defined in the M&V Plan. 
8. Compute savings in energy and monetary units in accordance with the M&V Plan.  
9. Report savings in accordance with the M&V Plan (see Chapter 6).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Steps 7 through 9 are repeated periodically when a savings report is needed.  
A third party may verify that the M&V Plan adheres to IPMVP, and possibly a performance 
contract. This third party may also verify that savings reports comply with the approved M&V 
Plan (see Chapter 8.6).  
 
4.4 Operational Verification 
Operational Verification should be performed as part of any project M&V program. It serves as a 
low-cost initial step for realizing savings potential and should precede savings verification 
activities.  A range of operational verification methods can be applied, as outlined in Table 2. 
Selection of a given approach depends on the ECM’s characteristics as noted. However, it can 
also be influenced by the savings verification approach taken. For example, if Option B is being 
used to verify savings then a more simple visual inspection may suffice for operational 
verification. However if Option A is applied, then a more thorough operational verification 
approach should be used to verify that the ECM functionality is confirmed and characterization 
complete.  
Operational verification activities are accomplished through comprehensive commissioning of 
affected systems supplemented by more data-driven activities (e.g. data trending and review). 
The M&V Plan should note the operational verification approach in addition to the savings 
verification method. Operational verification should be completed prior to implementing M&V 
savings verification activities. This ensures the savings from ECMs, energy-efficient controls 
and operation improvements are fully realized.  
Interactive Effects - Example
 
For an ECM, which reduces the power requirements of electric lights, the 
measurement boundary should include the power to the lights. However lowering 
lighting energy may also lower any mechanical cooling requirements and/or raise 
any heating requirements. Such heating and cooling energy flows attributable to the 
lights cannot usually be easily measured. They are interactive effects which may 
have to be estimated, rather than included within the measurement boundary.

Approach 
Typical ECM Application 
Activities 
Visual Inspection 
ECM will perform as anticipated when 
properly installed; direct measurement 
of ECM performance is not possible. 
Examples: wall insulation, windows 
View and verify the physical installation 
of the ECM 
Sample Spot Measurements 
Achieved ECM performance can vary 
from published data based on 
installation details or component load. 
Examples: fixtures/lamps/ballasts, fans, 
pumps 
Measure single or multiple key energy-
use parameters for a representative 
sample of the ECM installations 
Short-Term Performance 
Testing 
ECM performance may vary depending 
on actual load, controls, and/or 
interoperability of components. 
Examples: Daylighting sensors and 
lighting dimming controls, VSD fans, 
Demand-control ventilation 
Test for functionality and proper control. 
Measure key energy-use parameters. 
May involve conducting tests designed 
to capture the component operating 
over its full range or performance data 
collection over sufficient period of time 
to characterize the full range of 
operation.  
Data Trending and Control-
Logic Review 
ECM performance may vary depending 
on actual load and controls. Component 
or system is being monitored and 
controlled through the BAS or can be 
monitored through independent meters. 
Set up trends and review data and/or 
control logic. Measurement period may 
last for a few days to a few weeks, 
depending on the period needed to 
capture the full range of performance. 
 
Operational verification activities can also be applied following the Reporting Period to support 
energy savings persistence. While ot formally a part of the M&V process, such a practice is 
beneficial for an organization which has improved its energy efficiency.  It reduces the risk of 
adverse shifts in performance associated with ECMs that can fail, fade or be bypassed.  
4.5 Savings Verification  
The following sections add details about how to determine and report savings.  
4.5.1  Measurement Boundary  
Savings may be determined for an entire facility or simply for a portion of it, depending upon the 
purposes of the reporting. 
 
If the purpose of reporting is to help manage only the equipment affected by the savings 
program, a measurement boundary should be drawn around that equipment. Then all 
significant energy requirements of the equipment within the boundary can be determined7. 
This approach is used in the Retrofit Isolation Options of Chapter 4.7.  
 
If the purpose of reporting is to help manage total facility energy performance, the meters 
measuring the supply of energy to the total facility can be used to assess performance and 
savings. The measurement boundary in this case encompasses the whole facility. The 
Whole Facility Option C, is described in Chapter 4.8.   
 
If baseline or reporting period data are unreliable or unavailable, energy data from a 
calibrated simulation program can take the place of the missing data, for either part or all of 
the facility. The measurement boundary can be drawn accordingly. The Calibrated 
Simulation Option D is described in Chapter 4.9.  
                                                  
7 Determination of energy may be by direct measurement of energy flow or by direct measurement of proxies of 
energy use that give direct indication of energy use.

IPMVP Framework and Options       11 
 
Some of the energy requirements of the systems or equipment being assessed may arise 
outside a practical measurement boundary. Nevertheless, all energy effects of the ECM(s) 
should be considered. Those energy effects that are significant should be determined from 
measurements, the rest being estimated or ignored.  
Any energy effects occurring beyond the notional measurement boundary are called ‘interactive 
effects’8. Find a way to estimate the magnitude of these interactive effects in order to determine 
savings. Alternatively they may be ignored as long as the M&V Plan includes discussion of each 
effect and its likely magnitude. 
4.5.2  Measurement Period Selection 
Care should be taken in selecting the period of time to be used as the baseline period and the 
reporting period. Strategies for each are discussed below. 
Baseline Period 
The baseline period should be established to: 
 
Represent all operating modes of the facility. This period should span a full operating cycle 
from maximum energy use to minimum.   
 
 
 
 
Fairly represent all operating conditions of a normal operating cycle. For example, though a 
year may be chosen as the baseline period, if data is missing during the selected year for 
one month, comparable data for the same month in a different year should be used to 
ensure the baseline record does not under represent operating conditions of the missing 
month.   
 
Include only time periods for which all fixed and variable energy-governing facts are known 
about the facility. Extension of baseline periods backwards in time to include multiple cycles 
of operation requires equal knowledge of all energy-governing factors throughout the longer 
baseline period in order to properly derive routine and non-routine adjustments (see Chapter 
4.6) after ECM installation. 
 
Coincide with the period immediately before commitment to undertake the retrofit. Periods 
further back in time would not reflect the conditions existing before retrofit and may therefore 
not provide a proper baseline for measuring the effect of just the ECM. 
ECM planning may require study of a longer time period than is chosen for the baseline period. 
Longer study periods assist the planner in understanding facility performance and determining 
what the normal cycle length actually is. 
                                                  
8 These interactive effects are sometimes called ‘leakages.’ 
 
Whole-building energy use can be significantly affected by weather conditions. 
Typically, a whole year of baseline data is needed to define a full operating 
cycle. 
 
 
The energy use of a compressed air system may only be governed by plant 
production levels, which vary on a weekly cycle. So one week’s data may be 
all that is needed to define baseline performance.

Reporting Period 
The user of the savings reports should determine the length of the reporting period. The 
reporting period should encompass at least one normal operating cycle of the equipment or 
facility, in order to fully characterize the savings effectiveness in all normal operating modes.  
Some projects may cease reporting savings after a defined "test" period ranging from an 
instantaneous reading to a year or two.  
The length of any reporting period should be determined with due consideration of the life of the 
ECM and the likelihood of degradation of originally achieved savings over time.  
Regardless of the length of the reporting period, metering may be left in place to provide 
feedback of operating data for routine management purposes and specifically to detect 
subsequent adverse changes in performance. Section 4.9 explains this at greater length. 
If reducing the frequency of savings measurement after initial proof of performance, other on 
site monitoring activities could be intensified to ensure savings remain in place.  
IPMVP-adherent savings can only be reported for the reporting period that uses IPMVP-
adherent procedures. If IPMVP-adherent savings are used as a basis for assuming future 
savings, future savings reports do not adhere to IPMVP.  
Adjacent Measurement Periods (On/Off Test) 
When an ECM can be turned on and off easily, baseline and reporting periods may be selected 
that are adjacent to each other in time. A change in control logic is an example of an ECM that 
can often be readily removed and reinstated without affecting the facility. 
Such “On/Off tests” involve energy measurements with the ECM in effect, and then immediately 
thereafter with the ECM turned off so that pre-ECM (baseline) conditions return. The difference 
in energy use between the two adjacent measurement periods is the savings created by the 
ECM. Equation 1) of Chapter 4.1 can be used for computing savings, without an adjustments 
term if all energy-influencing factors are the same in the two adjacent periods. 
This technique can be applied under both Retrofit Isolation and Whole-Facility Options. 
However measurement boundaries must be located so that it is possible to readily detect a 
significant difference in metered energy use when equipment or systems are turned on and off.   
The adjacent periods used for the On/Off test should be long enough to represent stable 
operation. The periods should also cover the range of normal facility operations. To cover the 
normal range, the On/Off test may need to be repeated under different operating modes such as 
various seasons or production rates. 
Take notice that ECMs which can be turned Off for such testing also risk being accidentally or 
maliciously turned Off when intended to be On. 
4.5.3  Basis For Adjustments 
The adjustments term shown in Equation 1) of Chapter 4.1 should be computed from identifiable 
physical facts about the energy governing characteristics of equipment within the measurement 
boundary. Two types of adjustments are possible: 
 
Routine Adjustments – for any energy-governing factors, expected to change routinely 
during the reporting period, such as weather or production volume. A variety of techniques 
can be used to define the adjustment methodology. Techniques may be as simple as a 
constant value (no adjustment) or as complex as a several multiple parameter non-linear 
equations each correlating energy with one or more independent variables. Valid 
mathematical techniques must be used to derive the adjustment method for each M&V Plan. 
See Appendix B for some guidance on assessing the validity of mathematical methods.

 
Non-Routine Adjustments – for those energy-governing factors which are not usually 
expected to change, such as: the facility size, the design and operation of installed 
equipment, the number of weekly production shifts, or the type of occupants. These static 
factors must be monitored for change throughout the reporting period. See Chapter 8.2 for 
discussion of non-routine adjustments.  
 
  
Therefore Equation 1) can be expressed more fully as: 
 
Savings  =   ( Baseline Energy –  Reporting-Period Energy ) 
 
 
 
± Routine Adjustments  ±  Non-Routine Adjustments 
1a) 
 
The adjustments terms in Equation 1a) are used to express both pieces of measured energy 
data under the same set of conditions. The mechanism of the adjustments depends upon 
whether savings are to be reported on the basis of the conditions of the reporting period, or 
normalized to some other fixed set of conditions as discussed below9. 
 
                                                  
9 The following general methods can be applied to Options A, B and C described in the rest of the Chapter 4. Option 
D generally includes the adjustments within the simulation, though the set of conditions for adjustment must still be 
chosen. 
 
Static Factors 
Examples of static factors needing non-routine adjustments are changes in the:  
 
amount of space being heated or air conditioned, 
 
type of products being produced or number of production shifts per day 
 
building envelope characteristics (new insulation, windows, doors, air tightness), 
 
amount, type or use of the facility’s and the users’ equipment,  
 
indoor environmental standard (e.g. light levels, temperature, ventilation rate), 
and 
 
occupancy type or schedule.

Reporting-Period Basis or Avoided Energy Use 
When savings are reported under the conditions of the reporting period, they can also be called 
avoided energy use of the reporting period. Avoided energy use quantifies savings in the 
reporting period relative to what energy use would have been without the ECM(s).  
When reporting savings under reporting-period conditions, baseline-period energy needs to be 
adjusted to reporting-period conditions.  
For this common style of savings reporting Equation 1a) can be restated as: 
 
Avoided Energy Use (or Savings)  =   
( Baseline Energy   Routine Adjustments to reporting-period conditions  
 Non-Routine Adjustments to reporting-period conditions ) -  Reporting-Period Energy  
 
This equation is often simplified to the following: 
 
Avoided Energy Use  (or Savings)  =   
 
Adjusted-Baseline Energy – Reporting-Period Energy  
 
 Non-Routine Adjustments of baseline energy to reporting-period conditions     
1b) 
 
Where Adjusted-Baseline Energy is defined as the baseline energy plus any routine 
adjustments needed to adjust it to the conditions of the reporting period.  
The adjusted-baseline energy is normally found by first developing a mathematical model which 
correlates actual baseline energy data with appropriate independent variable(s)in the baseline 
period. Each reporting period’s independent variable(s) are then inserted into this baseline  
mathematical model to produce the adjusted-baseline energy use.

Fixed Conditions Basis or Normalized Savings  
Conditions other than those of the reporting period may be used as the basis for adjustment. 
The conditions may be those of the baseline period, some other arbitrary period, or a typical, 
average or ‘normal’ set of conditions.  
Adjustment to a fixed set of conditions reports a style of savings which could be called 
“normalized savings” of the reporting period. In this method energy of the reporting period and 
possibly of the baseline period are adjusted from their actual conditions to the common fixed (or 
‘normal’) set of conditions selected.  
Equation 1c) restates the more general Equation 1a) for such normalized savings reports: 
 
Normalized Savings =  
 
( Baseline Energy    Routine Adjustments to fixed conditions  
 
 Non-Routine Adjustments to fixed conditions ) 
 
- ( Reporting Period Energy    Routine Adjustments to fixed conditions 
 
 Non-Routine Adjustments to fixed conditions ) 
 
 
1c) 
 
The calculation of the reporting period routine-adjustments term usually involves the 
development of a mathematical model correlating reporting-period energy with the independent 
variables of the reporting period. This model is then used to adjust reporting-period energy to 
the chosen fixed conditions. Further, if the fixed set of conditions is not from the baseline period, 
a mathematical model of baseline energy is also used to adjust baseline energy to the chosen 
fixed conditions.  
 
Independent Variables
An independent variable is a parameter that is expected to change regularly and have 
a measurable impact on the energy use of a system or facility. For example, a 
common independent variable governing building energy use is outdoor temperature. 
Likewise in a manufacturing plant the number of units produced in a period is often an 
independent variable significantly affecting energy use. Another common 
independent variable is the number of seconds, hours or days in each metering 
period. See also Chapter 4.9.3.

4.6  Overview Of IPMVP Options  
The energy quantities in the several forms of Equation 1) can be measured by one or more of 
the following techniques:  
 
Utility or fuel supplier invoices, or reading utility meters and making the same adjustments to 
the readings that the utility makes.  
 
Special meters isolating an ECM or portion of a facility from the rest of the facility. 
Measurements may be periodic for short intervals, or continuous throughout the baseline or 
reporting periods.  
 
Separate measurements of parameters used in computing energy use. For example, 
equipment operating parameters of electrical load and operating hours can be measured 
separately and multiplied together to compute the equipment’s energy use. 
 
Measurement of proven proxies for energy use. For example, if the energy use of a motor 
has been correlated to the output signal from the variable speed drive controlling the motor, 
the output signal could be a proven proxy for motor energy. 
 
Computer simulation that is calibrated to some actual performance data for the system or 
facility being modeled. One example of computer simulation is DOE-2 analysis for buildings 
(Option D only).  
If the a energy value is already known with adequate accuracy or when it is more costly to 
measure than justified by the circumstances, then measurement of energy may not be 
necessary or appropriate. In these cases, estimates may be made of some ECM parameters, 
but others must be measured (Option A only).   
IPMVP provides four Options for determining savings (A, B, C and D). The choice among the 
Options involves many considerations including the location of the measurement boundary (see 
Chapter 4.4). If it is decided to determine savings at the facility level, Option C or D may be 
favored. However if only the performance of the ECM itself is of concern, a retrofit-isolation 
technique may be more suitable (Option A, B or D).  
What Basis for Adjustment, or Which Type of ‘Savings?’ 
Factors to consider when choosing between avoided energy use and normalized savings: 
“Avoided Energy Use” style of savings (Equation 1b)):  
- are dependent upon the reporting period’s operating conditions. Even though savings 
can be properly adjusted for phenomena such as weather, the level of reported savings 
depends upon the actual weather.  
- cannot be directly compared with savings predicted under baseline conditions. 
“Normalized savings” style of savings (Equation 1c): 
- are unaffected by reporting-period conditions since the fixed set of conditions are 
established once and not changed. 
- can be directly compared with savings predicted under the same set of fixed conditions.  
- can only be reported after a full cycle of reporting-period energy use, so that the 
mathematical correlation between reporting-period energy and operating conditions can 
be derived.

4.7  Options A & B: Retrofit Isolation  
Chapter 4.4 defines the concept of a measurement boundary encompassing the retrofitted 
equipment. Retrofit isolation allows the narrowing of the measurement boundary in order to 
reduce the effort required to monitor independent variables and static factors, when retrofits 
affect only a portion of the facility. However boundaries smaller than the total facility usually 
require additional meters at the measurement boundary. Narrow measurement boundaries also 
introduce the possibility of ‘leakage’ through unmeasured interactive effects.  
Since measurement is of less than the total facility, the results of retrofit isolation techniques 
cannot be correlated to the facility’s total energy use shown on utility bills. Facility changes 
beyond the measurement boundary but unrelated to the ECM will not be reported by retrofit-
isolation techniques but will be included in the utility’s metered consumption or demand.

Two Options are presented for isolating the energy use of the equipment affected by an ECM 
from the energy use of the rest of the facility: 
 
Option A: Retrofit Isolation: Key Parameter Measurement (See Chapter 4.8.1) 
 
Option B:  Retrofit Isolation: All Parameter Measurement (See Chapter 4.8.2) 
Isolation metering is placed at the measurement boundary between equipment which the ECM 
affects and equipment which it does not affect.  
When drawing a measurement boundary, care 
should be taken to consider any energy flows 
affected by the ECM but beyond the boundary. A 
method must be derived for estimating such 
interactive effects (See Chapter 4.4). For 
example, a lighting load reduction often reduces 
HVAC system energy use, but the only 
reasonable measurement boundary would 
encompass just the electricity use of the lights, 
not their heating and cooling energy impacts. In 
this case the ECM’s effect on HVAC energy 
requirements is an interactive effect, which must 
be assessed. If the interactive effect is expected 
to be significant, engineering estimates could be 
made of the interactive effect as some fraction of 
the measured lighting-energy savings. 
Conventional heating and cooling calculations 
would be used to determine the appropriate 
fraction(s) for each season. However if the 
measurement boundary can be expanded to 
encompass interactive effects, there is no need to 
estimate them. 
Apart from small estimated interactive effects, the measurement boundary defines the metering 
points and the scope of any adjustments, which may be used in the various forms of Equation 
1). Only changes to energy systems and operating variables within the measurement boundary 
must be monitored to prepare the adjustments term(s) of Equation 1).   
Chapter 4.5 discusses measurement periods, generally. Parameters may be continuously 
measured or periodically measured for short periods. The expected amount of variation in the 
parameter will govern the decision of whether to measure continuously or periodically. Where a 
parameter is not expected to change it may be measured immediately after ECM installation 
and checked occasionally throughout the reporting period. The frequency of this checking can 
be determined by beginning with frequent measurements to verify that the parameter is 
constant. Once proven constant, the frequency of measurement may be reduced. To maintain 
control on savings as measurement frequency drops, more frequent inspections or other tests 
might be undertaken to verify proper operations. 
Continuous metering provides greater certainty in reported savings and more data about 
equipment operation. This information can be used to improve or optimize the operation of the 
equipment on a real-time basis, thereby improving the benefit of the ECM itself. Results from 
several studies have shown five to fifteen percent annual energy savings can be achieved 
through careful use of continuous data logging (Claridge et al. 1994, 1996; Haberl et al. 1995).  
If measurement is not continuous and meters are removed between readings, the location of the 
measurement and the specifications of the measurement device should be recorded in the M&V 
Plan, along with the procedure for calibrating the meter being used. Where a parameter is 
expected to be constant, measurement intervals can be short and occasional. Electric motors in 
Retrofit Isolation Example 
A boiler is replaced with a more 
efficient one. A measurement 
boundary is drawn around just the 
boiler so that the assessment of 
the new boiler is unaffected by 
variations in the heating load of the 
whole facility.  
Meters for fuel consumption and 
boiler heat output are all that are 
needed to assess the efficiencies 
of the two boilers over their full 
range of operations. Savings are 
reported for the boiler retrofit by 
applying the observed efficiency 
improvement to an estimated 
annual boiler load. The boiler 
efficiency test is repeated annually.

an industrial plant provide a common example of constant power flow, assuming they have a 
constant load. However motor-operating periods may vary with the type of product being 
produced from day to day. Where a parameter may change periodically, the occasional 
measurements of the parameter (operating hours in this motor example) should happen at times 
representative of the normal system behavior.  
Where a parameter may vary daily or hourly, as in most building heating or cooling systems, 
continuous metering may be simplest. For weather dependent loads, measurements may be 
taken over a long enough period to adequately characterize the load pattern through all parts of 
its normal annual cycle (i.e. each season, and weekday/weekend) and repeated as necessary 
through the reporting period. Examples of such day-type profiling can be found in Katipamula 
and Haberl (1991), Akbari et al. (1988), Hadley and Tomich (1986), Bou Saada and Haberl 
(1995a, 1995b) and Bou Saada et al. (1996).  
Where multiple versions of the same ECM installation are included within the measurement 
boundary, statistically valid samples may be used as valid measurements of the total parameter. 
Such situations may arise, for example, where total lighting power draw cannot be read at the 
electrical panel due to the presence of non-lighting loads on the same panel. Instead a 
statistically significant sample of fixtures is measured before and after retrofit to assess the 
change in power draw. These sample data may be used as the ‘measurements’ of total lighting 
power draw. Appendix B-3 discusses the statistical issues involved in sampling. 
Portable meters may be used if only short-term metering is needed. The costs of portable 
meters can be shared with other objectives. However, permanently installed meters also provide 
feedback to operating staff or automated control equipment for optimization of systems. Added 
meters may also enable billing of individual users or departments in the facility.   
Retrofit isolation techniques are best applied where:  
 
Only the performance of the systems affected by the ECM is of concern, either due to the 
responsibilities assigned to the parties in an energy performance contract, or due to the 
savings of the ECM being too small to be detected in the time available using Option C.  
 
Interactive effects of the ECM on the energy use of other facility equipment can be 
reasonably estimated, or assumed to be insignificant.  
 
Possible changes to the facility, beyond the measurement boundary, would be difficult to 
identify or assess.  
 
The independent variables, which affect energy use, are not excessively difficult or 
expensive to monitor.  
 
Sub-meters already exist to isolate energy use of systems.  
 
Meters added at the measurement boundary can be used for other purposes such as 
operational feedback or tenant billing.  
 
Measurement of parameters is less costly than Option D simulations or Option C non-routine 
adjustments. 
 
Long term testing is not warranted. 
 
There is no need to directly reconcile savings reports with changes in payments to energy 
suppliers. 
The unique characteristics of each of the retrofit-isolation techniques are discussed in Chapters 
4.7.1 and 4.7.2, below. Common measurement issues arising when using retrofit-isolation 
techniques are discussed in Chapter 4.8.3..

What to Measure? 
Consider the example of a lighting project 
where reporting period power draw is 
measured, but baseline power is not 
measured. Therefore power draw should 
be treated as an estimate in designing an 
Option A procedure. 
As a result, operating hours must be 
measured if the procedure is to adhere to 
IPMVP Option A.
4.7.1  Option A: Retrofit Isolation: Key Parameter Measurement  
Under Option A, Retrofit Isolation: Key Parameter Measurement, energy quantities in Equation 
1) can be derived from a computation using a combination of measurements of some 
parameters and estimates of the others. Such estimates should only be used where it can be 
shown that the combined uncertainty from all such estimates will not significantly affect the 
overall reported savings. Decide which parameters to measure and which to estimate by 
considering each parameter’s contribution to the overall uncertainty of the reported savings. The 
estimated values and analysis of their significance should be included in the M&V Plan (Chapter 
5). Estimates may be based on historical data such as recorded operating hours from the 
baseline, equipment manufacturer’s published ratings, laboratory tests, or typical weather data.   
If a parameter, such as hours of use is known to be constant and not expected to be impacted 
by the ECM, then its measurement in the reporting period is sufficient. The reporting period 
measurement of such constant parameter can also be considered a measurement of its 
baseline value.  
Wherever a parameter, known to vary independently, is not measured in the facility during both 
the baseline and reporting periods, the parameter should be treated as an estimate.  
Engineering calculations or mathematical modeling may be used to assess the significance of 
the errors in estimating any parameter in the reported savings. For example if a piece of 
equipment’s operating hours are to be estimated, but may range from 2,100 to 2,300 hours per 
year, the calculated savings at 2,100 and 2,300 hours should be computed and the difference 
evaluated for its significance to the expected savings. The combined effect of all such possible 
estimations should be assessed before determining whether sufficient measurement is in place. 
See also Appendix B-5.1.  
The selection of which factor(s) to measure may also be considered relative to the objectives of 
the project or the duties of a contractor undertaking some ECM-performance risk. Where a 
factor is significant to assessing performance, it should be measured. Other factors beyond the 
contractor’s control can be estimated.  
If a savings computation involves subtracting a measured parameter from an estimated 
parameter, the result is an estimate. For 
example if a parameter is measured in the 
reporting period and subtracted from an 
unmeasured value for the same parameter in 
the baseline period, the resultant difference is 
only an estimate.  
An example application of Option A is an 
ECM involving the installation of high-
efficiency light fixtures, without changing 
lighting periods. Savings can be determined 
using Option A by metering the lighting-circuit 
power draw before and after retrofit while 
estimating the operating period. Other 
variations on this type of ECM, shown in 
Table 2 below, show the circumstances where estimates adhere to the guidance of Option A.

## Page 122

22        IPMVP Framework and Options 
 
  
When planning an Option A procedure, consider both the amount of variation in baseline energy 
and the ECM’s energy impact before establishing which parameter(s) to measure. The following 
three examples show the range of scenarios that may arise.  
 
ECM reduces a constant load without changing its operating hours. Example: industrial-
plant lighting fixtures are replaced with more efficient ones, but the operating hours of the 
lights do not change. To reasonably measure the effect of the project, fixture power levels 
should be measured in the baseline and reporting periods, while operating hours are 
estimated in the energy calculations. 
 
ECM reduces operating hours while load is unchanged. Example: automatic controls shut 
down air compressors during unoccupied periods. To reasonably measure the effect of the 
project, compressors’ operating time should be measured in both the baseline and reporting 
periods, while compressors’ power can be estimated in the energy calculations. 
 
ECM reduces both equipment load and operating hours. Example: Resetting of temperature 
on a hot-water radiation system reduces overheating and induces occupants to close 
windows, thereby reducing boiler load and operating periods. When both load and operating 
periods are variable and uncertain, Option A cannot be used. 
Generally, conditions of variable load or variable operating hours require more rigorous 
measurement and computations.   
Option A: Calculations 
General Equation 1) in Chapter 4.1 is used in all IPMVP adherent computations. However under 
Option A, there may be no need for adjustments, routine or non-routine, depending upon the 
location of the measurement boundary, the nature of any estimated values, the length of the 
reporting period, or the amount of time between baseline measurements and reporting-period 
measurements.  
Similarly baseline or reporting-period energy measurements involve measurement of only one 
parameter under Option A, and estimation of the other. Therefore Equation 1) may simplify 
down to:

Option A Savings  =  Estimated Value x (Baseline-Period, measured parameter  
 
 
 
 
 
 
– Reporting-period, measured parameter) 
1d) 
Option A: Installation Verification  
Since some values may be estimated under Option A, great care is needed to review the 
engineering design and installation to ensure that the estimates are realistic, achievable, and 
based on equipment that should truly produce savings as intended.  
At defined intervals during the reporting period, the installation should be re-inspected to verify 
continued existence of the equipment and its proper operation and maintenance. Such re-
inspections will ensure continuation of the potential to generate predicted savings and validate 
estimated parameters. The frequency of these re-inspections is determined by the likelihood of 
performance changes. Such likelihood can be established through initial frequent inspections to 
establish the stability of equipment existence and performance.  
An example of a situation needing routine re-inspection is a lighting retrofit. You can determine 
savings by sampling of the performance of fixtures and counting the number of operating 
fixtures. In this case, the continued existence of the fixtures and operation of the lamps is critical 
to the savings determination. Similarly, where the settings of controls are assumed, but subject 
to tampering, regular recordings of control settings or actual equipment functions can limit the 
uncertainty of the estimated values.  
Option A: Cost  
Savings determinations under Option A can be less costly than under other Options, since the 
cost of estimating a parameter is often significantly less than the cost of measurement. However 
in some situations where estimation is the only possible route, a good estimate may be costlier 
than if direct measurement were possible. Cost planning for Option A should consider all 
elements: analysis, estimation, meter installation, and the ongoing cost to read and record data.  
Option A: Best Applications  
In addition to the retrofit isolation best applications in Chapter 4.8, above, Option A is best 
applied where:  
 
Estimation of non-key parameters may avoid possibly difficult non-routine adjustments when 
future changes happen within the measurement boundary.  
 
The uncertainty created by estimations is acceptable.  
 
The continued effectiveness of the ECM can be assessed by simple routine re-testing of key 
parameters.  
 
Estimation of some parameters is less costly than measurement of them in Option B or 
simulation in Option D. 
 
The key parameter(s) used in computing savings can be readily identified. Key parameters 
are parameters used to judge a project’s or contractor’s performance.  
4.7.2  Option B: Retrofit Isolation: All Parameter Measurement 
Option B, Retrofit Isolation: All Parameter Measurement, requires measurement of all Equation 
1) energy quantities, or all parameters needed to compute energy.   
The savings created by most types of ECMs can be determined with Option B. However, the 
degree of difficulty and costs increase as metering complexity increases. Option B methods will 
generally be more difficult and costly than those of Option A. However, Option B will produce 
more certain results where load and/or savings patterns are variable. These additional costs 
may be justifiable if a contractor is responsible for all factors affecting energy savings.

Option B: Calculations 
General Equation 1) in Chapter 4.1 is used in all IPMVP adherent computations. However under 
Option B, there may be no need for adjustments, routine or non-routine, depending upon the 
location of the measurement boundary, the length of the reporting period, or the amount of time 
between baseline and reporting period measurements. Therefore, for Option B, Equation 1 may 
simplify down to: 
 
Option B Savings  =  Baseline Energy  -  Reporting-Period Energy  
1e) 
 
Option B: Best Applications  
In addition to the retrofit-isolation methods in Chapter 4.8, above, Option B is best applied 
where:  
 
Meters added for isolation purposes will be used for other purposes such as operational 
feedback or tenant billing.  
 
Measurement of all parameters is less costly than simulation in Option D. 
 
Savings or operations within the measurement boundary are variable.  
4.7.3 Retrofit Isolation Measurement Issues 
Retrofit isolation usually requires the addition of special meters, on either a short term or 
permanent basis. These meters may be installed during an energy audit to help characterize 
energy use before design of the ECM. Or meters may be installed to measures baseline 
performance for an M&V Plan.  
You can measure temperature, humidity, flow, pressure, equipment runtime, electricity or 
thermal energy, for example, at the measurement boundary. Follow good measurement 
practices to enable calculation of energy savings with reasonable accuracy and repeatability. 
Measurement practices are continually evolving as metering equipment improves. Therefore, 
use the latest measurement practices to support your savings (see also Chapter 8.11).  
The following sections define some key measurement issues to consider when using retrofit-
isolation techniques.   
Electricity Measurements 
To measure electricity accurately we measure the voltage, amperage and power factor, or true 
rms10 wattage with a single instrument. However measurement of amperage and voltage alone 
can adequately define wattage in purely resistive loads, such as incandescent lamps and 
resistance heaters without blower motors. When measuring power, make sure that a resistive 
load’s electrical wave-form is not distorted by other devices in the facility.  
Measure electric demand at the same time that the power company determines the peak 
demand for its billing. This measurement usually requires continuous recording of the demand 
at the sub-meter. From this record, the sub-meter’s demand can be read for the time when the 
power company reports that the peak demand occurred on its meter. The power company may 
reveal the time of peak demand either on its invoices or by special report.  
Electric-demand measurement methods vary amongst utilities. The method of measuring 
electric demand on a sub-mter should replicate the method the power company uses for the 
relevant billing meter. For example, if the power company calculates peak demand using fixed 
                                                  
10 Rms (root mean squared) values can be reported by solid state digital instruments to properly account for the net 
power when wave distortions exist in alternating current circuits.

15 minute intervals, then the recording meter should be set to record data for the same 15 
minute intervals. However if the power company uses a moving interval to record electric 
demand data, the data recorder should have similar capabilities. Such moving interval capability 
can be emulated by recording data on one minute fixed intervals and then recreating the power 
company’s intervals using post-processing software. However, care should be taken to ensure 
that the facility does not contain unusual combinations of equipment that generate high one 
minute peak loads which may show up differently in a moving interval than in a fixed interval. 
After processing the data into power company intervals, convert it to hourly data for archiving 
and further analysis. 
Calibration 
Meters should  be calibrated as recommended by the equipment manufacturer, and following 
procedures of recognized measurement authorities. Primary standards and no less than third-
order-standard traceable calibration equipment should be utilized wherever possible. Sensors 
and metering equipment should be selected based in part on the ease of calibration and the 
ability to hold calibration. An attractive solution is the selection of equipment that is self-
calibrating. 
Selected calibration references  are provided in Chapter 10.3.  
4.8   Option C: Whole Facility  
Option C: Whole Facility, involves use of utility meters, whole-facility meters, or sub-meters to 
assess the energy performance of a total facility. The measurement boundary encompasses 
either the whole facility or a major section. This Option determines the collective savings of all 
ECMs applied to the part of the facility monitored by the energy meter. Also, since whole-facility 
meters are used, savings reported under Option C include the positive or negative effects of any 
non-ECM changes made in the facility.  
Option C is intended for projects where expected savings are large compared to the random or 
unexplained energy variations which occur at the whole-facility level. If savings are large 
compared to the unexplained variations in the baseline-energy data, then identifying savings will 
be easy. Also the longer the period of savings analysis after ECM installation, the less 
significant is the impact of short-term unexplained variations11. Typically savings should exceed 
10% of the baseline energy if you expect to confidently discriminate the savings from the 
baseline data when the reporting period is shorter than two years.  
Identifying facility changes that will require non-routine adjustments is the primary challenge 
associated with Option C, particularly when savings are monitored for long periods. (See also 
Chapter 8.2 on non-routine baseline adjustments.) Therefore, you should perform periodic 
inspections of all equipment and operations in the facility during the reporting period. These 
inspections identify changes in the static factors from baseline conditions. Such inspections may 
be part of regular monitoring to ensure that the intended operating methods are still being 
followed.   
4.8.1 Option C: Energy Data Issues  
Where utility supply is only measured at a central point in a group of facilities, sub-meters are 
needed at each facility or group of facilities for which individual performance is assessed.  
Several meters may be used to measure the flow of one energy type into a facility. If a meter 
supplies energy to a system that interacts with other energy systems, directly or indirectly, this 
meter’s data should be included in the whole-facility savings determination.  
                                                  
11 See Appendix B-5. ASHRAE (2002) provides quantitative methods for assessing the impact of variations in the 
baseline data as the reporting period lengthens.

## Page 126

26        IPMVP Framework and Options 
 
Meters serving non-interacting energy flows, for which savings are not to be determined, can be 
ignored. Separately metered outdoor-lighting circuits is one example.   
Determine savings separately for each meter or sub-meter serving a facility so that performance 
changes can be assessed for separately metered parts of the facility. However, where a meter 
measures only a small fraction of one energy type’s total use, it may be totaled with the larger 
meter(s) to reduce data-management tasks. When electrical meters are combined this way, it 
should be recognized that small consumption meters often do not have demand data associated 
with them so that the totalized consumption data will no longer provide meaningful load factor 
information.  
If several different meters are read on separate days, then each meter having a unique billing 
period should be separately analyzed. The resultant savings can be combined after analysis of 
each individual meter, if the dates are reported. 
If any of the energy data are missing from the reporting period, a reporting-period mathematical 
model can be created to fill in missing data. However the reported savings for the missing 
period should identify these savings as "missing data."  
4.8.2 Option C: Energy Invoices Issues  
Energy data for Option C are often derived from utility meters, either through direct reading of 
the meter, or from utility invoices. Where utility bills are the source of data, it should be 
recognized that a utility’s need for regular meter reading is not usually as great as the needs of 
M&V. Utility bills sometimes contain estimated data, especially for small accounts. Sometimes it 
cannot be determined from the bill itself whether the data came from an estimate or an actual 
meter reading. Unreported estimated meter readings create unknown errors for estimated 
month(s) and and also for the subsequent month of the actual meter reading. However the first 
invoice with an actual reading after one or more estimates will correct the previous errors in 
energy quantities. Savings reports should note when estimates are part of the utility data.  
When an electrical utility estimates a meter reading, no valid data exist for the electrical demand 
of that period.  
Energy may be supplied indirectly to a facility, through on-site storage facilities, such as for oil, 
propane or coal. In these situations, the energy supplier’s shipment invoices do not represent 
the facility’s actual consumption during the period between shipments. Ideally a meter 
downstream of the storage facility measures energy use. However where there is no 
downstream meter, inventory-level adjustments for each invoice period should supplement the 
invoices.  
4.8.3 Option C: Independent Variables  
Regularly changing parameters affecting a facility’s energy use, are called independent 
variables (see also box in Chapter 4.6.1). Common independent variables are weather, 
production volume and occupancy. Weather has many dimensions, but for whole-facility 
analysis, weather is often just outdoor dry-bulb temperature. Production has many dimensions, 
depending upon the nature of the industrial process. Production is typically expressed in mass 
units or volumetric units of each product. Occupancy is defined in many ways, such as hotel-
room occupancy, office-building occupancy hours, occupied days (weekdays/weekends), or 
restaurant-meal sales.  
Mathematical modeling can assess independent variables if they are cyclical. Regression 
analysis and other forms of mathematical modeling can determine the number of independent 
variables to consider in the baseline data (See Appendix B-2). Parameters, which have a 


---

## Page 127

 
IPMVP Framework and Options       27 
 
significant effect on the baseline energy use, should be included in the routine adjustments 
when determining savings12 using Equation 1a), b) or c). 
Independent variables should be measured and recorded at the same time as the energy data. 
For example, weather data should be recorded daily so they can be totaled to correspond with 
the exact monthly energy-metering period, which may be different from the calendar month. Use 
of simple monthly mean temperature data for a non-calendar month energy metering period 
introduces unnecessary error into the analysis.  
4.8.4 Option C: Calculations and Mathematical Models  
For Option C, the routine adjustments term of Equation 1a) is calculated by developing a valid 
mathematical model of each meter’s energy-use pattern. A model may be as simple as an 
ordered list of twelve measured monthly energy quantities without any adjustments. However a 
model often includes factors derived from regression analysis, which correlate energy to one or 
more independent variables such as outdoor temperature, degree days, metering period length, 
production, occupancy, and/or operating mode. Models can also include a different set of 
regression parameters for each range of conditions, such as summer or winter in buildings with 
seasonal energy-use variations. For example, in schools where the building’s energy use differs 
between the school year and the vacation period, you may need separate regression models for 
the different usage periods (Landman and Haberl 1996a; 1996b).  
Option C should use complete years (12, 24, or 36 months) of continuous data, during the 
baseline period, and continuous data during the reporting periods (Fels 1986). Models, which 
use other numbers of months, (9, 10, 13, or 18 months, for example) can create statistical bias 
by under or over-representing normal modes of operation.   
Meter data can be hourly, daily or monthly whole-facility data. Hourly data should be combined 
into daily data to limit the number of independent variables required to produce a reasonable 
baseline model, without significantly increasing the uncertainty in computed savings 
(Katipamula 1996, Kissock et al. 1992). Variation in the daily data often results from the weekly 
cycle of most facilities.  
Many mathematical models are appropriate for Option C. To select the one most suited to the 
application, consider statistical-evaluation indices, such as R2 and t (see Appendix B-2.2)13. 
Appendix B-2.2 or published statistical literature can help you demonstrate the statistical validity 
of your selected model.  
4.8.5 Option C: Metering 
Whole-facility energy measurements can use the utiltity’s meters. Utility-meter data is 
considered 100% accurate for determining savings because this data defines the payment for 
energy. Utility-meter data is usually required to meet commercial accuracy regulations for sale 
of energy commodities.   
The energy supplier’s meter(s) may be equipped or modified to provide an electical pulse output 
that can be recorded by the facility's monitoring equipment. The energy-per-pulse constant of 
the pulse transmitter should be calibrated against a known reference such as similar data 
recorded by the utility meter. 
                                                  
12 All other parameters affecting energy use (i.e. “static factors” see box in Chapter 4.6) should be measured and 
recorded in the baseline and reporting periods so that non-routine adjustments can be made if needed (see Chapter 
8.8) 
13 Additional information concerning these selection procedures can be found in Reynolds and Fels (1988), Kissock et 
al. (1992, 1994) and in the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals (2005) Chapter 32. ASHRAE (2002) also provides 
several statistical tests to validate the usefulness of derived regression models.

28        IPMVP Framework and Options 
 
Separate meters installed by the facility owner can measure whole-facility energy. The accuracy 
of these meters should be considered in the M&V Plan, together with a way of comparing its 
readings with the utility meter readings. 
4.8.6 Option C: Cost 
Option C’s cost depends on the source of the energy data, and the difficulty of tracking static 
factors within the measurement boundary to enable non-routine adjustments during the 
reporting period. The utility meter or an existing sub-meter works well if the meter’s data is 
properly recorded. This choice requires no extra metering cost. 
The cost of tracking changes in static factors depends on the facility’s size, the likelihood of 
static-factor change, the difficulty of detecting changes, and the surveillance procedures already 
in place.  
4.8.7 Option C: Best Applications  
Option C is best applied where:  
 
The energy performance of the whole facility will be assessed, not just the ECMs.  
 
There are many types of ECMs in one facility.  
 
The ECMs involve activities whose individual energy use is difficult to separately measure 
(operator training, wall or window upgrades, for example).  
 
The savings are large compared to the variance in the baseline data, during the reporting 
period (See Appendix B-1.2).  
 
When Retrofit-Isolation techniques (Option A or B) are excessively complex. For example, 
when interactive effects or interactions between ECMs are substantial.   
 
Major future changes to the facility are not expected during the reporting period.  
 
A system of tracking static factors can be established to enable possible future non-routine 
adjustments.  
 
Reasonable correlations can be found between energy use and other independent 
variables.  
4.9   Option D: Calibrated Simulation  
Option D, Calibrated Simulation, involves the use of computer simulation software to predict 
facility energy for one or both of the terms in Equation 1). A simulation model must be 
"calibrated" so that it predicts an energy pattern that approximately matches actual metered 
data.   
Option D may be used to assess the performance of all ECMs in a facility, akin to Option C. 
However, the Option D simulation tool allows you to also estimate the savings attributable to 
each ECM within a multiple-ECM project.  
Option D may also be used to assess just the performance of individual systems within a facility, 
akin to Options A and B. In this case, the system’s energy use must be isolated from that of the 
rest of the facility by appropriate meters, as discussed in Chapters 4.5.1 and 4.7.  
Option D is useful where:  
 
Baseline energy data do not exist or are unavailable. Such situation may arise for: 
o A new construction project 
o A facility expansion needing to be assessed separately from the rest of the facility, or 


---

## Page 129

 
IPMVP Framework and Options       29 
 
o A centrally metered campus of facilities where no individual facility meter exists in the 
baseline period, but where individual meters will be available after ECM installation.  
 
Reporting-period energy data are unavailable or obscured by factors that are difficult to 
quantify. Sometimes it is too difficult to predict how future facility changes might affect 
energy use. Industrial-process changes or new equipment often make the computation of 
non-routine adjustments so inaccurate that Options A, B or C would create excessive error 
in the savings determination.  
 
It is desired to determine the savings associated with individual ECMs, but measurements 
with Options A or B are too difficult or costly.   
If the reporting-period energy is predicted by the simulation software, the determined savings 
persist only if the simulated operating methods continue. Periodic inspections will identify 
changes from baseline conditions and modeled equipment performance (see also Chapter 
4.7.1. Option A Installation Verification). Simulation runs should be adjusted accordingly.  
Option D is the primary M&V approach for assessing energy efficiency inclusions in new facility 
designs. The IPMVP Volume III Part I, titled “Concepts and Options for Determining Savings In 
New Construction”, provides guidance on a variety of M&V techniques applicable to new 
buildings.  
Accurate computer modeling and calibration to measured energy data are the major challenges 
associated with Option D. To control the costs of this method while maintaining reasonable 
accuracy, the following points should be considered when using Option D:  
 
Simulation analysis should be conducted by trained personnel who are experienced with 
both the software and the calibration techniques.  
 
Input data should represent the best available information including as much as possible of 
available actual performance data from key components in the facility 
 
The simulation inputs need to be adjusted so its results match both the demand and 
consumption data from monthly utility bills, within acceptable tolerances (i.e. "calibrated"). 
Close agreement between predicted and actual annual total energy is usually insufficient 
demonstration that the simulation adequately predicts the energy behavior of the facility 
(See Chapter 4.9.2). 
 
Option D requires careful documentation. Simulation printouts, survey data and the metering 
or monitoring data used to define input values and calibrate the simulation model should be 
kept in paper and electronic files. The version number should be declared of publicly 
available software, so that another person can review the computations.  
 
For new construction projects, modeling efforts can be streamlined by retaining the buildng 
energy modeler that created the “as-designed” model to create the calibrated, “as-built” and 
adjusted baseline models. 
 
Building types which are not easily simulated include those with:  
 
large atriums,  
 
a significant fraction of the space underground or ground coupled,  
 
unusual exterior shapes,  
 
complex shading configurations, or 
 
a large number of distinct zones of temperature control.  
Some building ECMs cannot be simulated without great difficulty, such as:  
 
addition of radiant barriers in attics, and  


---

30        IPMVP Framework and Options 
 
 
some complex HVAC system changes.  
4.9.1 Option D: Types of Simulation Programs  
Information on building simulation programs in common use in different parts of the world can 
be found in Appendix C herein  
Whole-building-simulation programs usually use hourly calculation techniques. However 
simplified HVAC system models may also be used if the building’s heat losses, heat gains, 
internal loads, and HVAC systems are simple. Other types of special-purpose programs may be 
used to simulate energy use and operation of devices or industrial processes.  
Any software used must be well documented and well understood by the user. Due to the wide 
variety of available methods, it is prudent to receive acceptance by the owner or project 
authority of the proposed modeling program before commencing analysis. 
4.9.2 Option D: Calibration  
Savings determined with Option D are based on one or more complex estimates of energy use. 
The accuracy of the savings depends on how well the simulation models actual equipment 
performance, and how well calibrated it is to metered energy performance.  
Calibration is achieved by verifying that the simulation model reasonably predicts the energy 
patterns of the facility by comparing model results to a set of calibration data. These calibration 
data include measured energy data, independent variables and static factor.  
Calibration of building simulations is usually done with 12 monthly utility bills. These bills should 
be from a period of stable operation. In a new building, it may take a number of months before 
full occupancy and before the staff learns the best ways to operate the facility. The calibration 
data should be documented in the M&V Plan along with a description of its sources.  
Detailed operating data from the facility help to develop the calibration data. These data might 
include operating characteristics, occupancy, weather, loads and equipment efficiency. Some 
variables may be measured for short intervals (day, week or month) or extracted from existing 
operating logs. The accuracy of meters should be verified for critical measurements. If 
resources permit, building ventilation and infiltration should be measured because these 
quantities often vary widely from expectations. One-time measurements will improve simulation 
accuracy without much additional cost. On/off tests can measure lighting, receptacle loads and 
motor control centers. These tests can be performed over a weekend using a data logger or 
building automation system to record whole-facility energy use, usually at one-minute intervals, 
Sometimes, inexpensive portable loggers, which are synchronized to a common time, are also 
effective for short-term measurement (Benton et al. 1996, Houcek et al. 1993, Soebarto 1996).  
Following collection of as much calibration data as possible, the steps in calibrating the 
simulation are as listed below.  
1. Assume other necessary input parameters, and document them.  
2. Whenever possible, gather actual weather data from the calibration period, especially if 
weather conditions varied significantly from standard-year weather data used in the basic 
simulations. However, obtaining and preparing actual weather data for use with a simulation 
may be time-consuming and expensive. If developing an actual weather data file is too 
difficult, then adjust an average weather file to resemble actual weather data using valid 
statistical methods.  
3. Run the simulation and verify that it predicts operating parameters such as temperature and 
humidity.  
4. Compare the simulated energy results with the metered energy data from the calibration 
period, on an hourly or monthly basis.  


---

## Page 131

 
IPMVP Framework and Options       31 
 
5. Evaluate patterns in the differences between simulation results and calibration data. Bar 
charts, monthly percent difference time-series graphs, and monthly x-y scatter plots help to 
identify the error patterns. The calibration accuracy should be established in the M&V Plan 
to accommodate the M&V budget.  
6. Revise input data in step 1 and repeat steps 3 and 4 to bring predicted results within the 
calibration specifications in 5, above. Collect more actual operating data from the facility to 
meet the calibration specification if necessary.  
The creation and calibration of a simulation is time consuming. Using monthly rather than hourly 
energy data helps to limit the effort needed for calibration. However if Option D will be used to 
determine savings at the ECM level, calibration of major end-uses, systems, and/or equipment 
impacted by the ECMs is recommended.  
4.9.3 Option D: Calculations 
Savings can be determined using calibrated simulation results representing the baseline energy 
and/or the reporting-period energy. For projects with a physical baseline, the two calibrated 
models include one with the ECMs and one without them. For projects with a hypothetical 
baseline, calibrated models may include the hypothetical baseline and the as-built (reporting 
period) conditions, but measured data will only be available for calibration under as-built 
conditions. In either case, both models and measured energy data must be under the same set 
of operating conditions.  
Savings with Option D can be estimated using two forms of Equation 1), Equations 1f) and 
1g)14. Both forms presume that the calibration ‘error’ equally affects both baseline and reporting 
period models. The same savings will be determined from the two equations for any given set of 
data and simulations. 
 
Savings  =  Baseline energy from the calibrated model [hypothetical or without ECMs] 
 
– Reporting-period energy from the calibrated model [with ECMs] 
1f) 
 
One of the model-derived energy terms in Equation 1f) may be replaced by the actual measured 
energy. However, you must adjust your calculations for the calibration error for each month in 
the calibration period, using. Equation 1g): 
 
Savings  =  Baseline energy from the calibrated model [hypothetical or without ECMs] 
 
 
-       Actual calibration-period energy 
 
 
+/-    Calibration error in the corresponding calibration reading 
1g) 
 
Equation 1may be most easily understood by non-technical persons, since the final savings 
computation uses actual metered data rather than only the results of simulation models. 
4.9.4 Option D: Ongoing Savings Reporting 
If multi-year performance evaluation is required, Option D may be used for the first year after 
the ECMs are installed. In later years, Option C may be less costly than Option D if you use as 
the baseline the meter data from the first year of steady operation after installation. Then Option 
C is used to determine whether energy use changes from the first year of operation after the 
ECM was installed. In this situation, the first year of steady operation’s energy use would be 
                                                  
14 Equations 1f) and 1g) are the same as Methods 1 and 2, respectively, found in IPMVP Vol III Part 1.

used: a) to calibrate an Option D simulation model, and b) to establish an Option C baseline for 
measuring additional savings (or losses) in the second year and beyond. 
4.9.5 Option D: Best Applications  
Option D is usually used where no other Option is feasible.  
Option D is best applied where: 
 
Either baseline energy data or reporting-period energy data, but not both, are unavailable or 
unreliable.  
 
There are too many ECMs to assess using Options A or B.  
 
The ECMs involve diffuse activities, which cannot easily be isolated from the rest of the 
facility, such as operator training or wall and window upgrades.  
 
The performance of each ECM will be estimated individually within a multiple-ECM project, 
but the costs of Options A or B are excessive.  
 
Interactions between ECMs or ECM interactive effects are complex, making the isolation 
techniques of Options A and B impractical.  
 
Major future changes to the facility are expected during the reporting period, and there is no 
way to track the changes and/or account for their impact on energy use.  
 
An experienced energy-simulation professional is able to gather appropriate input data to 
calibrate the simulation model.  
 
The facility and the ECMs can be modeled by well documented simulation software. 
 
Simulation software predicts metered calibration data with acceptable accuracy.  
 
Only one year’s performance is measured, immediately following installation and 
commissioning of the energy-management program.   
4.10   Option Selection Guide  
The selection of an IMPVP Option is a decision that is made by the designer of the M&V 
program for each project, based on the full set of project conditions, analysis, budgets and 
professional judgment. Figure 4 outlines common logic used in Option selection.

IPMVP Framework and Options       35 
 
 
4.11   Persistence of Savings  
An organisation which has improved its energy efficiency is more at risk from adverse shifts in 
performance, not only because its ECMs may be of a kind that can fail, fade or be bypassed, 
but also because the additional headroom in its energy budgets may allow unrelated incidents 
of avoidable energy waste to pass unchallenged. 
Persistence of energy savings can be achieved beyond the M&V reporting period by completing 
follow on efforts that build on M&V. One approach is “Monitoring and Targeting” (M&T), which 
can seamlessly follow the M&V process. If Options B and C (see sections 4.6 above) have been 
used for verifying savings, the project will have metering in place for the routine measurement of 
consumption. More importantly, models will also have been developed that correlate energy use 
with driving factors such as weather. These same models can be ‘re-tuned’ to estimate energy 
consumption that accounts for ECM installation. This enables a periodic comparison of actual 
and expected consumption, which will readily reveal and quantify any loss of ECM effect (or 
unrelated waste) enabling prompt remedial action to be taken in cases where the unexpected 
avoidable cost is deemed significant.

CHAPTER 5   M&V PLAN  CONTENTS  
The preparation of an M&V Plan is a recommended part of savings determination. Advance 
planning ensures that all data needed for savings determination will be available after 
implementation of the ECM(s), within an acceptable budget.  
Data from the baseline and details of the ECMs may be lost over time. Therefore record them 
for future reference in case conditions change or ECMs fail. Documentation should be easy to 
find and easy to understand by verifiers and others, because years may pass before these data 
are needed.  
A complete M&V Plan should include discussion of the following 13 topics:  
1. ECM Intent   Describe the ECM, its intended result, and the operational verification 
procedures that will be used to verify successful implementation of each ECM. Identify any 
planned changes to conditions of the baseline, such as unoccupied building temperature 
settings. 
2. Selected IPMVP Option and Measurement Boundary   Specify which IPMVP Option, 
defined in Chapters 4.8 – 4.10, will be used to determine savings. This identification should 
include the date of publication or the version number and Volume number of the IPMVP 
edition being followed (IPMVP Volume I EVO 10000-1:2012), for example). Identify the 
measurement boundary of the savings determination. The boundary may be as narrow as 
the flow of energy through a pipe or wire, or as broad as the total energy use of one or many 
facilities. Describe the nature of any interactive effects beyond the measurement boundary 
together with their possible effects (see Chapter 4.4).  
3. Baseline: Period, Energy and Conditions  Document the facility’s baseline conditions and 
energy data, within the measurement boundary. (In energy performance contracts, baseline 
energy and baseline conditions may be defined by either the owner or the ESCO, providing 
the other party is given adequate opportunity to verify them.)  
An energy audit used for establishing the objectives of a savings program or terms of an 
energy performance contract usually provides most if not all of the baseline documentation 
needed in the M&V Plan. This baseline documentation should include:  
a) Identification of the baseline period (Chapter 4.5.1) 
b) All baseline energy consumption and demand data  
c) All independent variable data coinciding with the energy data (e.g. production rate, 
ambient temperature) 
d) All static factors coinciding with the energy data: 
- Occupancy type, density and periods  
- Operating conditions for each baseline operating period and season, other than the 
independent variables. (For example, in an industrial process, baseline operating 
conditions might include product type(s), raw material type, and number of 
production shifts per day. In a building baseline operating conditions might include 
light level, space temperature humidity and ventilation levels. An assessment of 
thermal comfort and/or indoor air quality (IAQ) may also prove useful in cases where 
the new system performs differently than the old inefficient system. See IPMVP 
Volume II.) 
- Description of any baseline conditions that fall short of required conditions. For 
example, the space is under-heated during the baseline, but the ECM will restore the 
desired temperature. Details of all adjustments that are necessary to the baseline

energy data to reflect the energy-management program’s expected improvement 
from baseline conditions.  
- Size, type, and insulation of any relevant building envelope elements such as walls, 
roofs, doors, windows. 
- Equipment inventory: nameplate data, location, condition. Photographs or 
videotapes are effective ways to record equipment condition.  
- Equipment operating practices (schedules and setpoints, actual temperatures and 
pressures) 
- Significant equipment problems or outages during the baseline period.   
The baseline documentation typically requires well-documented audits, surveys, inspections 
and/or short-term metering activities. The extent of this information is determined by the 
measurement boundary chosen or the scope of the savings determination. 
Where whole-facility M&V methods are employed (Chapter 4.9 or 4.10), all facility 
equipment and conditions should be documented.  
4. Reporting Period  Identify the reporting period. This period may be as short as an 
instantaneous measurement during commissioning of an ECM, or as long as the time 
required to recover the investment cost of the ECM program (See Chapter 4.5.2).  
5. Basis for Adjustment   Declare the set of conditions to which all energy measurements will 
be adjusted. The conditions may be those of the reporting period or some other set of fixed 
conditions. As discussed in Chapter 4.6, this choice determines whether savings are 
reported as avoided energy (4.6.1) or as normalized savings (4.6.2).  
6. Analysis Procedure   Specify the exact data analysis procedures, algorithms and 
assumptions to be used in each savings report. For each mathematical model used, report 
all of its terms and the range of independent variables over which it is valid.  
7. Energy Prices   Specify the energy prices that will be used to value the savings, and 
whether and how savings will be adjusted if prices change in future (See Chapter 8.1). 
8. Meter Specifications  Specify the metering points, and period(s) if metering is not 
continuous. For non-utility meters, specify: meter characteristics, meter reading and 
witnessing protocol, meter commissioning procedure, routine calibration process, and 
method of dealing with lost data (see Chapter 8.11.1).  
9. Monitoring Responsibilities   Assign responsibilities for reporting and recording the energy 
data, independent variables and static factors within the measurement boundary during the 
reporting period. 
10. Expected Accuracy   Evaluate the expected accuracy associated with the measurement, 
data capture, sampling and data analysis. This assessment should include qualitative and 
any feasible quantitative measures of the level of uncertainty in the measurements and 
adjustments to be used in the planned savings report (See Chapter 8.3 and Appendix B). 
11. Budget   Define the budget and the resources required for the savings determination, both 
initial setup costs and ongoing costs throughout the reporting period.  
12. Report Format   Specify how results will be reported and documented (see Chapter 6). A 
sample of each report should be included.  
13. Quality Assurance   Specify quality-assurance procedures that will be used for savings 
reports and any interim steps in preparing the reports.

Depending upon the circumstances of each project, some additional specific topics should also 
be discussed in a complete M&V Plan: 
For Option A: 
 
Justification of Estimates   Report the values to be used for all estimated values. Explain 
the source of these estimated values. Show the overall significance of these estimates to 
the total expected savings by reporting the range of the possible savings associated with the 
range of plausible values of the estimated parameters.  
 
Periodic Inspections  Define the periodic inspections that will be performed in the reporting 
period to verify that equipment is still in place and operating as assumed when determining 
the estimated values. 
For Option D: 
 
Software Name  Report the name and version number of the simulation software to be 
used.  
 
Input/Output Data   Provide a paper and electronic copy of the input files, output files, and 
weather files used for the simulation. 
 
Measured Data   Note which input parameters were measured and which were estimated. 
Describe the process of obtaining any measured data.  
 
Calibration   Report the energy and operating data used for calibration. Report the 
accuracy with which the simulation results match the calibration energy data.  
Where the nature of future changes can be anticipated, define methods for making the relevant 
non-routine adjustments. 
Time and budget requirements (item 11, above) are often underestimated, which leads to 
incomplete data collection. A less accurate and less expensive savings determination is better 
than an incomplete or poorly done determination, which is theoretically more accurate but 
under-funded. Chapter 8.5 addresses cost/benefit tradeoffs. 
Issues arising in developing M&V Plans are discussed in the examples shown in Appendix A. 
The website of Efficiency Valuation Organization (www.evo-world.org) contains a growing 
selection of sample M&V Plans.

M&V Reporting       39 
 
CHAPTER 6   M&V  REPORTING  
M&V Reports should be prepared and presented as defined in the M&V Plan (Chapter 5) 
Complete M&V reports should include at least: 
 
Observed data of the reporting period: the measurement period start and end points in time, 
the energy data, and the values of the independent variables 
 
Description and justification for any corrections made to observed data 
 
For Option A the agreed estimated values 
 
Energy price schedule used 
 
All details of any baseline non-routine adjustment performed. Details should include an 
explanation of the change in conditions since the baseline period, all observed facts and 
assumptions, and the engineering calculations leading to the adjustment. 
 
Computed savings in energy and monetary units. 
M&V reports should be written to their readers’ levels of understanding. 
Energy managers should review the M&V reports with the facility’s operating staff. Such reviews 
may uncover useful information about how the facility uses energy, or where operating staff 
could benefit from more knowledge of the energy-consumption characteristics of their facility.

40        Adherence with IPMVP 
 
CHAPTER 7   ADHERENCE WITH IPMVP  
IPMVP is a framework of definitions and methods for properly assessing savings in energy or 
water use or demand. The IPMVP guides users in developing M&V Plans for specific projects. 
IPMVP is written to allow maximum flexibility in creating M&V Plans, while adhering to the 
principles of accuracy, completeness, conservativeness, consistency, relevance and 
transparency (Chapter 3).  
Users claiming adherence with IPMVP must: 
1. Identify the person responsible for approving the site-specific M&V Plan, and for making 
sure that the M&V Plan is followed for the duration of the reporting period.  
2. Develop a complete M&V Plan which: 
 
clearly states the date of publication or the version number of the IPMVP edition and 
Volume being followed, 
 
uses terminology consistent with the definitions in the version of IPMVP cited,  
 
includes all information mentioned in the M&V Plan chapter (Chapter 5 of the present 
edition),  
 
is approved by all parties interested in adherence with IPMVP, and 
 
is consistent with the Principles of M&V shown in Chapter 3. 
 
3.   Follow the approved IPMVP adherent M&V Plan. 
4.   Prepare M&V reports containing the information mentioned in the M&V Reporting chapter 
(Chapter 6). 
Users wishing to specify the use of IPMVP in an energy performance contract or emission trade 
may use phrases such as, “The determination of actual energy and monetary savings will follow 
current best practice, as defined in IPMVP Volume I, EVO 10000 -1:2012.”  
Specification may go further to include “The M&V Plan shall adhere to IPMVP Volume I, EVO 
10000 - 1:2012 and be approved by……” and may also, if known at the time of contract 
approval, add, “following IPMVP Option ….”

Other Common M&V Issues       41 
 
CHAPTER 8   OTHER COMMON M&V  Facilities Services ProviderUES 
Beyond the basic framework described in Chapter 4, there are a number of issues which 
commonly arise regardless of the IPMVP Option chosen. Each of these issues is discussed in 
this Chapter.  
8.1  Applying Energy Prices  
Cost savings15 are determined by applying the appropriate price schedule in the following 
equation: 
 
Cost Savings = Cb – Cr 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2) 
 
Where: 
 
Cb = Cost of the baseline energy plus any adjustments16  
Cr = Cost of the reporting period energy plus any adjustments 
 
Costs should be determined by applying the same price schedule in computing both Cb and Cr.  
When the conditions of the reporting period are used as the basis for reporting energy savings 
(i.e. avoided energy use Chapter 4.6.1), the price schedule of the reporting period is normally 
used to compute “avoided cost.”  
Examples of the application of energy prices are contained in the examples of Appendix A. 
8.1.1 Price Schedules 
The price schedule should be obtained from the energy supplier. This price schedule should 
include all elements that are affected by metered amounts, such as consumption charges, 
demand charges, transformer credits, power factor, demand ratchets, fuel price adjustments, 
early payment discounts and taxes.  
Price schedules may change at points in time different from meter reading dates. Therefore, Cb 
and Cr in Equation 2) should be computed for periods exactly aligned with price change dates. 
This alignment may require an estimated allocation of quantities to periods before and after the 
price change date. The allocation methodology should be the same as that used by the energy 
supplier. 
The selected price schedule may be fixed at the date of ECM installation, or changed as prices 
change. (Increasing prices will shorten the ECM payback period. Decreasing prices will 
lengthen the payback period though total energy costs will drop when prices drop.) Where a 
third party has invested in an owner’s facility, the price schedule for savings reporting is not 
normally allowed to drop below that which prevailed at the time of commitment to the 
investment. 
                                                  
15 See Chapter 9 for the definition of “savings.” See also Chapter 4.6 for discussion of the 
difference between energy savings and avoided energy or normalized savings. The same 
discussion applies to the difference between cost savings and cost avoidance or normalized cost 
savings. 
16 Adjustments are the appropriate ones described in Chapter 4.

42        Other Common M&V Issues 
 
8.1.2 Marginal Price 
An alternative procedure for valuing savings involves multiplying energy units saved by the 
marginal price of energy. Be careful to ensure that the marginal price is valid for the level of 
consumption and demand of both the baseline and reporting periods.  
Average, or blended prices, determined by dividing billed cost by billed consumption, are often 
different from marginal prices. In this situation average prices create inaccurate statements of 
cost savings and should not be used. 
8.1.3 Fuel Switching and Price Schedule Changes 
The Chapter 8.1 general strategy of applying the same price schedule to baseline and reporting 
period energy introduces some special considerations when the ECM creates a change in fuel 
type or a change in price schedule between the baseline and reporting periods. Such situations 
arise, for example, when an ECM includes a change to a lower cost fuel, or shifts the energy 
use pattern such that the facility qualifies for a different price schedule.  
In such situations, use the price schedule of the baseline commodity to determine Cb in 
Equation 2). The price schedule of the reporting-period commodity should be used in 
determining Cr. However, both commodity-price schedules would be for the same time period, 
usually the reporting period.  
For example, the heating source is changed from electricity to gas, and you intend to use 
reporting period prices. Then Cb would use the reporting period’s electricity-price schedule for all 
electricity. Cr would use the reporting period’s gas-price schedule, for the new gas load, and the 
reporting period’s electricity-price schedule for any remaining electricity use.  
However, this treatment of an intentional change of price schedule does not apply if the change 
was not part of the ECM(s) being assessed. For example, if the utility changed its price 
structures for no reason related to the ECM(s) being assessed, the Chapter 8.1 general 
principle of using the same price schedule for Cb and Cr still applies. 
8.2  Baseline Adjustments (Non-Routine) 
Conditions, which vary in a predictable fashion and are significant to energy use within the 
measurement boundary, are normally included within the mathematical model used for routine 
adjustments, described in Chapter 4.6.  Where unexpected or one-time changes occur in 
conditions within the measurement boundary, which are otherwise static (static factors), non-
routine adjustments, also called baseline adjustments, must be made (see also Chapter 4.6).   
Non-routine adjustments are needed where a change occurs to equipment or operations within 
the measurement boundary after the baseline period. Such change occurs to a static factor not 
to independent variables. For example, an ECM improved the efficeincy of a large number of 
light fixtures. When more light fixtures were installed, after ECM installation, a non-routine 
adjustment was made. The estimated energy of the extra fixtures was added to the baseline 
energy so that the ECM’s true savings were still reported. 
Values estimated for use in IPMVP Option A are usually chosen to eliminate the need for 
adjustments when changes happen within the measurement boundary (see Chapter 4.8.1). 
Therefore non-routine adjustments can be avoided using Option A. For example, a chiller plant’s 
cooling load was estimated rather than measured in order to determine Option A savings 
created by a chiller efficiency ECM. After retrofit, a facility addition increased the actual cooling 
load within the measurement boundary. However since Option A was chosen using a fixed 
cooling load, reported savings are unchanged. The use of Option A avoided the need for a non-
routine adjustment. 
Baseline conditions need to be fully documented in the M&V Plan so that changes in static 
factors can be identified and proper non-routine adjustments made.  It is important to have a 


---

## Page 143

 
Other Common M&V Issues       43 
 
method of tracking and reporting changes in these same static factors. This tracking of 
conditions may be performed by one or more of: the facility owner, the agent creating savings, 
or a third party verifier. It should be established in the M&V Plan who will track and report each 
static factor. 
Where the nature of future changes can be anticipated, methods for making the relevant non-
routine adjustments should be included in the M&V Plan. 
Non-routine adjustments are determined from actual or assumed physical changes in 
equipment or operations (static factors). Sometimes it may be difficult to quantify the impact of 
changes, for example, if they are numerous or not well documented. If the facility's energy 
consumption record is used to quantify the impact of such changes, the impact of the ECMs on 
the facilitiy’s energy consumption must first be removed by Option B techniques. Option C 
cannot be used to determine savings when the facilitiy’s energy meter is also used to quantify 
the impact of changes to static factors. 
8.3  The Role Of Uncertainty (Accuracy) 
The measurement of any physical quantity includes errors because no measurement instrument 
is 100% accurate. Errors are the differences between observed and true energy use. In a 
savings-determination process, errors prevent the exact determination of savings. Equation 1) 
usually involves at least two such measurement errors (baseline and reporting period energy), 
and whatever error exists in the computed adjustments. To ensure that the resultant error 
(uncertainty) is acceptable to the users of a savings report, be certain to manage the errors 
inherent in measurement and analysis when developing and implementing the M&V Plan.   
Characteristics of a savings determination process which should be carefully reviewed to 
manage accuracy or uncertainty are: 
 
Instrumentation – measurement equipment errors are due to calibration, inexact 
measurement, or improper meter selection installation or operation.   
 
Modeling – the inability to find mathematical forms that fully account for all variations in 
energy use. Modeling errors can be due to inappropriate functional form, inclusion of 
irrelevant variables, or exclusion of relevant variables. 
 
Sampling – use of a sample of the full population of items or events to represent the entire 
population introduces error as a result of: the variation in values within the population, or 
biased sampling. Sampling17 may be done in either a physical sense (i.e., only 2% of the 
lighting fixtures are measured) or a temporal sense (instantaneous measurement only once 
per hour).   
 
Interactive effects (beyond the measurement boundary) that are not fully included in the 
savings computation methodology.  
 
Estimation of parameters using Option A, rather than measurement. You can minimize the 
variation between the parameter’s estimated value and its true value through careful review 
of the ECM design, careful estimating of the parameter, and careful ECM inspection after 
installation.  
Methods of quantifying, evaluating and reducing some of these uncertainties are discussed in 
this document’s  Appendix B. Appendix C lists some references from different regions about 
applying standard-error-analysis methods to the typical savings determination. These 
quantification tools should only be used to develop the M&V Plan, in order to test the inherent 
uncertainty associated with optional M&V program characteristics.  
                                                  
17 As used in this Protocol, sampling does not refer to rigorous statistical procedures, but to the best practices as 
addressed in Appendix B-3.

44        Other Common M&V Issues 
 
Establish the users’ acceptable savings accuracy during the M&V Planning process. Chapter 
8.5 discusses some issues in establishing the correct level of uncertainty for any ECM or 
project. Appendix B-1.2 defines how large savings must be, relative to statistical variations in 
baseline data, for M&V reports to be valid.  
The accuracy of any measured value is properly expressed as the range within which we expect 
the true value to fall, with some level of confidence.  For example, a meter may measure 
consumption as 5,000 units with a precision of ±100 units, and a confidence of 95%. Such 
statement means that 95% of the readings of the same true value are expected to be between 
4,900 and 5,100 units.   
In a savings determination, it is feasible to quantify many uncertainty factors but usually not all 
of them. Therefore when planning an M&V process, you report both quantifiable uncertainty 
factors and also qualitative elements of uncertainty. The objective is to recognize and report all 
uncertainty factors, either qualitatively or quantitatively. 
When you describe precision within any savings report, report the savings with no more 
significant digits than the least number of significant digits in metered quantities, estimates or 
constants used in the quantification process. See Chapter 8.12. 
8.4  Cost 
The cost of determining savings depends on many factors such as: 
 
IPMVP Option selected, 
 
the number of ECMs and the complexity and amount of interaction among them, 
 
number of energy flows across the measurement boundary in Options A, B, or D when 
applied to a system only, 
 
level of detail and effort associated with establishing baseline conditions needed for the 
Option selected, 
 
amount and complexity of the measurement equipment (design, installation, maintenance, 
calibration, reading, removal), 
 
sample sizes used for metering representative equipment,  
 
amount of engineering required to make and support the estimations used in Options A or 
D, 
 
number and complexity of independent variables which are accounted for in mathematical 
models, 
 
duration of the reporting period, 
 
accuracy requirements, 
 
savings report requirements, 
 
process of reviewing or verifying reported savings, and 
 
experience and professional qualifications of the people conducting the savings 
determination. 
M&V costs should be appropriate for the size of expected savings, the length of the ECM 
payback period, and the report users’ interests in accuracy, frequency, and the duration of the 
reporting process. Often these costs can be shared with other objectives such as real time 
control, operational feedback, or tenant or departmental sub-billing. Prototype or research 
projects may bear a larger than normal M&V cost, for the sake of accurately establishing the 
savings generated by ECMs which will be repeated. However IPMVP is written to provide many 


---

## Page 145

 
Other Common M&V Issues       45 
 
possible ways to document the results of an ECM so that users can develop low-cost M&V 
procedures that provide adequate information. 
It is difficult to generalize about costs for the different IPMVP Options, since each project will 
have its own budget. However, M&V should incur no more cost than needed to provide 
adequate certainty and verifiability in the reported savings, consistent with the overall budget for 
the ECMs.   
 
Option A 
Number of measurement points; complexity of 
estimation; frequency of reporting period inspections. 
Option B 
Number of measurement points; length of the reporting 
period. 
Option C 
Number of static factors to be tracked during the 
reporting period; number of independent variables to be 
used for routine adjustments. 
Option D 
Number and complexity of systems simulated; number of 
field measurements needed to provide input data for the 
calibrated simulation; skill of professional simulator in 
achieving calibration. 
 
Table 4 highlights key cost-governing factors unique to each Option, or not listed above. 
Commonly, since Option A involves estimates, it will involve fewer measurement points and 
lower cost, providing estimation and inspection costs are not unusually high. Option A methods 
usually have lower cost and higher uncertainty than Option B methods.   
Since new measurement equipment is often involved in Options A or B, the cost of maintaining 
this equipment may make Option C less costly for long reporting periods. However, the costs of 
extra meters for Options A or B may be shared with other objectives of monitoring or cost 
allocation. 
When multiple ECMs are installed at one site, it may be less costly to use Options C or D than 
to isolate and measure multiple ECMs with Options A or B. 
An Option D simulation model is often time-consuming and costly. However, the model may 
have other uses such as for designing the ECMs themselves or designing a new facility. 
Expect M&V costs to be highest at the beginning of the reporting period. At this stage in a 
project, measurement processes are being refined, and accurate performance monitoring helps 
to optimize ECM operation. The cost for each savings determination should be in proportion to 
the expected savings and the variation in savings (see Chapter 8.5).  
A contractor is often responsible for only certain performance indicators. Other indicators may 
not have to be measured for contractual purposes, though the facility owner may still wish to 
measure all indicators. In this situation, the owner and contractor share the costs of 
measurement. 
8.5  Balancing Uncertainty And Cost 
The acceptable level of uncertainty in a savings report is related to the cost of decreasing 
uncertainty to an appropriate level for the expected amount of  savings. Typically average 
annual M&V costs are less than 10% of the average annual savings being assessed. The 
 
Table 4  Unique Elements 
of M&V Costs

## Page 146

46        Other Common M&V Issues 
 
quantity of savings at stake therefore places a limit on the M&V budget, which in turn 
determines how much uncertainty is acceptable. 
For example, consider a project with an expected savings of $100,000 per year and $5,000/year 
cost for a basic M&V approach with a precision no better than ±$25,000 per year with 90% 
confidence. To improve the precision to ±$7,000 it may be seen as reasonable to increase M&V 
expenditures up to $10,000/year (10% of the savings), but not $20,000/year (20%).  
The acceptable level of uncertainty in a savings-reporting process is often a personal matter, 
which depends on the report reader’s desire for rigor. However reducing uncertainty requires 
more or better operational data. Enhanced operational data enables fine tuning of savings and 
enhancement of other operational variables. More operational information may also help to size 
equipment for plant expansions or for the replacement of old equipment.  
Enhanced feedback created by M&V may also allow higher payments to be made under an 
energy performance contract based on measured data rather than deemed values of savings, 
which must be conservative.  
Additional investments for lower uncertainty should not exceed the expected increase in value. 
This issue is discussed in more detail by Goldberg (1996b). 
Of course, not all uncertainties can be quantified (see Chapter 8.3). Therefore both quantitative 
and qualitative uncertainty statements should be considered when considering M&V cost 
options for each project. 
For each project, site and facility owner, there is an optimal M&V Plan. That optimal M&V Plan 
should include iterative consideration of the sensitivity of the savings uncertainty and M&V cost 
to each M&V design parameter. Appendix B presents methods of quantifying uncertainty. 
Appendices B-5.1 and B-5.2 present methods of combining several components of uncertainty 
and setting uncertainty criteria or objectives.   
Not all ECMs should expect to achieve the same level of M&V uncertainty since uncertainty is 
proportional to the complexity of the ECM and the variations in operations during both the 
baseline period and reporting period. For example, Option A methods may allow the savings 
from a simple industrial-plant lighting retrofit to be determined with less uncertainty than the 
savings from a chiller retrofit, since estimated lighting parameters may have less uncertainty 
than estimated chiller-plant parameters.  
In determining the measurement level and associated costs, the M&V Plan should consider the 
amount of variation in the energy use within the measurement boundary. For example, indoor 
lighting may use electricity fairly consistently all year, making it relatively easy to determine 
savings, while heating and cooling loads change seasonally making savings identification more 
difficult. Consider the following general guidelines for balancing cost and uncertainty in an M&V 
process.18 
1. Low Energy Variation & Low-Value ECM.  Low-value ECMs cannot typically afford much 
M&V, based on the 10%-of-savings guideline, especially if there is little variation in the 
measured energy data.  Such combined situations would tend to favour use of Option A, 
and short reporting periods, for example, in the case of a constant-speed exhaust-fan motor 
that operates under a constant load according to a well-defined schedule.  
2. High Energy Variation & Low-Value ECM.  Low-value ECMs cannot generally afford much 
M&V, as in 1, above. However with a high amount of variation in the energy data, the all-
parameter measurement techniques of Option B may be needed to achieve the required 
uncertainty. Sampling techniques may be able to reduce Option B costs. Option C may not 
be suitable based on the general guidance in Chapter 4.9 that savings should exceed 10% 
of a facility’s metered use in order to be measurable.

3. Low Energy Variation & High-Value ECM.  With low variation in energy use, the level of 
uncertainty is often low, so Option A techniques may be most suitable. However, since you 
expect high savings, small improvements in precision may have monetary rewards large 
enough to merit more precise metering and data analysis, if you can keep M&V costs 
appropriate relative to the savings. For example, if the savings from an ECM are $1,000,000 
annually, you may decide to increase the $5,000 annual M&V cost to $20,000, if it increases 
precision and provides more operational data. Alternatively, a high-value ECM may be 
clearly measurable with Option C. Option C can keep M&V costs low, if simple means are 
used to monitor static factors to detect the need for non-routine adjustments. 
4. High Energy Variation & High-Value ECM.  This situation allows appropriate uncertainty 
reduction through extensive data collection and analysis using Options A, B or D.  However 
savings are also likely to show in the utility records, so that Option C techniques may be 
used with careful monitoring of static factors to detect the need for non-routine adjustments.  
The reporting period may have to span multiple normal cycles of facility operation.   
8.6  Verification by an Independent Verifier  
Where a contractor is hired by a facility owner to make and report energy savings, the owner 
may need an independent verifier to review the savings reports. This independent verifier 
should begin by reviewing the M&V Plan during its preparation, to ensure that the savings 
reports will satisfy the owner's expectations for uncertainty.  
The independent review could also examine non-routine adjustments. However full review of 
non-routine adjustments requires good understanding of the facility, its operations and energy 
engineering calculation techniques. The facility owner should provide summaries of changes in 
static factors so that the verifier can focus on the engineerign calculations in the non-routine 
adjustments. 
An energy performance contract requires that both parties believe that the performance 
payments are based on valid information. An independent verifier may be helpful to ensure 
measurement validity and to prevent conflicts. If conflicts arise during the reporting period, this 
independent verifier can help to resolve the conflicts. 
Independent verifiers are typically engineering consultants with experience and knowledge in 
ECMs, M&V and energy performance contracting. Many are members of industry professional 
societies, or are Certified Measurement and Verification Professionals (CMVP®s).19 
8.7  Data for Emission Trading 
Adherence to IPMVP can provide increased confidence in energy-savings reports, which also 
increases confidence in associated reports of emission-reduction commodities.  
Combined with the specific M&V Plan of each project, IPMVP enhances consistency of 
reporting and enables validation and verification of energy-saving projects. However to verify an 
emission-reduction commodity, IPMVP and the project's M&V Plan must be used in conjunction 
with the emission-trading program's specific guidance on converting energy savings into 
equivalent emissions reductions. 
Emission trading will be facilitated if the following energy-reporting methods are considered 
when designing the process for determining the units of energy saved. 
 
Electrical savings should be split into peak period and off peak periods, and ozone season 
and non-ozone season when NOx or VOC trading is involved. These periods are defined by 
the relevant emission-trading program. 
                                                  
19 The CMVP® program is a joint activity of Efficiency Valuation Organization and the Association of 
Energy Engineers (AEE). It is accessible through EVO’s website www.evo-world.org.

 
Reductions in purchases from the electrical grid should be divided into those due to load 
reduction and those due to increased self-generation at the facility. 
 
The adjusted baseline used for computing energy savings may need to change to suit the 
requirements of the particular emission-trading program. For emission-trading purposes, 
adjusted baselines need to consider whether the ECMs were 'surplus' or 'additional' to 
normal behavior. ECMs may not be allowed for emisison trading if they are 'business as 
usual' or  simply compliance with existing regulations. Baseline rules are defined by the 
relevant emission-trading program. For example, where equipment minimum–efficiency 
standards govern the equipment market, these standards set the baseline for determining 
tradable amounts.  
 
Segregate energy savings by site, if a project spans a power pool's boundary line, or if 
emission quantities may be outside an air shed of concern. 
 
Segregate fuel savings by fuel or boiler type, if different emission rates apply to each 
combustion device. 
Each emission-trading system usually has its own rules surrounding emission factors to be 
applied to energy savings. For fuel savings, default emission rates may be given when no 
emission-measuring equipment is in place. For electricity savings, default values may also be 
given for the power grid emission rate. Alternatively users may establish their own emisison rate 
for electricity savings, following recognized principles such as those published as part of the 
Guidelines for Grid-Connected Electricity Projects (WRI 2007).  
8.8  Minimum Operating Conditions 
An energy-efficiency program should not affect the use of the facility to which it is applied, 
without the agreement of building occupants or industrial process managers. Key user 
paramaters may be: light level, temperature, ventilation rate, compresssed air pressure, steam 
pressure and temperature, water flow rate, production rate, etc.  
The M&V Plan should record the agreed minimum operating conditions that will be maintained 
(see Chapter 5).  
IPMVP Volume II, Concepts and Practices for Improved Indoor Environmental Quality, suggests 
methods of monitoring indoor space conditions throughout an energy-efficiency program.  
8.9  Weather Data 
Where monthly energy measurements are used, weather data should be recorded daily so it 
can be matched to the actual energy-metering reading dates.  
For monthly or daily analysis, government published weather data is usually the most accurate 
and verifiable. However weather data from government sources may not be available as 
promptly as site-monitored weather data. If you use on-site weather-monitoring equipment, be 
sure it is regularly and properly calibrated. 
When analyzing the response of energy use to weather in mathematical modeling, daily mean 
temperature data or degree days may be used. 
8.10  Minimum Energy Standards  
When a certain level of efficiency is required either by law or the facility owner's standard 
practice, savings may be based on the difference between reporting-period energy and that 
minimum standard. In these situations, baseline-period energy may be set equal to or less than 
the applicable minimum energy standards.

8.11  Measurement Issues 
The proper application of meters for specific applications is a science in itself. Numerous 
references are available for this purpose (see Chapter 10.2). The EVO web site contains 
relevant current references on measurement techniques.  
Table 5, below, summarizes some key types of meters, and provides comment on M&V matters 
for some of them. This Table should neither be taken as complete nor definitive. 
8.11.1 Data Collection Errors and Lost Data 
No data collection process is without error. Methodologies for reporting period data collection 
differ in degree of difficulty, and consequently in the amount of erroneous or missing data that 
may arise. The M&V Plan should establish a maximum acceptable rate of data loss and how it 
will be measured. This level should be part of the overall accuracy consideration. The level of 
data loss may dramatically affect cost. The M&V Plan should also establish a methodology by 
which missing or erroneous reporting-period data will be re-created by interpolation for final 
analysis. In such cases, reporting-period models are needed to interpolate between measured 
data points so that savings can be calculated for each period.   
Note that baseline data consist of real facts about energy and independent variables as they 
existed during the baseline period. Therefore baseline data problems should not be replaced by 
modelled data, except when using Option D. Where baseline data is missing or inadequate, 
seek other real data to substitute, or change the baseline period so that it contains only real 
data. The M&V Plan should document the source of all baseline data.

8.11.2 Use of Control Systems for Data Collection 
A computerized control system can provide much of the monitoring necessary for data 
collection.  However, the system’s hardware and software must be capable of performing 
control and data gathering simultaneously, without slowing computer processing, consuming 
excess communication bandwidth, or overfilling storage.  
Some measured parameters may not be useful for control: electric power metering, for example. 
Trending of small power, lighting and main-feed power consumption may be very useful for 
high-quality savings determination and operational feedback, but useless for real-time control. 
Control system software can often perform other functions to assist the tracking of changes to 
static factors during the reporting period, such as automatically recording changes in set-points.  
Facility staff should be properly trained in this use of the system so they can develop their own 
trending information for diagnosing system problems, providing the system has the capacity for 
extra trending. However where a contractor is responsible for some operations controlled by the 
system, security arrangements should ensure that persons can only access functions for which 
they are competent and authorized. 
The control-system design and monitoring team may have a direct read-only connection into the 
system via a modem link so that it can easily inspect trend data in the team’s office. However 
possible concerns for virus attacks and computer security should be addressed in this situation. 
Control systems can record energy use with their trending capability. However, some systems 
record "change of value" (COV) events that are not directly used for calculating energy savings 
without tracking time intervals between individual COV events (Claridge et al. 1993, Heinemeier 
and Akbari 1993). It is possible to tighten COV limits in order to force the trending towards more 
regular intervals, but this can overload systems that are not designed for such data densities.  
Great care should be exercised to: 
 
Control access and/or changes to the sysem trend log from which the energy data are 
extracted. 
 
Develop post-processing routines for changing any control-system COV data into time-
series data for performing an analysis. 
 
Get from the control system supplier:  
o standard traceable calibrations of all sensors it supplies,  
o evidence that proprietary algorithms for counting and/or totaling pulses and units are 
accurate. (Currently, there are no industry standards for performing this analysis (Sparks 
et al. 1992)), and 
o commitment that there is adequate processing and storage capacity to handle trending 
data while supporting the system's control functions. 
 
8.12  Significant Digits 
When performing any arithmetic calculation, one must consider the inherent accuracy of the 
data so the result does not presume greater accuracy than is defendable.  For this reason, 
engineers have adopted a standard of rounding rules that limits the resolution of a result to that 
which is supported by the data.  Therefore, the IPMVP has adopted the following rules to insure 
all calculations performed under this standard adhere to strict accuracy standards.

From equation 3.2, we can calculate the limits of absolute error. The rules for significant digits 
agree with equation 3.2 when the absolute error is greater than or equal to ±1 unit of the 
smallest significant digit. 
To calculate the significant digits of a number, simply count the number of digits ignoring any 
leading zeros or trailing zeros terminating at the “ones” column (without a decimal point).  Any 
trailing zeros to the right or left of a decimal point are considered significant.

 
12300.000 → 8 significant digits.

Please also note that the significant digit rules do not mix well together.  Carry out all 
calculations by “arithmetic operation” before proceeding to the next operation type. 
 
8.12.2  SPECIAL CASES 
Some numbers are represented with finite significant digits even though they can be treated as 
exact.  Exact numbers have infinite significant digits.  An example of an exact number could be 
a utility rate.  If a local power company’s rate was $0.06 per kWh and Company X used 
725,691.0 kWhs one month, the utility bill would be $43,541.46, not $40,000 per the 
multiplication rule above.  This is because the utility rate is exact … it can be represented as 
 per kWh.  There is no measurement error associated with utility rates. 
Another example includes time variables.  If Company X was guaranteed energy savings of  
$1.15M per year for 3 years, the total savings would be $3.45M, not $3M.  Unless expressed as 
a decimal number, a time variable should be considered as exact. 
Care must be taken to recognize these numbers in M&V calculations else the precision of the 
result may be compromised.

Definitions         55 
 
CHAPTER 9   DEFINITIONS 
 
Terms are italicized in the text to signify that they have the following meanings: 
Adjusted-baseline energy:  The energy use of the baseline period, adjusted to a different set 
of operating conditions. 
Avoided energy use:  The reduction in energy use that occurred in the reporting period, 
relative to what would have occurred if the facility had been equipped and operated as it was in 
the baseline period but under reporting period operating conditions. (see Chapter 4.6.1). “Cost 
avoidance” is the monetary equivalent of “avoided energy use.” Both are commonly called 
savings. Normalized savings is another type of savings.  
Baseline Adjustments: The non-routine adjustments (Chapters 4.6 and 8.2) arising during the 
reporting period from changes in any energy governing characteristic of the facility within the 
measurement boundary, except the named independent variables used for routine adjustments. 
Baseline Energy: The energy use occurring during the baseline period without adjustments. 
Baseline Period:  The period of time chosen to represent operation of the facility or system 
before implementation of an ECM. This period may be as short as the time required for an 
instantaneous measurement of a constant quantity, or long enough to reflect one full operating 
cycle of a system or facility with variable operations. 
Baseline:  Pertaining to the baseline period. 
Confidence Level: The probability that any measured value will fall within a stated range of 
precision. See Appendix B-1.1. 
Constant:  A term used to describe a physical parameter which does not change during a 
period of interest. Minor variations may be observed in the parameter while still describing it as 
constant. The magnitude of variations that are deemed to be ‘minor’ must be reported in the 
M&V Plan. 
Commissioning:  A process for achieving, verifying and documenting the performance of 
equipment to meet the operational needs of the facility within the capabilities of the design, and 
to meet the design documentation and the owner's functional criteria, including preparation of 
operating personnel. 
CV(RMSE):  See Appendix B-2.2.2 
Coefficient of Variance (cv):  See Appendix B-3.1  
Cycle:  The period of time between the start of successive similar operating modes of a facility 
or piece of equipment whose energy use varies in response to operating procedures or 
independent variables. For example the cycle of most buildings is 12 months, since their energy 
use responds to outdoor weather which varies on an annual basis. Another example is the 
weekly cycle of an industrial process which operates differently on Sundays than during the rest 
of the week. 
Degree Day: A degree day is measure of the heating or cooling load on a facility created by 
outdoor temperature. When the mean daily outdoor temperature is one degree below a stated 
reference temperature such as 18oC, for one day, it is defined that there is one heating degree 
day. If this temperature difference prevailed for ten days there would be ten heating degree 
days counted for the total period. If the temperature difference were to be 12 degrees for 10 
days, 120 heating degree days would be counted. When the ambient temperature is below the 
reference temperature it is defined that heating degree days are counted. When ambient 
temperatures are above the reference, cooling degree days are counted. Any reference

56        Definitions 
 
temperature may be used for recording degree days, though it is usually chosen to reflect the 
temperature at which a particular building no longer needs heating or cooling. 
Demand:  The rate of energy use. Many utilities base a portion of their bills on the highest (or 
peak) demand they measure during each billing period. Peak demand value are sometimes 
referred to as simply “demand.” Electrical demand is normally expressed in kilowatts (kW). The 
sum of monthly billed kW quantities can be expressed in unit of kW-months. See also Demand 
Ratchet.  
Demand Ratchet:  A method utilities use to establish the demand for which they invoice when it 
is different from the demand they meter. Utilities may consider seasonal maximums or 
minimums, power factor, or contract amounts to set the demand on invoices (called “billing 
demand”).   
Energy:  Energy or water use, or demand.  
Energy Conservation Measure (ECM):  An activity or set of activities designed to increase the 
energy efficiency of a facility, system or piece of equipment. ECMs may also conserve energy 
without changing efficiency. Several ECM's may be carried out in a facility at one time, each 
with a different thrust. An ECM may involve one or more of: physical changes to facility 
equipment, revisions to operating and maintenance procedures, software changes, or new 
means of training or managing users of the space or operations and maintenance staff. An ECM 
may be applied as a retrofit to an existing system or facility, or as a modification to a design 
before construction of a new system or facility. 
Energy Performance Contract:  A contract between two or more parties where payment is 
based on achieving specified results, such as reductions in energy costs or payback of 
investment within a stated period. 
Energy Services Company (ESCO):  A firm which provides services of design and 
construction of ECMs under an energy performance contract. 
Estimate:  A process of determining a parameter used in a savings calculation through methods 
other than measuring it in the baseline and reporting periods. These methods may range from 
arbitrary assumptions to engineering estimates derived from manufacturer’s rating of equipment 
performance. Equipment performance tests that are not made in the place where they are used 
during the reporting period are estimates, for purposes of adherence with IPMVP. 
Facility:  A building or industrial site containing several energy using systems. A wing or section 
of a larger facility can be treated as a facility of its own if it has meters which separately 
measure all of its energy.  
Independent Variable:  A parameter that is expected to change regularly and have a 
measurable impact on the energy use of a system or facility. 
Interactive Effects:  Energy effects created by an ECM but not measured within the 
measurement boundary. 
Marginal Price:  The cost of one additional unit of a commodity billed under a complex rate 
schedule. 
Mean:  See Appendix B-1.3. 
Mean Bias Error (MBE):  See Appendix B-2.2.2. 
Measurement and Verification (M&V): The process of using measurements to reliably 
determine actual savings created within an individual facility by an energy management 
program. Savings cannot be directly measured, since they represent the absence of energy 
use. Instead savings are determined by comparing measured use before and after 
implementation of a project, making appropriate adjustments for changes in conditions. See 
also Chapter 2.

Definitions         57 
 
Measurement Boundary:  A notional boundary drawn around equipment and/or systems to 
segregate those which are relevant to savings determination from those which are not. All 
energy uses of equipment or systems within the measurement boundary must be measured or 
estimated, whether the energy uses are within the boundary or not. See Chapter 4.4. 
Metering: Collection of energy data over time at a facility through the use of measurement 
devices. 
M&V Plan:  The document defined in Chapter 5. 
Non-Routine Adjustments:  The individually engineered calculations in Equation 1a) of 
Chapter 4 to account for changes in static factors within the measurement boundary since the 
baseline period. When non-routine adjustments are applied to the baseline energy they are 
sometimes called just “baseline adjustments.” (See also Chapter 8.2.) 
Normalized Savings:  The reduction in energy use or cost that occurred in the reporting period, 
relative to what would have occurred if the facility had been equipped and operated as it was in 
the baseline period but under a normal set of conditions. These normal conditions may be a 
long term average, or those of any other chosen period of time, other than the reporting period. 
Normal conditions may also be set as those prevailing during the baseline period, especially if 
they were used as the basis for predicting savings. (See Chapter 4.6.2) If conditions are those 
of the reporting period, the term avoided energy use (see Chapter 4.6.1), or just savings, is 
used instead of normalized savings. 
Operational Verification: Verification that the ECMs are installed and operating properly and 
have the potential to generate savings. Operational verification may involve inspections, 
functional performance testing, and/or data trending with analysis. 
Precision:  The amount by which a measured value is expected to deviate from the true value.  
Precision is expressed as a “±” tolerance. Any precision statement about a measured value 
should include a confidence statement. For example a meter’s precision may be rated by the 
meter manufacturer as ±10% with a 95% confidence level. See Appendices B-1.1 and B-1.2 for 
definitions of Absolute Precision and Relative Precision. 
Probable Error:  See Appendix B-5. 
Proxy:  A measured parameter substituted in place of direct measurement of an energy 
parameter, where a relationship between the two has been proven on site. For example, if a 
relationship has been proven between the output signal from a variable speed drive controller 
and the power requirements of the controlled fan, this output signal is a proxy for fan power. 
R Squared (R2):   See Appendix B-2.2.1. 
Regression Analysis:  A mathematical technique that extracts parameters from a set of data to 
describe the correlation of measured independent variables and dependent variables (usually 
energy data). See Appendix B-2. 
Reporting Period:  The period of time following implementation of an ECM when savings 
reports adhere to IPMVP. This period may be as short as the time for an instantaneous 
measurement of a constant quantity; long enough to reflect all normal operating modes of a 
system or facility with variable operations; the length of the financial payback period for an 
investment; the duration of a performance measurement period under an energy performance 
contract; or indefinite. 
Routine Adjustments:  The calculations in Equation 1a) of Chapter 4 made by a formula 
shown in the M&V Plan to account for changes in selected independent variables within the 
measurement boundary since the baseline period. 
Savings:  The reduction in energy use or cost. Physical savings may be expressed as avoided 
energy use or normalized savings (see Chapter 4.6.1 and 4.6.2, respectively). Monetary savings 
may be expressed analogously as “cost avoidance” or “normalized cost savings” (see Chapter

8.1). Savings, as used in IPMVP, are not the simple difference between baseline and reporting 
period utility bills or metered quantities. See Chapter 4.1 for elaboration on this point.  
Significant Digits: Non-zero digits, and zeroes having non-zero digits to their left. Note that 
whole numbers (numbers displaying no decimal point) have an unlimited number of significant 
digits. Whole numbers ending in zero have an unclear number of significant digits. (See also 
Chapter 8.12.) Note also that when adding numbers, the significant digits rule is replaced by a 
rule on the number of digits after the decimal place. The number of such digits in any sum 
should match that of the number with the fewest such digits. 
Simulation Model: An assembly of algorithms that calculates energy use for a facility based on 
engineering equations and user-defined parameters. 
Standard Deviation:  See Appendix B-1.3. 
Standard Error:  See Appendix B-1.3. 
Standard Error of the Coefficient:  See Appendix B-2.2.3. 
Standard Error of the Estimate:  See Appendix B-2.2.2. 
Static Factors:  Those characteristics of a facility which affect energy use, within the chosen 
measurement boundary, but which are not used as the basis for any routine adjustments. These 
characteristics include fixed, environmental, operational and maintenance characteristics. They 
may be constant or varying. (See particularly Chapters 4.6 and 8.2.) 
t-statistic:  See Appendix B-2.2.3. 
Variance:  See Appendix B-1.3. 
Verification: The process of examining a report prepared by others to comment on its suitability 
for the intended purpose.

A-2  Pump/Motor Efficiency Improvement – Option A 
Situation  Ten irrigation pump-sets are distributed around a South African agricultural property 
to pump water from underground wells. Pump operation is usually continuous during the normal 
six-month annual dry season, though pumps are turned on and off manually as needed. The 
local utility offered a partial subsidy to replace the pumps with new high-efficiency pumps and

Appendix A Examples         69 
 
motors. To make the final payment of the subsidy, the utility required short-term demonstration 
of avoided energy use in a form that adheres to IPMVP.  The owner is interested in replacing his 
old pumps and reducing energy costs, so he paid for the balance of the installation costs and 
agreed to provide data to the utility after retrofit.  
Factors Affecting the M&V Design  Pump electricity metering is by 5 utility owned 
consumption meters. These meters serve only the 10 pumps. Before implementation of the 
project it was considered possible that the new pumps might enhance pumping rates at some 
wells, so that pumping hours could be reduced. The owner and the utility recognize that 
operating hours and therefore savings depend upon the growing conditions and rainfall each 
year. Neither party has control over these energy-governing variables.  
The owner sought the lowest possible cost for gathering and reporting information to the utility. 
The owner hired a contractor to select and install pumps that met his and the utility’s 
specifications.  
Pump flow is constant when operating because there are no restricting valves and well depth is 
largely unaffected by the pumping. 
M&V Plan  The M&V Plan was jointly developed by the owner and utility, following a model 
provided by the utility. IPMVP Volume I, EVO 10000 – 1:2012, Option A was selected to 
minimize M&V costs. The agreed Option A method is to negotiate an estimate of the annual 
pump operating hours for a normal year, and multiply that number by measured power 
reductions.  
It was agreed that the installation contractor’s measurement equipment would be adequately 
accurate to measure motor wattage requirements. Before removal, the contractor measured the 
power draw of each old motor after it had been running for at least 3 hours. The utility company 
maintained the right to witness these measurements. Since the pumps are constant-flow, 
average annual operating hours were derived from the billed electricity kWh consumption of the 
past year divided by the measured kW power draw of the old pump motors. This computation 
showed that on average the pumps operated for 4,321 hours in the dry year before retrofit. The 
utility found data revealing that total rainfall during that dry season was 9.0% less than normal. 
The owner and utility therefore agreed that pump operation during that year was 9.0% longer 
than normal. They agreed that normal hours would be 91.0% of 4,321, or 3,93222 hours per 
year.  
Results  The energy savings were determined using IPMVP Option A, Equation 1d) as follows: 
 
Total load of all pumps before retrofit: 
132 kW 
Total load of all pumps after retrofit:    
98.2 kW 
Net load reduction: 
   
 
 
33.8 kW23 
Energy savings: = 34 kW x 3,932 hours/year = 130,000 kWh/year24 
 
The utility company’s final payment of its subsidy was based on 130,000 kWh energy savings. 
                                                  
22 Note this 3,932 number should be expressed with only 3 significant digits, since 91.0% has only 3 significant digits. 
It should more correctly be expressed as 3.93 x 103. However common form is used.  
23 The actual calculated number of 33.8 should be treated as having 2 significant digits. This statement is made 
because the subtraction that led to the 33.8 should show no more digits to the right of the decimal than the number 
with the fewest to its right (132 has none, so 34 has none). 
24 The products of 34 and 3,932 have only 2 significant digits. Though the result is133,688, the proper expression of 
their product is 1.3 x 105, or 130,000.

Using the same estimated operating periods, the owner’s estimated savings under normal 
rainfall conditions and at current utility prices were determined to be 34 kW × 3,932 hr25 x 
R0.2566/kWh = R34,000/year.26 Utility service and network charges were unchanged. 
A-2.1  Pump/Motor Demand Shifting – Option B 
Situation  The irrigation system described in Appendix A-2 above was also eligible for a 
substantial utility incentive if the pumps are kept off during the peak periods of 0700-1000 and 
1800-2000 on all weekdays that are not public holidays. The owner installed a radio-signal-
based control system to remotely and automatically control the pumps to implement this load 
shifting strategy. The pump control will be reset by the owner annually according to the 
upcoming year’s schedule of public holidays. 
Factors Affecting the M&V Design  The owner believed that curtailing pumping for a 
maximum of 25 hours per week (15%) would not be critical to his operation in dry seasons. (He 
expected fewer breakdowns of the new pumps, so there would be no net impact on his dry-
season growth.) 
The utility recognizes that the owner decides whether to shut down the pumps based on his own 
needs. Therefore the utility required adherence to IPMVP Volume I, EVO 10000 – 1:2012, 
Option B to substantiate each year’s performance, before making the incentive payment.  
The owner felt that his financial payback period for the control and monitoring equipment was 
already long. Therefore he does not want to spend a significant part of the incentive on 
providing the evidence required by the utility.   
M&V Plan  The utility and owner agreed that continuous recording of a proxy variable would 
give the ongoing evidence that the pumps were off during every peak period all year long.  The 
proxy variable is the presence of electricity flow (in excess of the 500mA needed by the control 
equipment) through any of the 5 electrical feeds to the 10 pumps. Small un-calibrated current 
sensors and data loggers were clamped on each power line near the 5 meters. The sensors and 
loggers have a re-chargeable battery-backup power system.  
The owner has hired the supplier of the control and monitoring devices to annually read the 
data, check the clock settings, and give a report to the utility of the dates and times of any 
operation within any weekday peak periods.   
Results  For the first year after implementation of the control and monitoring system, the 
monitoring agent reported to the utility that power was used between 1800 hrs and 2000 hrs on 
5 specific weekdays. The utility verified that these days were all public holidays, so there were 
no operations during the defined peak periods. The demand shift was determined to be 98.2 
kW, from the measurement of the new pumps (see Appendix A-2). The annual utility incentive 
was computed and paid based on this Option B recorded 98.2 kW demand shift.
A-3  Lighting Efficiency – Option A 
Situation  More efficient light fixtures are installed in place of existing fixtures in a Canadian 
school, while maintaining light levels. This project was part of a broader program of the school 
board to hire a contractor, who would design, install and finance many changes in a number of 
schools. Payments under the contract are based on measured savings at the utility prices 
prevailing at the time of signing the contract. Savings are to be demonstrated, according to an 
IPMVP adherent M&V Plan, immediately after commissioning of the retrofit. Since the owner 
controls operation of the lights, the contract specified that the M&V Plan follow IPMVP Volume I, 
                                                  
25 133,688 is the actual calculated value before significant digit rounding. 
26 This amount can be expressed in no more than 2 significant digits, as from the above observations about the 
minimum number of significant digits. The actual calculated value is R34,103 and should better be expressed as R3.4 
x 104, though 34,000 is customary currency format.

EVO 10000 – 1:2012, Option A, using estimated operating hours. The M&V Plan was to be 
detailed after contract signing. 
Factors Affecting the M&V Design  In developing the M&V Plan the following were 
considered:  
 
All light fixtures are powered by a common 347-volt supply system dedicated to lighting. This 
situation makes power measurement simple.  
 
Operation of lights significantly affects heating energy requirements, so the interactive effect 
needed to be estimated. 
 
Operation of lights significantly affects mechanical-cooling requirements.  However, since 
very little of the school is mechanically cooled and that space is usually vacant during the 
warmer weather, cooling interactive effects were ignored. 
 
School-board officials had difficulty accepting an arbitrary assumption of lighting operating 
periods. They agreed to pay for a carefully instrumented two-month period of logging lighting 
patterns in one school. This test would substantiate the estimated operating hours that 
would be agreed for all schools. 
M&V Plan  The measurement boundary of this ECM was drawn to include the lighting fixtures 
connected to the 347-volt supply system.   
 
The heating interactive effect was determined by engineering calculations to be a 6.0% 
increase in boiler-output energy requirements, for the period from November through March. 
Boiler efficiency in winter was estimated to be 79% under typical winter conditions.  
 
The static factors recorded for the baseline included a lighting survey giving a description, 
location, light level, and count of the number of operating and burned out lamps ballasts and 
fixtures.  
 
30 lighting loggers were placed in randomly chosen classrooms, corridors, locker rooms, 
and offices and also in the gym and auditorium, for two months.  This period included the 
one-week spring holiday and two legal holidays. Table A-3-1 summarizes the data obtained.

Since classrooms are the largest load, the relative precision of the classroom operating period 
measurements was evaluated before school board officials could agree to estimated values.  
For the 19 classroom loggers, the standard deviation among the readings for 6 recorded school 
weeks was found to be 15 hours per week. With 19 x 6 = 114 readings, the standard error in the 
mean values was computed to be 1.4 hours per week (Equation B-4). At 95% confidence, the 
value of t for a large number of observations is 1.96 (Table B-1).  Therefore, using Equation B-9, 
it was established with 95% confidence that the relative precision in the measured classroom 
operating hours is:

School board officials deemed this measurement precision adequate.   
Before estimating values for all schools, it was decided to add 6 hours per week to classroom 
hours because of plans to increase night school classes.  Considering that there are 39 school 
weeks and 13.2 holiday weeks in an average year (with leap years), the estimated annual 
operating hours were agreed to be as follows:

Since the lighting retrofit was applied uniformly to all fixtures, the load-weighted average 
estimated annual operating hours for this school were determined to be 2,996, or 3,000 rounded 
to 3 significant digits (a better representation of the result would be 3.00 × 103).  
 
Baseline power measurements were made with a recently calibrated true rms watt meter of 
the three-phase power draw on the 347-volt lighting circuits. From a thirty-second 
measurement on the input side of two lighting transformers, it was found that with all fixtures 
switched on, the total power draw was 288 kW. Seventy lamps (= 3 kW or 1%) were burned 
out at the time of the test. It was determined that the fraction burned out at the time of this 
measurement was normal. 
 
Since lighting loads establish the building electrical peak at a time when all lights are on, 
electrical demand savings will be estimated to be the same as the measured load reduction 
on the lighting circuits. The utility bills showed a lower demand during the summer holidays, 
and there was minimal use of the facility during these months. Also considering which other 
equipment was used during the summer, it was assumed that the July and August lighting-
circuit demand is only 50% of the peak measured circuit load. 
 
The marginal utility prices at the time of contract signing was CDN$0.063/kWh, 
CDN$10.85/kW-month, and CDN$0.255/m3 of gas. 
Results  After installation of the ECM, the lighting circuit power was re-measured as in the 
baseline test.  The power draw was 162 kW with all lights on and none burned out.  With the 
same 1% burnout rate as in the base year, the post-retrofit period maximum power would be 
160. kW (=162 x 0.990). Therefore the power reduction is 288. – 160. = 128 kW. 
Energy savings (using Equation 1d) with no adjustments) are 128 kW x 3.00 × 103 hrs/year = 
384,000 kWh/year.  
Demand savings are 128 kW for 10.0 months and 64 kW for 2.0 months, for a total of 1,410 kW-
months. 
The value of the electrical savings estimated under IPMVP Option A is: 
 
( 384,000 kWh  x  $0.0630 )  +  ( 1,410  x $10.85 )  =  CDN$39,500

Assuming the lighting savings are achieved uniformly over a 10 month period, the typical winter 
month electrical savings are 384,000/10 = 38,400 kWh/month.  The associated boiler load 
increase is 6.0% of these electrical savings for November through March, namely: 
 
=  6.0% x 38,400 kWh/mo x 5.0 months  =  12,000 kWh 
Extra boiler input energy is: 
 
=  12,000 kWh / 79% = 6.0% x 38,400 kWh/mo x 5.0 months / 79% = 15,000 kWh 
equivalent units of fuel input. 
The gas being used in the boiler has an energy content of 10.499 kWh/m3, so the amount of 
extra gas is = 15,000  / 10.499 = 1,400 m3 gas  
The value of the extra gas used in winter is 1,400 x $0.255 = CDN$360. Therefore total net 
savings are $39,500 – $360 = CDN$39,100.   
A-3-1  Lighting Operational Control – Option A 
Situation  A knitting mill in southern India typically operates 2 shifts per day. There was a 
standing order for the supervisors to turn off all lights in each zone at the end of the second 
shift. There are 70 light switches. Supervisors regularly changed between working on the first 
and second shifts. They habitually forgot their duty to turn off lights.  
The plant manager undertook a project to modify the lighting so that occupancy sensors turned 
lights on and off. He wanted to document the results to show the supervisors how poorly they 
had been using the light switches.  
Factors Affecting M&V Design  None of the production area had windows or skylights. It is 
neither heated nor cooled. Lighting circuits are integrated with other electrical loads so that 
lighting use could not be easily isolated from other uses of electricity. 
The plant manager did not wish to spend a lot to determine savings, but needed a credible 
statement of the savings. 
The electricity price for medium sized commercial users is 450 p/kWh. 
M&V Plan  To minimize M&V costs it was decided to perform savings measurements for only a 
short representative period and use IPMVP Volume I, EVO 10000 – 1:2012, Option A. Since the 
primary purpose of the retrofit was to control production area lighting hours, a sampling based 
method was developed to measure the change in operating hours. The lighting power (for use in 
Equation 1d)) was estimated from manufacturers’ ratings to be 223 kW.  
Lighting loggers were placed randomly around the production area to record the operating hours 
of randomly chosen lighting zones. The number of loggers was chosen as follows, to obtain an 
overall precision in operating period estimates of ±10%, at 90% confidence. It was expected that 
the mean operating hours before installation of the occupancy sensors would be 125 hours per 
week, and that the standard deviation in readings would be 25. Therefore the initially estimated 
cv is 0.20 and the necessary number of samples (with z of 1.96) is 15 (Equation B-16). Since 
there are only 70 zones, the finite population adjustment lowers the estimated required number 
of loggers to 12 (Equation B-17). It was assumed that after installation of occupancy sensors the 
cv will be much lower so the 12 loggers will be adequate. 
There are no interactive effects of this retrofit on other building loads because the plant is 
neither heated nor air-conditioned. The reduction in night-time lighting is expected to make the 
building more thermally comfortable at the beginning of the morning shift. 
Results  After a one month period, data was gathered from the loggers and the average weekly 
operating hours computed for the 12 zones. The mean value was 115 and the standard 
deviation was 29. Therefore the cv was 0.24 ( = 29 / 115 ), higher than the expected value and 
worse than necessary to meet the precision requirement. Therefore another month of recording 
was undertaken. Then the mean of the eight weeks of average weekly values was 118, and the 


---

## Page 174

74        Appendix A Examples 
 
standard deviation was 24 (cv = 0.20). This was deemed an adequate measurement of 
operating hours in the baseline period, with no occupancy sensors. 
The occupancy sensor controls were installed after the above baseline test. Operating hours 
were again logged in the same locations for a month. The mean was found to be 82 hours per 
week, and the standard deviation was 3 hours. In this situation the cv is 0.04 and well within the 
required 0.2, so the one-month readings were accepted. No changes had happened to the way 
the plant was used or occupied, so there is no need to make any non-routine adjustment to the 
baseline data. 
The reduction in operating hours was 118 – 82 = 36 hours per week.  Savings were computed 
using Equation 1d) as: 
 
223 kW x 36 hours/week = 8,000 or 8.0 × 103 kWh/week 
With 48 weeks of operation every year, the annual value of the consumption savings is:   
 
= (8.0 × 103) x 48 x 450 / 100 = Rs 1.7 million 
There are no demand savings since the retrofits only affect off peak power use. 
Therefore, following IPMVP Option A, it can be stated with 90% confidence that the savings, in 
the month after occupancy sensor installation, were Rs17 lakh ±10%, given the estimate of 
installed lighting load. 
A-3-2  Street Light Efficiency and Dimming – Option B 
Situation  A Croatian city’s public lighting system was in need of substantial repair and 
updating. A new lighting system was installed on the same wiring, including high-efficiency 
fixtures and a dimming system which curtails lighting power by up to 50% in the quietest hours. 
The lighting is distributed across the city, with 23 metering points. The retrofit included the 
addition of centralized dimming control. The city retained the current lighting-maintenance 
contractor to design, install and maintain the system. The city obtained a savings performance 
guarantee from the contractor. The city required the contractor to continuously demonstrate 
achievement of the guaranteed savings. 
Factors Affecting The M&V Design  The baseline light levels were inconsistent because 20% 
of the fixtures were burned out. The city wished to maintain a more uniform light level. Therefore 
it upgraded its public lighting maintenance contract to specify that burnouts be no more than 
3.0% at any time.  
Since dimming is critical to the savings, continuous recording of energy use is required. The 23 
utility meters measure energy use continually. However these meters cannot provide the rapid 
operational feedback necessary to avoid significant energy wastage if a dimmer fails or is 
accidentally changed. Consequently an energy recording capability was added to the central 
dimming control system, to remotely record energy use in the city’s central control station. 
Beyond simple energy reporting, the system compares actual hourly energy use on each circuit 
to an expected hourly profile. Variances from this Retail Chain A are used to spot burnouts and failures 
of the dimming system. 
M&V Plan  Baseline electricity on all 23 utility meters for the past year totaled 1,753,000 kWh, 
from utility bills. The number and location of all fixtures in the baseline period was recorded as 
part of the M&V Plan, along with the operating setpoints of the lighting control system. 
Annual energy, recorded on the bills for same accounts will be totaled for determining savings 
using IPMVP Volume I, EVO 10000 – 1:2012, Option B, Equation 1c). The only adjustments that 
will be made to baseline or reporting period energy use will be for additions or deletions to the 
system and for burnouts found to be more than 3% at any time.

A non-routine adjustment was made immediately to account for reducing the burnout rate from 
the baseline period’s 20% to the Retail Chain A reporting-period value of 3.0%. The baseline-energy was 
therefore adjusted to 2,130,000 kWh ( = 1,753,000 x 0.970 / 0.800).   
The city staff will monitor burnout rates monthly. If the burnout rate is greater than 3.0%, a non-
routine adjustment will be made to bring reporting-period metered data up to the contracted 
3.0% burnout rate.  
Savings will be reported for the length of the 10-year guarantee period using a single price of 
0.600 kuna/kWh. 
Results  Savings were reported without adjustment for the first three years after retrofit because 
burnout rates remained above 3.0%.   
For the fourth year the burnout rate was 5.0% for 7 months. Fourth year savings were computed 
as follows:

A-4  Compressed-Air Leakage Management – Option B 
Situation  A Brazilian auto manufacturer’s plant engineering department estimated that 
R$200,000 per year was being lost through compressed-air leakage arising from poor 
maintenance. The plant engineer persuaded the plant manager that the maintenance 
department should dedicate one person for two months to repair all leaks. The engineering 
department agreed to conduct ongoing monitoring of leakage rates and savings, in order to 
motivate the maintenance staff to regularly check for leakage. 
Factors Affecting M&V Design  There are very few funds available for any M&V activity. Also 
the engineering department wished any savings measurement methodology to have a 
maximum quantifiable error of ±5% in any reported savings, with a confidence level of 95%. 
The plant operates with 2 shifts per day, 10 per week and 442 per year. When it is operating, it's 
use of compressed air is steady. Heat from compressors is rejected directly outside compressor 
rooms without impacting any other plant energy-using systems. 
The local electric consumption rate (known as the “green rate”) for low-load-factor commercial 
accounts over 0.5 MW is shown in Table A-4-1.

It was assumed that the impact on plant electrical demand would be minimal since it is likely 
that there will be no change in the maximum number of compressors that will function during 
plant operations.  
M&V Plan  A full M&V Plan is shown on EVO’s subscriber website (www.evo-world.org). It uses 
IPMVP Volume I, EVO 10000 – 1:2012, Option B, for ongoing measurement of savings to 
indicate changes in compressed-air leakage rates. IPMVP Equation 1b) was used to adjust 
baseline energy to reporting period conditions. The M&V Plan aimed to minimize extra 
measurement costs so a simple three-phase true-rms wattmeter was added to the electrical 
supply of the motor-control center feeding all equipment in the compressor room. This 
measurement boundary encompassed 6 compressors, 3 compressed-air driers, and all other 
minor auxiliary systems in the compressor room. Heat generated within the compressor room is 
not an interactive effect since it does not affect any other energy uses. Plant staff were 
instructed to read the meter at the end of each shift (i.e. three times a day) whether the plant 
was operating or not. The meter was installed three months before leak-management activities 
began.  
The static factors related to plant design and operations were listed, as a reference for any 
future possible non-routine adjustments.  They included the number, capacity and usage 
patterns of all compressed-air-driven equipment, plant production-line speed, and vehicle 
models being produced. 
The baseline period electricity use, for operating and non-operating shifts, were quite different. 
Also within either kind of shift there were slight variations in energy use. No specific 
independent variable could be identified to account for the variations. It was decided to use the 
mean energy use of each kind of shift in the baseline period for determining the savings. A 
criterion was established for determining when sufficient readings had been made of baseline 
energy per shift to meet the Retail Chain A 95/5 uncertainty Retail Chain A for any savings report. 
Results  A full set of savings results are shown on the EVO subscriber website. It was found 
that to meet the 95/5 uncertainty criterion, the variation in shift energy during the baseline 
required readings for a seven-week period before retrofit. The baseline values were therefore 
established as the seven-week average electricity use of operating and non-operating shifts. 
It was noted that after the leakage repair activity was completed there was much less variation 
in the reporting-period energy use per shift.  Therefore the uncertainty Retail Chain A could be met by 
monthly savings reports.  
Energy savings were computed as the difference between actual energy use every month and 
the adjusted-baseline energy determined by multiplying the number of actual shifts in the month 
by the baseline mean energy use for each type of shift.  
The appropriate price of electricity was applied to the consumption savings, assuming that the 
utility’s “peak period” rates only applied to three hours within the second shift.  No demand 
savings were calculated.   
These measurements continued as part of normal plant operations. The plant-engineering 
department adjusted the baseline energy periodically as static factors changed. Operating staff 
provided shift energy readings and the engineering department reported savings every month. 
Variations from past savings patterns became a focus for assessing the maintenance practices 
related to the compressed-air system. 
A-5  Turbine/Generator Set Improvement – Option B 
Situation  A pulp mill used a steam turbine to generate much of its own electricity. Recent 
process changes had reduced the available steam for the turbine-generator (TG) unit from its 
original design level. As a result electricity output and thermal efficiency of the TG unit was 
reduced. The mill installed a new more efficient rotor designed for the new smaller steam flow. A

measurement process was put in place for assessing the increased electrical output in order to 
qualify for an electric-utility incentive payment.  
Factors Affecting The M&V Design  The purpose of the M&V was to report electrical 
improvements. The mill recognized that extraction of more energy by the turbine left less steam 
energy for the process, or required more boiler energy to deliver the same steam to the process. 
These interactive effects were not part of this analysis for the electrical utility. The utility 
incentive was based purely on increased electricity production. 
M&V Plan  The mill and the utility agreed to use IPMVP Volume I, EVO 10000 – 1:2012, Option 
B to determine the increase in electricity output for a one year period. Existing plant 
instrumentation was used to determine the efficiency of the old rotor as shown in Figure A-5.1. 
 
  
The mathematical model describing the baseline unit efficiency was found by regression 
analysis to be: 
 
Efficiency (%) = (-0.000247 x flow2) + (0.255 x flow) + 14.5 
This efficiency model will be used with the steam conditions of the one-year reporting period to 
determine what the electricity production would have been with the old rotor. Increased 
electricity production will be reported under reporting-period conditions, using IPMVP Equation 
1b). 
Existing plant meters are regularly calibrated as part of plant maintenance. They were deemed 
to be suitable for the utility’s purpose. 
Results  For a year after retrofit, the steam conditions every minute were applied to the 
mathematical model of old rotor efficiency to compute the adjusted-baseline energy term used

in IPMVP Equation 1b). This value was compared to actually measured generation for the same 
period to determine the increase in electrical output. 
No changes happened to the TG unit during this year, so non-routine adjustments were 
unnecessary.   
A-6  Boiler Efficiency Improvement – Option A 
Situation  A boiler contractor replaced a German office building’s existing boiler with a more 
efficient boiler. The contractor guaranteed annual oil savings of at least €25,000, assuming the 
loads on the boiler were the same as he measured during the baseline period. The owner’s 
purchase order specified that holdback amounts would be paid only after the contractor 
presented a  savings report adhering to IPMVP Volume I, EVO 10000 – 1:2012. It was also 
specified that the owner and contractor would agree to the M&V Plan as part of the final design 
plans for the retrofit. 
Factors Affecting M&V Design   Numerous building changes were going on at the time of the 
boiler plant revision, so boiler plant loads were expected to change. The contractor is only 
responsible for boiler efficiency improvements, not changes in boiler load. The boiler is the only 
equipment in the building using oil. The price of oil to be used for proof of achieving the 
performance guarantee was €0.70/liter. 
M&V Plan  IPMVP Volume I, EVO 10000 – 1:2012, Option A was chosen to isolate the boiler 
from the changes going on in the rest of the building. The measurement boundary was drawn to 
include only the boiler, measuring fuel use and net thermal energy delivered to the building. This 
boundary excludes the electricity use of the boiler’s burner and blower. Changes to these 
electrical interactive effects were regarded as negligible, and not worth inclusion within the 
measurement boundary or even separate estimation.  
The contractor’s guarantee was stated relative to the usage of the year before submission of its 
proposal. During that period, the facility purchased 241,300 liters of heating oil for the boiler. 
There was a 2,100 liter increase in oil inventory between the beginning and end of that year. 
Therefore actual consumption was 239,200 liters. The energy load on the boiler will be 
determined from this oil-use data, once the efficiency of the old boiler is established. IPMVP 
Equation 1d) will be used with 239,200 liters as the estimate. This estimate has no error, since 
most of it27 comes from oil shipment data, which is the reference source with no error. 
Boiler efficiency will be the measured parameter in Equation 1d). Efficiency tests were planned 
for a period of typical winter conditions before removing the old boiler. Winter conditions were 
chosen so that there was sufficient load to assess efficiency under the full range of boiler loads. 
A recently calibrated thermal energy meter was installed by the contractor on the boiler supply 
and return water lines and a calibrated oil meter installed on the fuel supply to the boiler. Both 
the oil meter and the thermal-energy meter and data logger have manufacturers’ rated 
precisions of ±2% for the ranges involved in this project.  
Baseline efficiency tests were conducted over three separate one-week periods when daily 
mean ambient temperatures ranged from -5oC to +5oC. Identical tests were planned for the first 
period after commissioning of the new boiler when ambient temperatures are once again in the -
5oC to +5oC range, using the same oil and thermal energy meters left in place since the baseline 
efficiency tests. Since the three individual one-week tests are expected to include periods 
                                                  
27 Oil inventory levels are read from an un-calibrated tank gauge of unknown accuracy. Since the magnitude of 
inventory adjustments are small relative to metered shipments for the year, any error in this inventory term were 
considered negligible.

representing a range of boiler loads, from low to high, it was agreed that the test results will 
adequately represent the annual improvement that the owner could expect.  
Oil and thermal energy meter readings will be made daily by building maintenance staff through 
winter months until three valid weeks of testing have been obtained for the old boiler. The same 
process will be followed for the new boiler. The readings will be logged in the boiler room and 
open for inspection at any time. The building-automation system measures and records ambient 
temperature for the valid weeks. 
A contract extra of €5,100 was accepted by the owner for the supply, installation and 
commissioning of the oil and thermal-energy meters and for computing and reporting the 
savings. Consideration was given to requiring demonstration of performance for a whole year. 
However the contractor pointed out that the extra costs of meter calibration and data analysis 
would add €3,000 to the fee. The owner decided that a short test period of 3 representative 
weeks would be adequate. The owner also decided to maintain and calibrate the oil and thermal 
energy meters himself after the contract, and to annually make his own boiler-efficiency 
calculations. 
Results  Baseline oil and thermal energy data was collected continuously over a five-week 
period, until three were found where daily mean ambient temperatures stayed within the 
specified range -5oC to +5oC. Dividing net thermal energy delivered by oil consumed, the 
average efficiency readings for the old boiler during the three one-week periods were found to 
be 65.2%.  
After installation and commissioning of the boiler, the three-week reporting period was again 
found with an average ambient temperature between -5oC to +5oC. Boiler efficiency test results 
averaged 80.6%.  
There were no other changes to the boiler plant between the time of the baseline-period tests 
and reporting-period tests. Therefore non-routine adjustments were not needed. 
Using IPMVP Equation 1d), annual savings using 239,200 liters as the estimated annual oil use 
from the baseline period are: 
 
 
Oil savings  
= 239,200 liters x ( 1.000 – 0.652 / 0.806 ) 
 
 
 
 
= 45,700 liters 
The value of the savings is €0.70 x 45,700 = €31,900.28 
These estimated annual savings from a short-term test validated that the contractor had met its 
guaranteed performance. 
A-7  Multiple ECM With Metered Baseline Data – Option C 
Situation  An energy efficiency project was implemented in a high school in northern United 
States. It involved ten ECMs spanning lighting, HVAC, pool heating, operator training and 
occupant-awareness campaigns. The objectives of the project were to reduce energy costs. 
Factors Affecting M&V Design  The owner wished to record annual cost avoidance relative to 
the conditions and energy usage rate of 2005 as the baseline. The school contained a pool and 
cafeteria.  The school is in use year round, though it closes for a total of 5 weeks a year 
between sessions. The community uses the building most evenings. 
The building’s energy requirement is significantly affected by ambient temperature. Temperature 
data can be easily obtained from a nearby government weather office. No other significant 
energy-governing variable could be quantified. 
                                                  
28 The annual oil and money savings are expressed conservatively with three significant digits, the lowest number of 
digits used in the computations as found in the efficiency tests.

Only administration offices have mechanical air-conditioning equipment, which operates for 3 
months of the year. 
Expected annual savings on the gas meter are 2,800 mcf, and 380,000 kWh on the main 
electricity meter. 
M&V Plan  An M&V Plan was developed showing that IPMVP Volume I, EVO 10000 – 1:2012, 
Option C was to be used for savings determination because total facility energy cost was the 
focus. Option C was also chosen because many ECMs were involved, some of which could not 
be directly measured.  
Since savings are to be reported as “cost avoidance,” i.e. under reporting period conditions, 
Equation 1b) will be used.  
An outline of key elements in the M&V Plan is shown below. Details, data and analysis are 
shown on the EVO subscribers’ website (www.evo-world.org). 
 
The measurement boundary of this savings determination was defined as: 
o An electricity account, including demand, serving the main building, 
o An auxiliary electrical account, without demand, serving lighting in the field house, 
o A natural gas account for the main building. 
 
The 2005 baseline conditions were recorded, including a strategy for the engineering 
department to easily capture information about future changes.  
 
The baseline period’s energy data and weather data were recorded and analyzed by simple 
linear regression of monthly energy use and energy demand against degree days. Degree-
day data was with the base temperature, which yielded the best R2 from a number of 
regression analyses performed over a range of plausible base temperatures.  
 
Preliminary analysis found clear correlations with weather for winter gas use and winter 
electricity consumption on the main meter. Analysis also showed that there is no significant 
weather correlation with electric demand, summer gas or electricity use. It was decided that 
regression would only be performed on billing periods with more than 50 heating degree 
days (HDD). It was also decided that for reporting periods with 50 or fewer HDDs, adjusted-
baseline values would be derived directly from the corresponding baseline month, adjusted 
solely for the number of days in the period.  
The energy/HDD relationships were derived for the heating season on all three accounts as 
shown in Table A-7-1, along with key regression statistics and coefficients where significant 
relationships were found.

The regression statistics for the gas consumption and main electricity consumption show 
acceptable correlation with HDD as indicated by the high R2, and the HDD t-statistics being well 
above the critical IPMVP Table B-1 value of 1.89 for 8 data points and 90% confidence. These 
observations are logical since the primary use of gas is for building heating. There is also a 
significant amount of electric heat in the main building. 
The field house account showed a poor t-statistic and R2. The building has no installed heating 
but must be lit longer in months of less daylight, which are also colder months. Monthly 
electricity use could be expected to follow a reasonably regular annual pattern related to 
daylight hours and occupancy, not driven by ambient temperature. Therefore the minimal 
correlation of this meter with HDD is ignored, and there will be no weather adjustments made to 
it. Instead, each month’s savings report will take its baseline energy from the corresponding 
baseline month’s consumption, adjusting for the number of days in the reporting period. 
The main electrical-demand meter showed a poor correlation with the coldest day’s weather. 
Therefore each month’s savings report will take its baseline demand from the corresponding 
baseline month’s actual demand, without adjustment. 
 
The long term impact on savings reports of these regression statistics was analyzed. The 
relative precision in winter savings reports will be less than ±10% for gas and less than 
±20% for the main electricity account. The expected savings will be statistically significant 
for winter months since they will be more than twice the standard error of the baseline 
formulae (see criterion in Appendix B-1.2). The school officials felt comfortable with this 
expected quantified precision, and with possible unquantifiable errors related to simply 
adjusting for metering period lengths in months with 50 or fewer HDD.  
 
The utility rates to be used in valuing savings will be the then current full-price schedule 
appropriate for each account. 
Results  The reporting-period data for the first year was taken directly from utility bills without 
adjustment, and from government weather reports. This data and the calculations for the 
savings in energy and demand units, using Equation 1b), are shown on EVO’s website.   
Each month’s current utility rate schedule was applied to each account’s adjusted-baseline 
energy and reporting-period energy to compute savings. Since the gas rate changed in month 9 
and the electric rate changed in month 7, two different price schedules were used for each 
commodity during the 12-month savings report. These computations are also detailed on the 
EVO website.  
A-7.1  Whole-Facility Energy Accounting Relative To Budget 
Situation  The energy manager of a chain of hotels was required to annually prepare an energy 
budget, and routinely account for variances from budget. 
Factors Affecting M&V Design  Hotel guest-room occupancy, convention-area usage and 
weather significantly affect energy use.  In order to account for energy use, the energy manager 
realized she needed to use M&V style techniques to adjust for these significant factors. 
M&V Plan  The energy manager followed IPMVP Volume I, EVO 10000 – 1:2012, Option C, 
since she needed to explain budget variances in management accounting reports. She always

## Page 182

82        Appendix A Examples 
 
stated her energy budgets under long-term average weather conditions and the previous year’s 
occupancy.  
Results  In order to account for budget variances, as soon as a year was complete, the energy 
manager prepared a regression model of the usage on each utility account, using actual 
weather and occupancy factors for that year. She then took three steps to separately determine 
the primary effects of weather, occupancy and utility rates: 
 
Weather She inserted normal weather statistics into the most recent year’s models. Using 
actual utility rates for the year, she determined how much the energy (and cost) would have 
been if the weather had been normal. (She also noted how much the actual heating and 
cooling degree days varied from normal, and from the previous year, at each location.) 
 
Occupancy She inserted the occupancy factors of the previous year into the most recent 
year’s models. Using actual utility rates for the recent year, she determined how much the 
energy (and cost) would have been if the occupancy had been the same as the previous 
year. (She also noted how much the occupancy had changed from year to year at each 
location.) 
 
Utility Rates She applied the previous year’s utility rate to the most recent year’s 
consumption (and demand) to determine how much of the budget variance was related to 
rate changes for each utility at each location. 
With the impact of these three known variables defined, the energy manager still needed to 
account for the remaining variances. So she inserted the recent year’s weather and occupancy 
factors into the mathematical models of the previous year, and using current utility rates 
reported cost avoidance from the previous year’s pattern. This cost avoidance was then 
analyzed in relation to changes in static factors recorded for each site relative to the previous 
year’s record.  All remaining variance was reported as truly random, or unknown phenomena.   
This analysis process not only allowed the energy manager to account for budget variances, it 
also informed her of where to focus efforts to manage unaccounted variances. In addition it 
allowed her to make more informed budgets for subsequent years. 
A-8  Multiple ECMs In A Building Without Energy Meters In The Baseline 
Period – Option D  
Situation  An energy efficiency project was implemented in an American university library 
building, involving seven ECMs spanning lighting, HVAC, operator training and occupant 
awareness campaigns. The building is part of a multiple-building campus without individual 
building meters. The objectives of the project were to reduce energy costs in the library. 
Factors Affecting The M&V Design  Since the project at the library was very small relative to 
the entire campus, its effect could not be measured using the main campus utility meters. 
The university wished to achieve savings as quickly as possible, despite the lack of a baseline 
energy record.  
Savings are to be reported continuously, as soon as possible after retrofit, using the then 
current energy contract prices. 
M&V Plan  It was decided not to wait to obtain a year’s worth of energy data from new meters 
before implementing the measures.  Instead IPMVP Volume I, EVO 10000 – 1:2012, Option D, 
Equation 1f) would be used, simulating pre-retrofit performance. Therefore, as part of the 
energy-management program steam, electricity and electric demand meters were installed on 
the main supply lines to the library.   
The measurement boundary of this project was defined as all energy-using systems in the 
library. However the important energy effect was at the main campus utility meters. To

Appendix A Examples         83 
 
transform energy measured at the library to its actual impact on the campus utility bills, the 
following assumptions were made: 
 
A pound of steam at the library requires 1.5 ft3 of natural gas at the campus heating plant’s 
gas meter. There is a fixed component in the gas use of the central plant, arising from the 
standing losses of the steam system. The 1.5 ft3 factor, an annual average of gas use per 
pound of steam produced, allocates a load-based share of this fixed component to the 
library.  
 
Electricity use at the library requires 3% more electricity at the campus electricity meter 
because of estimated campus transformer and distribution losses. 
 
Peak electric demand at the library is assumed to be coincident with the time of peak 
demand at the campus meter. 
The expected savings of the ECMs were predicted by computer simulation with the publicly 
available DOE 2.1 software. A full survey of the building’s systems and occupancy was needed 
to gather all the input data. The power requirements of five variable-air-volume air-handling 
systems were logged for one week to define some of the input data for this planning simulation. 
The simulation used long-term normal weather conditions and the occupancy and other building 
characteristics that prevailed at the time of the prediction. It was decided to report actual 
savings under the same conditions.  
The university’s gas supply contract has a marginal unit price of US$6.25/mcf.  It also has a 
minimum consumption level, which is only 5,300 mcf below the actual gas usage during the 
baseline period. If consumption drops by more than 5,300 mcf, the university will pay for the 
contract minimum amount. The contract will be renegotiated based on the results determined 
from this library project. The marginal electricity price at the campus meter is $0.18/kWh in peak 
periods, $0.05/kWh in off peak periods and demand is priced at $10.25/kW-month. 
Following the first year, the first year’s meter data will be used as a baseline for a new Option C 
approach for this building. 
Results  The following steps were used to compute savings. 
1. The new meters were calibrated and installed. Operating staff recorded monthly energy and 
demand for 12 months throughout the first year after ECM commissioning. 
2. Then the original planning simulation model was refined to match: the ECMs as installed, 
the weather, the occupancy, and the operating profiles of the reporting period. The resultant 
simulation of space temperatures and humidities were examined to ensure they reasonably 
matched the typical range of indoor conditions during occupied and unoccupied days. 
Initially the simulation result did not match actual energy use very well, so the M&V team 
investigated the site further. During these additional investigations the team found that 
unoccupied night periods experienced very little indoor temperature change. Therefore they 
changed the thermal-mass characteristics of the computer model. After this correction the 
modeled monthly results were compared to the monthly calibration data. The highest 
CV(RMSE) of the differences was 12%, on the electric demand meter. The university felt 
that because these CV(RMSE) values met ASHRAE (2002) specifications, it could have 
reasonable confidence in the relative results of two runs of the model.  Therefore this 
“calibrated as-built model” was archived, with both printed and electronic copy of input data, 
diagnostic reports and output data.

normal year.  Occupancy statistics and static factors were also reset to what had been 
observed during the baseline period. The resultant “post-retrofit normal-conditions

A-9  New Building Designed Better Than Code – Option D 
Situation  A new building was designed to use less energy than required by the local building 
code. In order to qualify for a government incentive payment, the owner was required to show 
that the building’s energy use during the first year of operation after commissioning and full 
occupancy was less than 60% of what it would have been if it had been built to code.

Factors Affecting M&V Design  Computer simulation was used extensively throughout the 
building design process to help meet a Retail Chain A energy use equal to 50% of code.  
The building was built as the new corporate headquarters for a large firm. It was expected that 
the building would become fully occupied immediately after opening.  
The owner wished to use the same energy-savings calculations that he presents to the 
government to show how much money was being saved as a result of his extra investment in an 
efficient building. He also wished to annually review variances from his initially achieved energy 
performance. 
M&V Plan   IMPVP Volume I, EVO 10000 – 1:2012, Option D will be used to demonstrate the 
new building’s savings compared to an identical building built to building-code standards. It is 
possible to use either Equation 1f) comparing two simulations, or Equation 1g) comparing the 
simulated baseline energy and measured actual energy after correcting for calibration error. The 
incentive program did not specify which method should be used. The person performing the 
modeling felt that Equation 1f) would be more accurate. However the owner wished to use 
actual utility data in his final savings statement, so he required the use of Equation 1g).30 
Following the first year of full operation (“year one”), year one’s energy and operational data will 
become the baseline for an IPMVP Volume I, EVO 10000 – 1:2012, Option C approach to 
reporting ongoing performance. 
Results  A year after commissioning and full occupancy, the original design simulation’s input 
data was updated to reflect the as-built equipment and the current occupancy. A weather-data 
file was chosen from available weather files for the building’s location based on the file’s 
similarity of total heating and cooling degree days with year one’s measured degree days. This 
similar file was appropriately adjusted to year one’s actual monthly heating and cooling degree 
days. The revised input data was used to rerun the simulation. 
The utility consumption data from year one was compared to this simulation model. After some 
further revisions to the simulation’s input data, it was deemed that the simulation reasonably 
modeled the current building. This calibrated simulation was called the “as-built model.” 
The calibration error in the as-built model relative to actual utility data is shown in Table A-9-1.

The input data for the as-built model was then changed to describe a building with the same 
occupancy and location but which simply meets the building-code standard. This was called the 
“standard model.” 
The standard model’s monthly predicted energy use was adjusted by the monthly calibration 
errors in Table A-9-1 to yield the “corrected-standard model.” Actual metered data for year 
one was then subtracted from the corrected-standard model to yield the monthly savings. 
Percentage savings were computed to prove eligibility for the government incentive.  
Monetary savings were determined for the owner by applying the then current full utility rate 
structure to the corrected standard model’s predicted monthly amounts. This total value was 
compared to the total utility payments for year one. 
The year one energy data became the basis for an Option C approach for subsequent years.

APPENDIX B   UNCERTAINTY 
B-1   Introduction 
The objective of M&V is to reliably determine energy savings. In order for savings reports to be 
reliable, they need to have a reasonable level of uncertainty. The uncertainty of a savings report 
can be managed by controlling random errors and data bias. Random errors are affected by the 
quality of the measurement equipment, the measurement techniques, and the design of the 
sampling procedure. Data bias is affected by the quality of measurement data, assumptions and 
analysis. Reducing errors usually increases M&V cost so the need for improved uncertainty 
should be justified by the value of the improved information (see Chapter 8.5). 
Energy savings computations involve a comparison of measured energy data, and a calculation 
of “adjustments” to convert both measurements to the same set of operating conditions (see 
Chapter 4.1, Equation 1). Both the measurements and the adjustments introduce error. Errors 
may arise for example due to meter inaccuracy, sampling procedures or adjustment procedures. 
These processes produce statistical “estimates” with reported or expected values, and some 
level of variation. In other words, true values are not known, only estimates with some level of 
uncertainty. All physical measurement and statistical analysis is based on estimation of central 
tendencies, such as mean values, and quantification of variations such as range, standard 
deviation, standard error, and variance.  
Statistics is the body of mathematical methods that can be applied to data to help make 
decisions in the face of uncertainty. For example, statistics provide ways of checking results to 
see if the reported savings are “significant,” i.e. likely to be a real effect of the ECM rather than 
random behavior.  
Errors occur in three ways: modeling, sampling, and measurement:  
 
Modeling.  Errors in mathematical modeling due to inappropriate functional form, inclusion of 
irrelevant variables, exclusion of relevant variables, etc. See Appendix B-2. 
 
Sampling.  Sampling error arises when only a portion of the population of actual values is 
measured, or a biased sampling approach is used. Representation of only a portion of the 
population may occur in either a physical sense (i.e., only 20 of 1,000 light fixtures are 
metered), or in the time sense (metering occurring for only ten minutes out of every hour). 
See Appendix B-3. 
 
Measurement.  Measurement errors arise from the accuracy of sensors, data tracking 
errors, drift since calibration, imprecise measurements, etc. The magnitude of such errors is 
largely given by manufacturer's specifications and managed by periodic re-calibration. See 
Appendix B-4, and Chapters 4.8.3 and 8.11. 
This Appendix gives guidance on quantifying the uncertainties created by these three forms of 
error. Appendix B-5 discusses methods of combining quantified elements of uncertainty. 
Some sources of error are unknown and unquantifiable. Examples of such sources are poor 
meter selection or placement, inaccurate estimates in Option A, or mis-estimation of interactive 
effects in Options A or B. Unknown or unquantifiable uncertainties can only be managed by 
following industry best practices. 
An example of the use of uncertainty analysis is given in Appendix B-6. Also some of the 
examples in Appendix A present uncertainty calculations: A-3, A-3-2, A-4 and A-7. EVO’s 
subscriber website (www.evo-world.org) contains details of the uncertainty calculations in A-4 
and A-7.

B-1.1   Expressing Uncertainty 
In order to communicate savings in a statistically valid manner, savings need to be expressed 
along with their associated confidence and precision levels. Confidence refers to the likelihood 
or probability that the estimated savings will fall within the precision range.31 For example, the 
savings estimation process may lead to a statement such as: “the best estimate of savings is 
1,000 kWh annually (point estimate) with a 90% probability (confidence) that the true-average 
savings value falls within ±20% of 1,000.” A graphical presentation of this relationship is shown 
in Figure B-1.

true average savings 
falls between 800 and 
1,200
 
A statistical precision statement (the ±20% portion) without a confidence level (the 90% portion) 
is meaningless. The M&V process may yield extremely high precision with low confidence. For 
example, the savings may be stated with a precision of ±1%, but the associated confidence 
level may drop from 95% to 35%.   
B-1.2   Acceptable Uncertainty 
Savings are deemed to be statistically valid if they are large relative to the statistical variations. 
Specifically, the savings need to be larger than twice the standard error (see definition in 
Appendix B-1.3) of the baseline value. If the variance of the baseline data is excessive, the 
unexplained random behavior in energy use of the facility or system is high, and any single 
savings determination is unreliable.  
Where you cannot meet this criterion, consider using: 
 
more precise measurement equipment,  
 
more independent variables in any mathematical model,  
 
larger sample sizes, or  
 
an IPMVP Option that is less affected by unknown variables.

B-1.3   Definitions of Statistical Terms 
Sample Mean (Y ): The most widely used measure of the central tendency of a series of 
observations. Sample mean is determined by adding up the individual data points (Yi) and 
dividing by the total number of these data points (n), as follows:

Sample Variance (S2): Sample variance measures the extent to which observed values differ 
from each other, i.e., variability or dispersion. The greater the variability, the greater the 
uncertainty in the mean. Sample variance, the most important measure of variability, is found by 
averaging the squares of the individual deviations from the mean. The reason these deviations 
from the mean are squared is simply to eliminate the negative values (when a value is below the 
mean) so they do not cancel out the positive values (when a value is above the mean). Sample 
variance is computed as follows:

Sample Standard Deviation (s): This is simply the square root of the sample variance. This 
brings the variability measure back to the units of the data (e.g., if the variance units are (kWh)2, 
the standard deviation units would be kWh).

Sample Standard Error (SE): This is the sample standard deviation divided by

"sample standard deviation of the mean" in most statistics textbooks.

B-4 
 
Sample Standard Deviation of the Total (stot):  Many times we are interested in the statistical 
properties of a total rather than a mean.  The sample standard deviation of a total is used to 
define the precision about a sample total.  It is defined as the square root of the sample size, 
, times the sample standard deviation: 
 
 
 
B-5 
Coefficent of Variation (cv):  The coefficient of variation is simply the standard deviation of a 
distribution expressed as a percentage of the mean.  For instance, the cv of a sample total

Precision: Precision is the measure of the absolute or relative range within which the true value 
is expected to occur with some specified level of confidence. Confidence level refers to the 
probability that the quoted range contains the estimated parameter.   
Absolute precision is computed from sample standard error using a “t” value from the “t-
distribution” Table B-1:

observations is 1,000 ±7.7%. Similarly it could be said: 
 
with 95% confidence that the mean value of the 12 observations is 1,000 ±9.5%, or 


 
with 50% confidence that the mean value of the 12 observations is 1,000 ±3.0%. 
B-2   Modeling 
Mathematical modeling is used in M&V to prepare the routine-adjustments term in the various 
versions of Equation 1 in Chapter 4. Modeling involves finding a mathematical relationship 
between dependent and independent variables. The dependent variable, usually energy, is 
modeled as being governed by one or more independent variable(s) Xi, (also known as 
‘explanatory’ variables). This type of modeling is called regression analysis.  
In regression analysis, the model attempts to “explain” the variation in energy resulting from 
variations in the individual independent variables (Xi). For example, if one of the X’s is 
production level, the model would assess whether the variation of energy from its mean is 
caused by changes in production level. The model quantifies the causation. For example, when 
production increases by one unit, energy consumption increases by “b” units, where “b” is called 
the regression coefficient.   
The most common models are linear regressions of the form:  
 
 
 
 
Y = bo + b1X1 + b2X2 + ….. + bpXp + e 
 
where: 
 
 
Y is the dependent variable, usually in the form of energy use during a specific time period 
(e.g., 30 days, 1 week, 1 day, 1 hour, etc.) 
 
Xit (i = 1, 2, 3, … p) represents the ‘p’ independent variables such as weather, production, 
occupancy, metering period length, etc. 
 
bi (i = 0, 1, 2, … p) represents the coefficients derived for each independent variable, and 
one fixed coefficient (b0) unrelated to the independent variables 
 
e represents the residual errors that remain unexplained after accounting for the impact of 
the various independent  variables. Regression analysis finds the set of bi values that 
minimizes the sum of squared residual-error terms (thus regression models are also called 
least-squares models).   
An example of the above model for a building’s energy use is:

## Page 193

 
Appendix B Uncertainty         93 
 
   monthly energy consumption = 342,000 + (63 x HDD) + (103 x CDD) + (222 x Occupancy) 
 
HDD and CDD are heating and cooling degree days, respectively. Occupancy is a measure of 
percent occupancy in the building. In this model 342,000 is an estimate of baseload in kWh, 63 
measures the change in consumption for one additional HDD, 103 measures the change in 
consumption for one additional CDD, and 222 measures the change in consumption per 1% 
change in occupancy. 
Appendix B-6 presents an example of a regression analysis report for a single independent 
variable, from common spreadsheet software. 
B-2.1   Modeling Errors 
When using regression models, as described above, several types of errors may be introduced 
as listed below. 
1. The model is built on values that are outside the probable range of the variables to be used. 
A mathematical model should only be constructed using reasonable values of the 
dependent and independent variables. 
2. The mathematical model may not include relevant independent variables, introducing the 
possibility of biased relationships (omitted variable bias). 
3. The model may include some variables that are irrelevant. 
4. The model may use inappropriate functional form. 
5. The model may be based on insufficient or unrepresentative data. 
Each of these types of modeling errors is discussed below. 
B-2.1.1   Using Out of Range Data 
If the model is built on data that are not representative of the normal energy behavior of the 
facility, then the predictions may not be relied upon. This may include inclusion of outliers, or 
values that are well outside the range of reasonableness. Data should be screened before 
building the model. 
B-2.1.2   Omission of Relevant Variables 
In M&V, regression analysis is used to account for changes in energy use. Most complex 
energy using systems are affected by innumerable independent variables. Regression models 
cannot hope to include all independent variables. Even if it were possible, the model would be 
too complex to be useful and would require excessive data gathering activities. The practical 
approach is to include only independent variable(s) thought to significantly impact energy.  
Omission of a relevant independent variable may be an important error. The example model in 
Appendix B-2 tries to explain the variations in monthly energy use using several X variables. If a 
relevant independent variable is missing (e.g., HDD), then the model will fail to account for a 
significant portion of the variation in energy. The deficient model will also attribute some of the 
variation that is due to the missing variable to the variable(s) that are included in the model. The 
effect will be a less accurate model. .  
There are no obvious indications of this problem in the standard statistical tests (except maybe 
a low R2, see B-2.2.1 below). Experience and knowledge of the engineering of the system 
whose performance is being measured is most valuable here.  
There may be cases where a relationship is known to exist with a variable recorded during the 
baseline period. However the variable is not included in the model due to lack of budget to 
continue to gather the data in the reporting period. Such omission of a relevant variable should 
be noted and justified in the M&V Plan.

B-2.1.3   Inclusion of Irrelevant Variables  
Sometimes models include irrelevant independent variable(s). If the irrelevant variable has no 
relationship (correlation) with the included relevant variables, then it will have minimal impact on 
the model. However, if the irrelevant variable is correlated with other relevant variables in the 
model, it may bias the coefficients of the relevant variables.  
Use caution in adding more independent variables into a regression analysis just because they 
are available. To judge the relevance of independent variables requires both experience and 
intuition. However, the associated t-statistic (see B-2.2.3 below) is one way of confirming the 
relevance of particular independent variables included in a model. Experience in energy 
analysis for the type of facility involved in any M&V program is is necessary to determine the 
relevance of independent variables. 
B-2.1.4   Functional Form 
It is possible to model a relationship using the incorrect functional form. For example, a linear 
relationship might be incorrectly used in modeling an underlying physical relationship that is 
non-linear. For example, electricity consumption and ambient temperature tend to have a non-
linear (often ‘U’ shaped) relationship with outdoor temperature over a one-year period in 
buildings that are both heated and cooled electrically. (Electricity use is high for both low and 
high ambient temperatures, while relatively low in mid seasons.) Modeling this non-linear 
relationship with a single linear model would introduce unnecessary error. Instead, separate 
linear models should be derived for each season.  
It may also be appropriate to try higher order relationships, e.g., Y = f(X, X2, X3).   
The modeler needs to assess different functional forms and select the most appropriate among 
them using the evaluation measures presented in Appendix B-2.2, below. 
B-2.1.5   Data Shortage 
Errors may also occur from insufficient data either in terms of quantity (i.e., too few data points) 
or time (e.g., using summer months in the model and trying to extrapolate to winter months). 
The data used in modeling should be representative of the range of operations of the facility. 
The time period covered by the model needs to include various possible seasons, types of use, 
etc. This may call for either extension of the time periods used or increasing sample sizes.  
B-2.2   Evaluating Regression Models 
In order to evaluate how well a particular regression model explains the relationship between 
energy use and independent variable(s), three tests may be performed as described below.  
Appendix B-6 provides evaluation of an example regression model. 
B-2.2.1   Coefficient of Determination (R2) 
The first step in assessing the accuracy of a model is to examine the Coefficient of 
Determination, R2, a measure of the extent to which variations in the dependent variable Y from 
its mean value are explained by the regression model. Mathematically, R2 is:

 
Y  = mean of the n measured energy values, found using equation B-1 
 
Yi = actual observed (e.g., using a meter) value of energy  
All statistical packages and spreadsheet regression-analysis tools compute the value of R2. 
The range of possible values for R2 is 0.0 to 1.0.  An R2 of 0.0 means none of the variation is 
explained by the model, therefore the model provides no guidance in understanding the 
variations in Y (i.e., the selected independent variable(s) give no explanation of the causes of 
the observed variations in Y). On the other hand, an R2 of 1.0 means the model explains 100% 
of the variations in Y, (i.e., the model predicts Y with total certainty, for any given set of values of 
the independent variable(s)). Neither of these limiting values of R2 is likely with real data.  
In general, the greater the coefficient of determination, the better the model describes the 
relationship of the independent variables and the dependent variable. Though there is no 
universal standard for a minimum acceptable R2 value, 0.75 is often considered a reasonable 
indicator of a good causal relationship amongst the energy and independent variables. 
The R2 test should only be used as an initial check. Models should not be rejected or accepted 
solely on the basis of R2. Finally, a low R2 is an indication that some relevant variable(s) are not 
included, or that the functional form of the model (e.g., linear) is not appropriate. In this situation 
it would be logical to consider additional independent variables or a different functional form.  
B-2.2.2   Standard Error of the Estimate  
When a model is used to predict an energy value (Y) for given independent variable(s), the 
accuracy of the prediction is measured by the standard error of the estimate (SEY). This 
accuracy measure is provided by all standard regression packages and spreadsheets.  
Once the value(s) of independent variable(s) are plugged into the regression model to estimate 
an energy value (Y

This statistic is often referred to as the root-mean squared error (RMSE).

the CV(RMSE).

The MBE is a good indicator of overall bias in the regression estimate. Positive MBE indicates 
that regression estimates tend to overstate the actual values. Overall positive bias does tend to 
cancel out negative bias. The RMSE does not suffer from this cancellation problem.  
All three measures may be used in evaluating the calibration of simulation models in Option D.  
B-2.2.3   t-statistic  
Since regression-model coefficients (bk) are statistical estimates of the true relationship 
between an individual X variable and Y, they are subject to variation. The accuracy of the 
estimate is measured by the standard error of the coefficient and the associated value of the t-
statistic. A t-statistic is a statistical test to determine whether an estimate has statistical 
significance. Once a value is estimated using the test, it can be compared against critical t-
values from a t-table (Table B-1).   
The standard error of each coefficient is computed by regression software. The following 
equation applies for the case of one independent variable.

For cases with more than one independent variable, the equation provides reasonable 
approximation when the independent variables are truly independent (i.e., not correlated). 
Otherwise, the equation gets very complex and the M&V analyst is better off using a software 
package to compute the standard errors of the coefficients.

## Page 197

 
Appendix B Uncertainty         97 
 
The range within which the true value of the coefficient, b falls is found using equation B-8 as: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b ± t x SEb    
 
The standard error of the coefficient, b, also leads to the calculation of the t-statistic. This test 
ultimately determines if the computed coefficient is statistically significant. The t-statistic is 
computed by all statistical software using the following equation: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
t-statistic 
b
SE
b

 
 
B-15 
 
Once the t-statistic is estimated, it can be compared against critical t values from Table B-1. If 
the absolute value of the t-statistic exceeds the appropriate number from Table B-1, then it 
should be concluded that the estimate is statistically valid.  
A rule of thumb states that the absolute value of a t-statistic result of 2 or more implies that the 
estimated coefficient is significant relative to its standard error, and therefore that a relationship 
does exist between Y and the particular X related to the coefficient. It can then be concluded 
that the estimated b is not zero. However, at a t-statistic of about 2, the precision in the value of 
the coefficient is about ±100%: not much of a vote of confidence in the value of b. To obtain a 
better precision of say ±10%, the t-statistic values must be around 20, or the standard error of b 
has to be no more than 0.1 of b itself.  
To improve the t-statistic result: 
 
Select independent variable(s) with the strongest relationship to energy;  
 
Select independent variable(s) whose values span the widest possible range (if X does not 
vary at all in the regression model, b cannot be estimated and the t-statistic will be poor); 
 
Gather and use more data points to develop the model; or 
 
Select a different functional form for the model; for example, one which separately 
determines coefficient(s) for each season in a building that is significantly affected by 
seasonal weather changes.  
B-3   Sampling 
Sampling creates errors because not all units under study are measured. The simplest sampling 
situation is that of randomly selecting n units from a total population of N units. In a random 
sample, each unit has the same probability 

N
n
 of being included in the sample.  
In general, the standard error is inversely proportional to
n .  That is, increasing the sample size 
by a factor “f” will reduce the standard error (improve the precision of the estimate) by a factor of 
f . 
B-3.1   Sample Size Determination 
You can minimize sampling error by increasing the fraction of the population that is sampled 


N
n
. Increasing the sample size increases cost, of course. Several issues are critical in 
optimizing sample sizes. The following steps should be followed in setting the sample size. 
1. Select a homogeneous population. In order for sampling to be cost effective, the 
measured units should be expected to be the same as the entire population. If there are two 


---

## Page 198

98        Appendix B Uncertainty 
 
different types of units in the population, they should be grouped and sampled separately. 
For example, when designing a sampling program to measure the operating periods of room 
lighting controlled by occupancy sensors, rooms occupied more or less continuously (e.g., 
multiple person offices) should be separately sampled from those which are only 
occasionally occupied (e.g., meeting rooms). 
2. Determine the desired precision and confidence levels for the estimate (e.g., hours of 
use) to be reported. Precision refers to the error bound around the true estimate (i.e., ±x% 
range around the estimate). Higher precision requires larger sample. Confidence refers to 
the probability that the estimate will fall in the range of precision (i.e., the probability that the 
estimate will indeed fall in the ±x% range defined by the precision statement). Higher 
probability also requires larger samples. For example, if you want 90% confidence and 
±10% precision, you mean that the range defined for the estimate (±10%) will contain the 
true value for the whole group (which is not observed) with a probability of 90%. As an 
example, in estimating the lighting hours at a facility, it was decided to use sampling 
because it was too expensive to measure the operating hours of all lighting circuits. 
Metering a sample of circuits provided an estimate of the true operating hours. To meet a  
90/10 uncertainty criterion (confidence and precision) the sample size is determined such 
that, once the operating hours are estimated by sampling, the range of sample estimate 
(±10%) has to have a 90% chance of capturing the true hours of use .  
The conventional approach is to design sampling to achieve a 90% confidence level and 
±10% precision. However, the M&V Plan needs to consider the limits created by the budget 
(see Chapter 8.5). Improving precision from say ±20% to ±10% will increase sample size by 
4 times, while improving it to ±2% will increase sample size by 100 times. (This is a result of 
the sample error being inversely proportional to
n .) Selecting the appropriate sampling 
criteria requires balancing accuracy requirements with M&V costs.  
3. Decide on the level of disaggregation. Establish whether the confidence and precision 
level criteria should be applied to the measurement of all components, or to various sub-
groups of components. See Appendix B-5.2. Review the precision and confidence criteria 
chosen in 2.  
4. Calculate Initial Sample Size. Based on the information above, an initial estimate of the 
overall sample size can be determined using the following equation:

where: 
 
no  
is the initial estimate of the required sample size, before sampling begins  
 
cv  
is the coefficient of variance, defined as the standard deviation of the readings 
divided by the mean. Until the actual mean and standard deviation of the population can 
be estimated from actual samples, 0.5 may be used as an initial estimate for cv.  
 
e  
is the desired level of precision. 
 
z  
is the standard normal distribution value from Table B-1, with an infinite number 
of readings, and for the desired confidence level. For example z is 1.96 for a 95% 
confidence level (1.64 for 90%, 1.28 for 80%, and 0.67 for 50% confidence).   
For example, for 90% confidence with 10% precision, and a cv of 0.5, the initial 
estimate of required sample size (no) is

In some cases (e.g., metering of lighting hours or use), it may be desirable to initially 
conduct a small sample for the sole purpose of estimating a cv value to assist in planning 
the sampling program. Also values from previous M&V work may be used as appropriate 
initial estimates of cv.  
5. Adjust initial sample size estimate for small populations. The necessary sample size 
can be reduced if the entire population being sampled is no more than 20 times the size of 
the sample. For the initial sample size example, above, (no = 67), if the population (N) from 
which it is being sampled is only 200, the population is only 3 times the size of the sample. 
Therefore the “Finite Population Adjustment” can be applied. This adjustment reduces the 
sample size (n) as follows:

Applying this finite population adjustment to the above example reduces the sample size (n) 
required to meet the 90%/±10% criterion to 50. See an example use of this adjustment in 
Appendix A-3-1. 
6. Finalize Sample Size.  Because the initial sample size (no) is determined using an assumed 
cv, it is critical to remember that the actual cv of the population being sampled may be 
different. Therefore a different actual sample size may be needed to meet the precision 
criterion. If the actual cv turns out to be less than the initial assumption in step 4, the 
required sample size will be unnecessarily large to meet the precision goals. If the actual cv 
turns out to be larger than assumed, then the precision goal will not be met unless the 
sample size increases beyond the value computed by Equations B-16 and B-17.  
As sampling continues, the mean and standard deviation of the readings should be 
computed. The actual cv and required sample size (Equations B-16 and B-17) should be re-
computed. This re-computation may allow early curtailment of the sampling process. It may 
also lead to a requirement to conduct more sampling than originally planned. To maintain 
M&V costs within budget it may be appropriate to establish a maximum sample size. If this 
maximum is actually reached after the above re-computations, the savings report(s) should 
note the actual precision achieved by the sampling.  
B-4   Metering  
Energy quantities and independent variables are often measured as part of an M&V program, 
using meters. No meter is 100% accurate, though more sophisticated meters may increase the 
accuracy towards 100%. The accuracy of selected meters is published by the meter 
manufacturer, from laboratory tests. Proper meter sizing, for the range of possible quantities to 
be measured, ensures that collected data fall within known and acceptable error limits (or 
precision). 
Manufacturers typically rate precision as either a fraction of the current reading or as a fraction 
of the maximum reading on the meter’s scale. In this latter case it is important to consider where 
the typical readings fall on the meter’s scale before computing the precision of typical readings. 


---

## Page 200

100        Appendix B Uncertainty 
 
Over-sizing of meters whose precision is stated relative to maximum reading will significantly 
reduce the precision of the actual metering. 
The readings of many meter systems will ‘drift’ over time due to mechanical wear. Periodic re-
calibration against a known standard is required to adjust for this drift. It is important to maintain 
the precision of meters in the field through routine maintenance, and calibration against known 
standards.  
In addition to accuracy of the meter element itself, other possibly unknown effects can reduce 
meter system precision:   
 
poor placement of the meter so it does not get a representative ‘view’ of the quantity it is 
supposed to measure (e.g., a fluid flow meter’s readings are affected by proximity to an 
elbow in the pipe) 
 
data telemetry errors which randomly or systematically clip off meter data 
As a result of such unquantifiable metering errors, it is important to realize that manufacturer-
quoted precision probably overstates the precision of the actual readings in the field. However 
there is no way to quantify these other effects. 
Manufacturer precision statements should be in accordance with the relevant industry standard 
for their product. Care should be taken to determine the confidence level used in quoting a 
meter’s precision. Unless stated otherwise, the confidence is likely to be 95%.  
When a single measurement is used in a savings computation, rather than the mean of several 
measurements, the methods of Appendix B-5 are used to combine uncertainties of several 
components. The standard error of the measured value is: 
 
 
 
 
t
value
measured
precision
relative
meter
SE


 
B-18 
 
Where t is based on the large sampling done by the meter manufacturer when developing its 
relative precision statement. Therefore the Table B-1 value of t should be for infinite sample 
sizes. 
When making multiple readings with a meter, the observed values contain both meter error and 
variations in the phenomenon being measured. The mean of the readings likewise contains both 
effects. The standard error of the estimated mean value of the measurements is found using 
equation B-4.  
Chapters 4.8.3 and 8.11 further discuss metering and provide references to other useful 
readings on metering.  
B-5   Combining Components of Uncertainty 
Both the measurement and adjustment components in Equation 1 of Chapter 4 can introduce 
uncertainty in reporting savings. The uncertainties in the individual components can be 
combined to enable overall statements of savings’ uncertainty. This combination can be 
performed by expressing the uncertainty of each component in terms of its standard error.  
The components must be independent to use the following methods for combining uncertainties. 
Independence means that whatever random errors affect one of the components are unrelated 
to the errors affecting other components.  
If the reported savings is the sum or difference of several independently determined 
components (C) (i.e.,

If the M&V Plan requires measurement of hours of use, then “Hours” will be a value with a 
standard error.  If the M&V Plan also includes measurement of the change in wattage, then 
ΔWatts will also be a value with a standard error. Relative standard error of savings will be

Where N is the number of savings results with the same Standard Error that are added together. 
Once the standard error of the savings is determined from the above procedures, it is possible 
to make appropriate concluding statements about the relative amount of uncertainty inherent in 
the savings, using the mathematics of the standard normal distribution curve, Figure B-1, or 
data in Table B-1. For example, one can compute three values:  
1. the absolute or relative precision of the total saving, for a given level of confidence (e.g., 
90%), computed using the relevant t value from Table B-1 and Equation B-7 or B-9, 
respectively. 
2. Probable Error (PE), defined as the 50% confidence range. Probable Error represents the 
most likely amount of error. That is, it is equally likely that error will be larger or smaller than 
the PE. (ASHRAE, 1997). Table B-1 shows that 50% confidence level is achieved at t = 0.67 
for samples sizes larger than 120, or 0.67 standard errors from the mean value. So the 
range of probable error in reported savings using Equation B-8 is ±0.67 x SE (Savings). 
3. The 90% Confidence Limit (CL), defined as the range where we are 90% certain that 
random effects did not produce the observed difference. From Table B-1 using Equation B-
8, CL is ±1.64 x SE(Savings) for sample sizes larger than 120. 
B-5.1 Assessing Interactions of Multiple Components of Uncertainty 
Equations B-19 and B-20 for combining uncertainty components can be used to estimate how 
errors in one component will affect the accuracy of the overall savings report. M&V resources 
can then be designed to cost-effectively reduce error in reported savings. Such design 
considerations would take into account the costs and the effects on savings precision of 
possible improvements in the precision of each component.  
Software applications written for common spreadsheet tools allow for easy assessment of the 
net error associated with the combination of multiple components of uncertainty, using Monte 
Carlo techniques. Monte Carlo analysis allows the assessment of multiple “what if” scenarios 
revealing a range of possible outcomes, their probability of occurring, and which component has 
the most effect on the final output. Such analysis identifies where resources need to be 
allocated to control error. 
A simple illustration of “what if” analysis is presented below for a lighting retrofit. A nominally 96 
watt light fixture is replaced with a nominal 64-watt fixture. If the fixture operates for 10 hours 
every day, the annual savings would be computed as:

The new 64-watt fixture’s wattage is consistent and easily measured with accuracy. However 
there is much variation among the old-fixture wattages and among the hours of use in different 
locations. Old-fixture wattages and hours of use are not easily measured with certainty. 
Therefore the savings will also not be known with certainty. The M&V design challenge is to 
determine the impact on reported savings if the measurement of either of these uncertain 
quantities is in error by plausible amounts. 
Figure B2 shows a sensitivity analysis of the savings for the two parameters, old-fixture watts, 
and hours of use. Each is varied by up to 30% and the impact on savings is shown. It can be 
seen that savings are significantly more sensitive to variation in old-fixture wattage than to hours 
of use. A 30% wattage error produces a 90% savings error, while a 30% error in operating 
hours produces only a 30% savings error.

If the proposed M&V method will yield readings of old-fixture wattage with a range of uncertainty 
of ±5%, the range of electricity savings uncertainty will be ±15%. In other words, if the old-fixture 
wattage could be between 91 and 101 watts, the savings could be between 99 and 135 kWh 
annually. The range of uncertainty on the savings is 36 kWh (135 - 99). If the marginal value of 
electricity is 10 cents per kWh, the uncertainty range is about $3.60 annually. If the wattage of 
the old fixture could be estimated with greater precision for significantly less than $3.60, then it 
may be worth enhanced-measurement efforts, depending on the number of years of savings 
being considered.  
Figure B2 shows that the hours-of-use term has less of an impact on final savings in this 
example (the hours-of-use line is flatter indicating lower sensitivity). It is plausible that the error 
in measurement of operating hours is ±20%, so the energy-savings uncertainty range is also 
±20% or ±23 kWh (= 20% of 117 kWh). The range in savings is about 46 kWh (= 2 x 23 kWh), 
worth $4.60 per year. Again it may be warranted to increase the accuracy in measuring the 
hours of use if it can be done for significantly less than $4.60, depending upon the number of 
years of savings being considered. 
The range of possible savings errors from errors in measuring operating hours (46 kWh) is 
greater than from the error in measuring the old-fixture wattages (36 kWh). This is the opposite 
effect from what might be expected based on the greater sensitivity of savings to wattage than 
to hours of use, as seen in Figure B2. This difference arises because the plausible error of 
measuring operating hours (±20%) is much larger than the plausible error of measuring old-
fixture wattages (±5%).  
Sensitivity analysis such as the above can take many forms. The preceding simple example 
was used to show the principles. Monte Carlo simulation, allows complex consideration of many 
different parameters, allowing M&V design to focus expenditures where most needed to 
improve the overall accuracy of savings reports. 
B-5.2   Establishing Targets for Quantifiable Savings Uncertainty 
As discussed in Appendix B-1, not all uncertainties can be quantified. However, those that can 
be quantified provide guidance in M&V Planning. By considering the M&V cost of various 
optional approaches to uncertainty, the M&V program can produce the type of information that 
is acceptable to all readers of the savings report, including those who have to pay for the M&V 
reports. Ultimately, any M&V Plan should report the expected level of quantifiable uncertainty 
(see Chapter 5).

104        Appendix B Uncertainty 
 
Determination of energy savings requires estimating a difference in energy levels, rather than 
simply measuring the level of energy itself. In general, calculating a difference to suit a Retail Chain A 
relative precision criterion requires better absolute precision in the component measurements 
than the absolute precision required of the difference. For example, suppose the average load is 
around 500 kW, and the anticipated savings are around 100 kW. A ±10% error with 90% 
confidence (“90/10”) criterion can be applied two ways: 
 
If applied to the load measurements, absolute precision must be 50 kW (10% of 500 kW) at 
90% confidence.  
 
If applied to the reported savings, absolute precision in the savings must be 10 kW (10% of 
100 kW) at the same 90% confidence level. To achieve this 10 kW absolute precision in 
reported savings requires component measurement absolute precisions of 7 kW (using 
Equation B-19, if both components are to have the same precision).  
Clearly the application of the 90/10 confidence/precision criterion at the level of the savings 
requires much more precision in the load measurement than a 90/10 requirement at the level of 
the load. 
The precision criterion may be applied not only to energy savings, but also to parameters that 
determine savings. For example, suppose the savings amount is the product of the number (N) 
of units, hours (H) of operation, and change (C) in watts:  Savings = N x H x C. The 90/10 
criterion could be applied separately to each of these parameters. However, achieving 90/10 
precision for each of these parameters separately does not imply that 90/10 is achieved for the 
savings, which is the parameter of ultimate interest. In fact using Equation B-20, the precision at 
90% confidence would only be ±17%. On the other hand, if the number of units and change in 
watts are assumed to be known without error, 90/10 precision for hours implies 90/10 precision 
for savings. 
The precision standard could be imposed at various levels. The choice of level of 
disaggregation dramatically affects the M&V design and associated costs. In general, data 
collection requirements increase if precision requirements are imposed on each component. If 
the primary goal is to control savings precision for a project as a whole, it is not necessary to 
impose the same precision requirement on each component.   
B-6   Example Uncertainty Analysis 
To illustrate the use of the various statistical tools for uncertainty analysis, Table B-3 shows an 
example spreadsheet regression model output. It is a regression of a building’s 12 monthly 
electric-utility consumption-meter values and cooling degree days (CDD) over a one-year 
period. This is just a partial spreadsheet output. Specific values of interest are highlighted in 
italics.

For A Baseline of 12 Monthly kWh and CDD Data Points the derived regression model is: 
 
 
 
Monthly electricity consumption = 5,634.15 + (7.94 x CDD) 
 
The coefficient of determination, R2, (shown as “R Square” in Table B-3) is quite high at 0.93, 
indicating that 93% of the variation in the 12 energy data points is explained by the model using 
CDD data. This fact implies a very strong relationship and that the model may be used to 
estimate adjustment terms in the relevant form of Equation 1 in Chapter 4. 
The estimated coefficient of 7.94 kWh per CDD has a standard error of 0.68. This SE leads to a 
t-statistic (shown as “T stat” in Table B-3) of 11.64. This t-statistic is then compared to the 
appropriate critical t value in Table B-1 (t = 2.2 for 12 data points and 95% confidence). 
Because 11.64 exceeds 2.2, CDD is a highly significant independent variable. The spreadsheet 
also shows that the range for the coefficient at the 95% level of confidence is 6.42 to 9.45, and 
implies a relative precision of ±19% ( = (7.94 - 6.42) / 7.94). In other words, we are 95% 
confident that each additional CDD increases kWh consumption between 6.42 and 9.45 kWh.   
The standard error of the estimate using the regression formula is 367.5. The average CDDs 
per month is 162 (not shown in output). To predict what electric consumption would have been 
under average cooling conditions, for example, this CDD value is inserted into the regression 
model:  
 
 
Predicted consumption  
= 5,634 + (7.94 x 162)  
 
 
 
 
 
= 6,920 kWh per average cooling degree day month 
 
Using a Table B-1 t-value of 2.2, for 12 data points and a 95% confidence level, the range of 
possible predictions is: 
 
 
Range of predictions = 6,920 ± (2.2 x 367.5) = 6,112 to 7,729 kWh. 
 
The absolute precision is approximately ±809 kWh ( =  2.2 x 367.5 ) and the relative precision is 
±12% ( =  809 / 6,920 ). The spreadsheet described value for the standard error of the estimate 
provided the information needed to compute the relative precision expected from use of the 
regression model for any one month, in this case 12%.

If reporting-period consumption was 4,300 kWh, savings computed using Chapter 4, Equation 
1b) will be: 
 
 
Savings = 6,920 – 4,300 = 2,600 kWh 
 
Since the utility meter was used to obtain the reporting-period electricity value, its reported 
values may be treated as 100% accurate (SE = 0%) because the utility meter defines the 
amounts paid, regardless of meter error. The SE of the savings number will be:

Using t of 2.2, the range of possible monthly savings is

= 2,620 ± (2.2 x 367.5)  
 
 
 
 
=  2,620 ± -810  = 1,810 to 3,430 
 
To determine the precision of the annual total of monthly savings, it is assumed that the 
standard error of each month’s savings will be the same. The annual reported savings then 
have a standard error of: 
 
 
 
SE (annual savings) =

 = 1,273 kWh 
 
Since t derives from the model of the baseline, it remains at the 2.2 value used above.  
Therefore the absolute precision in annual savings is 2.2 x 1,273 = 2,801 kWh. 
Assuming equal monthly savings of 2,620 kWh, annual savings are 31,440 kWh, and the 
relative precision of the annual savings report is 9% ( = (2,801 / 31,440) x 100).

Addition to Chapter 1.3 “IPMVP’s Relationship To Other M&V Guidelines” 
 
ASHRAE, Guideline 14-2002 Measurement of Energy and Demand Savings (see Reference 
3 in Chapter 10). This American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning 
Engineers, Inc. document  provides complementary detail for IPMVP. Guideline 14 had 
many of the same original authors as IPMVP. Though Guideline 14 provides technical detail 
following many of the same concepts of IPMVP, it does not use the same Option names as 
IPMVP. Guideline 14 is a unique and useful resource for M&V professionals around the 
world and is available for purchase through ASHRAE’s bookstore at 
http://resourcecenter.ashrae.org/store/ashrae/. 
 
M&V Guidelines: Measurement and Verification for Federal Energy Projects, Version 2.2 - 
2000 (see Reference 27 in Chapter 10). The U.S. Department of Energy's Federal Energy 
Management Program (FEMP) was established, in part, to reduce energy costs of operating 
U.S. government federal facilities. The FEMP M&V Guideline was first published in 1996 
with many of the same authors as IPMVP. It provides detailed guidance on specific M&V 
methods for a variety of ECMs. The FEMP Guide is generally consistent with the IPMVP 
framework, except that it does not require site measurment of energy use for two specific 
ECMs. The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory website (http://ateam.lbl.gov/mv/) 
contains the FEMP M&V Guideline, and a number of other M&V resource documents, 
including one on the estimations used in Option A, and an M&V checklist.

Addition to Chapter 4.7, last paragraph. 
ASHRAE (2002) provides more technical details on a similar retrofit isolation method 
Addition to Chapter 4.7 
Specific applications of retrofit-isolation techniques to common ECMs chosen by the United 
States Department of Energy are shown in Section III of FEMP (2000). Note however that 
FEMP’s applications LE-A-01, LC-A-01 and CH-A-01 are not consistent with IPMVP because 
they require no measurement. 
ASHRAE (2002) provides more detailed specifications for a similar method.  
Addition to Chapter 4.8.1 
Chapter 2.2.1 of FEMP (2000) summarizes common duties borne by parties to an energy-
performance contract. The United States Federal Energy Management Program has also 
published Detailed Guidelines for FEMP M&V Option A (2002) giving further guidance on 
estimation issues faced by U.S. federal agencies. (Note: the FEMP guidelines call estimated 
values “stipulations.”) 
 
Addition to Chapter 4.9 
 
Resources that provide detailed methods for defining new construction baselines, include: 
ASHRAE Standard 90.1 Appendix G – Performance Rating Method, the COMNET Commercial 
Building Energy Modeling Guidelines and Procedures and the Title-24 Alternative Calculation 
Manual. In addition, it is becoming more commonplace that commercially-available simulatioin 
programs are capable of automatically generating a minimally-compliant baseline building 
based on an as-designed building model per various rating methods.  
ASHRAE (2002) provides more technical details on a similar method and on calibrating 
simulation models to utility bills.  
 
Addition to Chapter 4.9.1 
Information on building simulation programs in common use in different parts of the world can 
be found in Chapter 6.3 of ASHRAE (2002).  
 
Addition to Chapter 4.9.2, Item 5. 
ASHRAE (2002), Chapter 6.3, gives more information on calibration accuracy. 
Addition to Chapter 4.9.1 
Information on different types of building simulation models can be found in Chapter 32 of the 
ASHRAE Handbook (2005). The United States Department of Energy (DOE) also maintains a 
current list of public-domain software and proprietary building-energy-simulation programs at 
www.eren.doe.gov/buildings/tools_directory. 
ASHRAE’s simplified energy-analysis procedure may also be used if the building’s heat losses, 
heat gains, internal loads, and HVAC systems are simple.  
Other types of special-purpose programs are used to simulate energy use of HVAC 
components. See  ASHRAE’s HVAC02 toolkit (Brandemuehl 1993), and for boiler/chiller 
equipment HVAC01 toolkit (Bourdouxhe 1994a, 1994b, 1995). Simplified component air-side 
HVAC models are also available in a report by Knebel (1983). Equations for numerous other 
models have been identified as well (ASHRAE 1989, SEL 1996).

C-3  España - 2009 
En el desarrollo del IPMVP en España, aunque no existe una normativa específica para la 
Medida y verificación de proyectos eficientes existen particularidades y utilidades propias de su 
legislación y normativa que conviene conocer. 
Por ello, se anexa información específica de España: 
Anexos al Capítulo 4.9.1 
Para la obtención de la escala de calificación energética de edificios, en España, se ha 
realizado un estudio específico en el que se detalla el procedimiento utilizado para obtener los 
límites de dicha escala en función del tipo de edificio considerado y de la climatología de la 
localidad. Este procedimiento ha tomado en consideración las escalas que en la actualidad se 
sopesan en otros países y, en particular, la propuesta que figura en el documento del CEN 
prEN 15217 “Energy performance of buildings: Methods for expresing energy preformance and 
for energy certification of buildings”.  
La determinación del nivel de eficiencia energética correspondiente a un edificio puede 
realizarse empleando dos opciones:  
 
La opción general, de carácter prestacional, a través de un programa informático; y la 
opción simplificada, de carácter prescriptivo, que desarrolla la metodología de cálculo 
de la calificación de eficiencia energética de una manera indirecta.  
 
La opción general se basa en la utilización de programas informáticos que cumplen los 
requisitos exigidos en la metodología de cálculo dada en el RD 47/2007. Se ha 
desarrollado un programa informático de referencia denominado Calener, promovido por 
el Ministerio de Industria, Turismo y Comercio a través del IDAE y la Dirección General 
de Arquitectura y Política de Vivienda del Ministerio de Vivienda.  
Este programa cuenta con dos versiones:  
 
Calener_VYP, para edificios de Viviendas y del Pequeño y Mediano Terciario (Equipos 
autónomos).  
 
Calener_GT, para grandes edificios del sector terciario.  
La utilización de programas informáticos distintos a los de referencia está sujeta a la 
aprobación de los mismos por parte de la Comisión Asesora para la Certificación Energética de 
Edificios. Esta aprobación se hará de acuerdo con los criterios que se establece en el 
Documento de Condiciones de Aceptación de Procedimientos Alternativos a Líder y Calener.  
El Programa informatico Calener es una herramienta promovida por el Ministerio de Industria, 
Turismo y Comercio, a través del IDAE , y por el Ministerio de Vivienda, que permite determinar 
el nivel de eficiencia energética correspondiente a un edificio. El programa consta de dos 
herramientas informaticas para una utilización mas fácil por el usuarioNT.

This Appendix uses terms explained in Volume I Chapters as noted in brackets, or as defined in 
Chapter 9 for italicized words. 
D-1    Energy-Performance Contractors and Their Building Customers 
The primary purpose of M&V in the context of building energy-performance contracts is 
presenting the actual monetary performance of a retrofit project. The M&V Plan becomes part of 
the energy-performance contract’s terms, and defines the measurements and computations to 
determine payments or demonstrate compliance with a guaranteed level of performance. 
M&V costs may be controlled by considering the responsibilities of all parties to the contract. 
Where some parameters can be estimated with accuracy sufficient for all parties, Option A 
(Chapter 4.8.1) may be most economical. For example, a contractor undertaking to improve the 
efficiency of a chiller plant may simply be required to demonstrate the before and after retrofit 
chiller efficiency, without consideration of the ongoing energy use, which is driven by cooling 
loads that are not the contractor’s responsibility. However if the contractor agrees to reduce 
chiller plant energy use, comparison of before and after chiller plant energy use would be 
required. In this latter case Option B (Chapter 4.8.2) would be used if chiller plant energy meters 
are used, or Option C (Chapter 4.9) if whole facility (utility) meters are used to measure total 
building energy performance. 
Where the energy-performance contract focuses on total facility performance, or where it is 
difficult to evaluate the effects or several ECMs, Option C would be used. Care should be taken 
to ensure that the M&V Plan (Chapter 5) lists baseline static factors and assigns responsibility 
for their monitoring throughout the reporting period. However for new construction, Option D 
would be used (Chapter 4.10 or IPMVP Volume III Part I). Where central metering exists on a 
multiple building campus and no individual building meters are yet in place, Option D (Chapter 
4.10) can be used, so that the retrofit does not have to be held up to obtain new sub-meter 
baseline data for a year before planning the retrofit. 
Measurements may be made throughout the term of the energy-performance contract or for a 
contract defined test period shortly after retrofit. The longer the reporting period (Chapter 4.5.2),

or the broader the boundary of measurement (Chapter 4.4), the more attention must be paid to 
the possibility of baseline change after retrofit. This possibility requires good advance recording 
of static factors in the M&V Plan and diligent monitoring of conditions after retrofit (Chapter 8.2). 
The complexity of the M&V system’s meter design (Chapters 4.8.3 and 8.11) and computations 
should also consider M&V costs, the expected magnitude of the savings, project economics and 
desired accuracy of reporting (Chapters 8.3 - 8.5, and Appendix B). 
The prices used for monetizing the energy/water/demand units saved should be those 
established in the contract (Chapter 8.1). 
Where an energy user feels it does not have the capability to review an M&V Plan or savings 
report, it may hire a verifier, separate from the energy-performance contractor (Chapter 8.6). 
Appendix A contains examples IPMVP applications to buildings (Sections A-7, A-8, A-9, while 
A-2, A-3 and A-6 relate to technologies found in most buildings). 
D-2   Energy-Performance Contractors and Their Industrial Customers  
The primary purpose of M&V for industrial energy-performance contacts is usually to 
demonstrate the short-term performance of a retrofit project. Following such demonstration the 
plant management takes over responsibility for operation, and usually does not seek an ongoing 
relationship with an ESCO. The M&V Plan becomes part of the energy performance contract 
terms, and defines the measurements and computations to determine payments or demonstrate 
compliance with any guaranteed level of performance. 
Industrial processes often involve complex relationships between energy use and a wider range 
of energy-governing variables than do buildings. In addition to weather, parameters such as 
product type, raw material variations, production rate and shift scheduling may be considered. 
Use caution selecting the independent variables to be used (Appendix B-2.1). The analysis 
becomes very difficult if attempting to identify savings at the main plant energy meters, 
especially if there is more than one product type being produced in the plant.  
ECM-Isolation Options (Chapter 4.8) help to minimize the complications from production 
variables that are usually unrelated to terms of the performance contract. Retrofit Isolation 
narrows the measurement boundary to just those systems whose energy performance can be 
easily compared to production variables. The installation of isolation meters for M&V may also 
provide helpful feedback for process control.   
M&V costs may be controlled by considering the responsibilities of all parties to the energy-
performance contract. Where some parameters can be estimated with accuracy sufficient for all 
parties, Option A (Chapter 4.8.1) may be most economical. For example, a contractor who 
agrees to increase furnace efficiency may demonstrate the change in furnace energy use at 
peak load after installation of a flue gas heat recovery device. He is not responsible for ongoing 
energy use of the furnace, which is governed by production parameters beyond his control. 
However, if the contractor agrees instead to reduce furnace energy use, retrofitted furnace 
energy use is compared to the predicted energy requirements of the original furnace over a time 
period. In this latter case Option B (Chapter 4.8.2) governs the agreement if a meter measures 
the furnace’s fuel consumption. Option C (Chapter 4.9) governs the agreement if main plant 
utility meters or departmental sub-meters measure total energy performance of the plant or a 
department within the plant. 
Take care when using ECM-Isolation techniques to consider all energy flows affected by the 
ECM (Chapter 4.4), including interactive effects.  
Energy-performance contracts in industrial plants often require measurements for a short 
reporting period after retrofit. Longer reporting periods (Chapter 4.5.2), or broader boundaries of 
measurement (Chapter 4.4), require more attention to possible baseline change after retrofit.

Good advance recording of static factors in the M&V Plan (Chapter 5) and diligent monitoring of 
conditions after retrofit (Chapter 8.2) will help identify baseline change.  
Plant managers would normally employ long-term energy monitoring to continuously minimize 
energy waste. Energy-performance contractors may focus instead on short-term monitoring to 
demonstrate their performance (Chapter 4.5.2).  
For retrofits that may be easily turned off temporarily, such as a heat recovery device, 
sequential short-term tests, which use the On/Off Test technique (Chapter 4.5.3), can 
demonstrate performance. 
The complexity of the M&V system’s meter design (Chapters 4.8.3 and 8.12) and computations 
should also consider M&V costs, the expected magnitude of the savings, project economics and 
desired accuracy of reporting (Chapters 8.3 - 8.5 and Appendix B). 
The prices used for valuing the savings should be those established in the energy performance 
contract (Chapter 8.1). 
The energy user may hire a verifier, separate from the energy-performance contractor (Chapter 
8.6) when he or she lacks the ability to review an M&V Plan or savings report. 
Appendix A contains examples of industrial applications of IPMVP (Sections A-4, A-5, while A-2, 
A-3.1 and A-6 relate to technologies found in most industrial plants). 
D-3   Industrial and Building Energy Users Doing Their Own Retrofits 
Energy users often install ECMs themselves. When they are confident about achieving the 
planned savings, a ‘no M&V’ approach leaves the entire budget available for retrofits. However 
energy users may need to justify investments, add credibility to requests for future investments, 
or quantify uncertain performance. 
M&V design issues would be similar to those described in Chapters 1.4.1. or 1.4.2, above, 
except that there is no division of responsibility between energy user and an energy 
performance contractor. Reporting costs may be lower because of less formal reporting. 
D-4   Facility Managers Accounting For Energy/Water Budget Variances 
To manage energy costs successfully, a facility manager should understand the relationship 
between energy use and facility operating parameters. Important operating parameters include 
occupancy, production rate, and weather. If a facility manager neglects these independent 
variables, he or she may struggle to explain variances from predicted energy budgets. He/she 
also risks future budgeting errors. Baseline adjustments are also necessary to account for non-
routine changes at the facility. 
Even if no savings are planned, the calculation techniques of Chapter 4 can help to explain 
energy-budget variances. Therefore, M&V Plans (Chapter 5) are useful with or without retrofits. 
Whole facility, Option C methods (Chapter 4.9), may be used, based on main (utility) meters or 
sub-meters for major sections of the facility. If sub-meters are in place on specific pieces of 
equipment (Chapter 4.8) they may help allocate costs to user departments or tenants within the 
facility (using Option A or B approaches). 
Components critical to the variations in the overall energy budget may be isolated for separate 
metering of either their energy use (Option B, Chapter 4.8.2) or of a key parameter of energy 
use (Option A, Chapter 4.8.1). Both of these cases call for long-term metering. Pay close 
attention to the cost of maintaining and calibrating meters and managing data received from the 
meters (see Chapter 4.8.3 and 8.12).

D-5   New Building Designers  
New building investors often wish to compare their performance to what it would have been if 
they had not included some specific energy efficiency features in the design. The absence of 
real baseline data normally requires the use of Option D (Chapter 4.10) to develop a baseline. 
The computer simulation skills needed to properly apply Option D might normally be on the 
design team at the time of design. However the critical element of Option D is the calibration of 
the simulation against data gathered after a one-year period. Therefore it is important to ensure 
that the simulation skills remain available until calibration is achieved. 
Following the first year of steady operation it would be normal to use the actual energy data of 
the first steady year as a new baseline, switching to using Option C (Chapter 4.9) to determine 
changes from the first year’s new baseline. 
All the challenges for new buildings are addressed in more depth in IPMVP Volume III Part I, 
New Construction, including different methods for special situations. 
D-6   New Building Designers Seeking Recognition for Their Sustainable 
Designs 
Building designers may seek to have their designs recognized under a sustainable design 
program. To qualify, the building may need to have an M&V system that adheres to IPMVP. 
IPMVP adherence is defined in Chapter 7 as preparation of an M&V Plan (Chapter 5) using 
IPMVP terminology, and then following the M&V Plan.   
The designer would also follow the guidance above in Chapter 1.4.5 and IPMVP Volume III Part 
I. 
D-7   Existing Building Managers Seeking Recognition for the 
Environmental Quality of their Building Operations 
Managers of existing buildings may seek recognition for the environmental quality of their 
operating methods. To qualify they may need to have an M&V system that adheres to IPMVP. 
IPMVP adherence is defined in Chapter 7 as preparation of an M&V Plan (Chapter 5) using 
IPMVP terminology and then following the M&V Plan. IPMVP’s Retrofit Isolation type M&V 
(Chapter 4.8) may also assist in obtaining recogntion for the number of installed sub-meters. 
Option C (Chapter 4.9) would provide the total facility performance monitoring that is 
appropriate to existing buildings. However if no whole building meters existed before seeking 
recogntion, Option D (Chapter 4.10) is needed during the period of developing a baseline for a 
year after main meters are initially installed on the building. 
Building managers would also follow the guidance above in Chapter 1.4.3. 
D-8   Regional Efficiency-Program Designers and Managers   
Designers and managers of regional or utility-company demand-side-management (DSM) 
programs usually need to develop rigorous ways to evaluate the effectiveness of their energy-
efficiency programs. One way to evaluate a DSM program’s impact is to assess the savings 
made in randomly chosen end-user facilities. This data can be used to project the results across 
the entire group of DSM program participants. Use IPMVP Options presented in Chapter 4 to 
assess the savings in the sample facilities.  
The evaluation design for any regional program should specify which of the IPMVP Options are 
allowable. It should also specify the minimum required sampling, measurement, and analytical 
accuracies, in order to provide sufficient rigor in program reporting.

## Page 221

 
Appendix D Users of IPMVP         121 
 
Utilities already have the whole facility data for their commodity in their databases, so may apply 
Option C (Chapter 4.9) on all program participants or a sample of them. However without 
adequate knowledge of changes within each facility, a large percentage of variation in the 
savings should be expected, especially as time elapses between the baseline and reporting 
periods.  
EVO is monitoring the needs of the utility program evaluation community. EVO is considering 
development of special M&V guidance for DSM program evaluation, and for establishing 
baselines for measuring the ‘demand response’ of customers receiving utility price or 
curtailment signals (see Preface – EVO’s Future Plans).  
D-9   Water-Efficiency Project Developers  
Water-efficiency M&V is analogous to energy-efficiency M&V, so uses similar M&V techniques. 
The relevant technique for any project depends upon the nature of the change being evaluated, 
and upon the user’s situation as discussed in Chapters 1.4.1 through 1.4.5 and 1.4.8.  
Water-consuming equipment is often in the control of facility users (building occupants or 
production managers). Therefore it can be difficult to monitor user behavior as needed to make 
adjustments to total-facility water use for the application of Option C methods. Retrofit Isolation 
methods are often more easily applied (Chapter 4.8), using a sample of the retrofits (Appendix 
B-3) to demonstrate the performance of an entire group of changes. 
Where outdoor water use is being evaluated, the adjustments term in IPMVP Equation 1 
(Chapter 4) may be related to parameters that drive water use such as rainfall. 
Liquid flow measurements devices (see Chapter 8.11, Table 5) are most commonly applied in 
M&V for water efficiency projects.  
D-10   Emission Trading Programs 
Energy-efficiency programs can be central to helping large energy users meet their regulated 
emission allocation. All of the techniques of this document help energy users manage their 
energy use, through proper accounting (Chapters 1.4.3 and 1.4.4).  
Energy-efficiency projects may also be the basis of trades in emission-reduction commodities 
(credits, offsets, set asides, etc). Since such trades must hold up under public scrutiny, 
compliance with an industry recognized protocol adds credibility to emission reduction claims.  
Trading-program designers should specify compliance with IPMVP, 2002 edition or later. They 
may go further and require fully measured energy-savings approaches (i.e. Options B or C, 
Chapters 4.8.2 or 4.9). This further specification reduces the uncertainty in the quantification by 
eliminating Options using estimated or simulated values rather than measured values. 
Chapter 8.7 discusses the special M&V design issues for emission trades. 
D-11  Energy Users Seeking ISO 50001 Certification 
The management methods required under ISO 50001 focus on managing total facility utility 
costs. IPMVP’s Options C and D (Chapters 4.9 and 4.10) describe methods useful for this 
purpose, even if no savings are being sought. However IPMVP cautions on the challenges of 
detecting small changes in whole facility utility energy use data. IPMVP offers both general 
guidance (Chapter 4.9) and specific guidance (Appendix B-1.2) on how large total facility energy 
use changes must be to be reportable with any statistical validity. If expected savings are not 
large enough, it would be appropriate to also use sub-meters for different sections of the facility. 
Also IPMVP’s Retrofit Isolation Options A and/or B (Chapter 4.8) would also be appropriate 
management tools for specific energy efficiency projects. However Chapter 4.8 cautions that 
Retrofit Isolation results cannot be correlated with whole facility utility bills.
