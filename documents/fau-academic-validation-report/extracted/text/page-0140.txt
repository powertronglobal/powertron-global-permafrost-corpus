40        Adherence with IPMVP 
 
CHAPTER 7   ADHERENCE WITH IPMVP  
IPMVP is a framework of definitions and methods for properly assessing savings in energy or 
water use or demand. The IPMVP guides users in developing M&V Plans for specific projects. 
IPMVP is written to allow maximum flexibility in creating M&V Plans, while adhering to the 
principles of accuracy, completeness, conservativeness, consistency, relevance and 
transparency (Chapter 3).  
Users claiming adherence with IPMVP must: 
1. Identify the person responsible for approving the site-specific M&V Plan, and for making 
sure that the M&V Plan is followed for the duration of the reporting period.  
2. Develop a complete M&V Plan which: 
 
clearly states the date of publication or the version number of the IPMVP edition and 
Volume being followed, 
 
uses terminology consistent with the definitions in the version of IPMVP cited,  
 
includes all information mentioned in the M&V Plan chapter (Chapter 5 of the present 
edition),  
 
is approved by all parties interested in adherence with IPMVP, and 
 
is consistent with the Principles of M&V shown in Chapter 3. 
 
3.   Follow the approved IPMVP adherent M&V Plan. 
4.   Prepare M&V reports containing the information mentioned in the M&V Reporting chapter 
(Chapter 6). 
Users wishing to specify the use of IPMVP in an energy performance contract or emission trade 
may use phrases such as, “The determination of actual energy and monetary savings will follow 
current best practice, as defined in IPMVP Volume I, EVO 10000 -1:2012.”  
Specification may go further to include “The M&V Plan shall adhere to IPMVP Volume I, EVO 
10000 - 1:2012 and be approved by……” and may also, if known at the time of contract 
approval, add, “following IPMVP Option ….”
