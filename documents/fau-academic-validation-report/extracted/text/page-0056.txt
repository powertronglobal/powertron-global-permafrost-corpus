ARI Modified 210/240: Testing Unitary air conditioning and air source heat pump equipment. 
 
This standard is intended for the guidance of the industry, including manufacturers, engineers, installers, contractors, 
and users. All procedures are defined by ARI and run under ARI supervision. The tests are independently monitored by 
ARI field engineers. Because ARI Standard 210 required constant load and humidity control, ARI modified the test to 
measure heat transfer at the test site and actual location for 
the HVAC systems. 
 
 
ARI Modified 550: Testing Water chilling packages using the vapor compression cycle. 
 
This standard is intended for the guidance of the industry, including manufacturers, engineers, installers, contractors, 
and users. The standard applies to all vapor compression refrigeration water chilling 
packages including one or more hermetic or open drive compressors (centrifugal, rotary, screw, scroll, reciprocating, or 
other types), equipped with either water-cooled, air-cooled, evaporative cooled 
condensers, or supplied without a condenser.
