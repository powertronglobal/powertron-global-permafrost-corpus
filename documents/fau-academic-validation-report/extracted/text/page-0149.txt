8.11  Measurement Issues 
The proper application of meters for specific applications is a science in itself. Numerous 
references are available for this purpose (see Chapter 10.2). The EVO web site contains 
relevant current references on measurement techniques.  
Table 5, below, summarizes some key types of meters, and provides comment on M&V matters 
for some of them. This Table should neither be taken as complete nor definitive. 
8.11.1 Data Collection Errors and Lost Data 
No data collection process is without error. Methodologies for reporting period data collection 
differ in degree of difficulty, and consequently in the amount of erroneous or missing data that 
may arise. The M&V Plan should establish a maximum acceptable rate of data loss and how it 
will be measured. This level should be part of the overall accuracy consideration. The level of 
data loss may dramatically affect cost. The M&V Plan should also establish a methodology by 
which missing or erroneous reporting-period data will be re-created by interpolation for final 
analysis. In such cases, reporting-period models are needed to interpolate between measured 
data points so that savings can be calculated for each period.   
Note that baseline data consist of real facts about energy and independent variables as they 
existed during the baseline period. Therefore baseline data problems should not be replaced by 
modelled data, except when using Option D. Where baseline data is missing or inadequate, 
seek other real data to substitute, or change the baseline period so that it contains only real 
data. The M&V Plan should document the source of all baseline data.
