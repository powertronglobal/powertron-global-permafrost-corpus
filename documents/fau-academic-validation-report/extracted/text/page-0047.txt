The data from in-situ and control units verified improvement in the efficiency of the 
systems.  Location is also an issue, but the comparison data for stressed summer 
weather does not show significant variation between sites.  Winter/summer conditions 
may be different, but for Florida, the winter conditions in other states do not often 
apply.  However the in-situ units came from different countries (South Africa, Brazil) 
and states, including a number in Florida, including south Florida, under typical 
summer conditions.  Humidity and elevation may make a difference, but there is not 
enough elevation or humidity difference in Florida to create an issue.   
 
The results appear to be accurate based on the information provided, and data not 
provided or missing was not considered.  The results appear to demonstrate 
improvement in HVAC performance based on the data provided.
