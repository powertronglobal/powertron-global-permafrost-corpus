8.1). Savings, as used in IPMVP, are not the simple difference between baseline and reporting 
period utility bills or metered quantities. See Chapter 4.1 for elaboration on this point.  
Significant Digits: Non-zero digits, and zeroes having non-zero digits to their left. Note that 
whole numbers (numbers displaying no decimal point) have an unlimited number of significant 
digits. Whole numbers ending in zero have an unclear number of significant digits. (See also 
Chapter 8.12.) Note also that when adding numbers, the significant digits rule is replaced by a 
rule on the number of digits after the decimal place. The number of such digits in any sum 
should match that of the number with the fewest such digits. 
Simulation Model: An assembly of algorithms that calculates energy use for a facility based on 
engineering equations and user-defined parameters. 
Standard Deviation:  See Appendix B-1.3. 
Standard Error:  See Appendix B-1.3. 
Standard Error of the Coefficient:  See Appendix B-2.2.3. 
Standard Error of the Estimate:  See Appendix B-2.2.2. 
Static Factors:  Those characteristics of a facility which affect energy use, within the chosen 
measurement boundary, but which are not used as the basis for any routine adjustments. These 
characteristics include fixed, environmental, operational and maintenance characteristics. They 
may be constant or varying. (See particularly Chapters 4.6 and 8.2.) 
t-statistic:  See Appendix B-2.2.3. 
Variance:  See Appendix B-1.3. 
Verification: The process of examining a report prepared by others to comment on its suitability 
for the intended purpose.
