B-1.1   Expressing Uncertainty 
In order to communicate savings in a statistically valid manner, savings need to be expressed 
along with their associated confidence and precision levels. Confidence refers to the likelihood 
or probability that the estimated savings will fall within the precision range.31 For example, the 
savings estimation process may lead to a statement such as: “the best estimate of savings is 
1,000 kWh annually (point estimate) with a 90% probability (confidence) that the true-average 
savings value falls within ±20% of 1,000.” A graphical presentation of this relationship is shown 
in Figure B-1.

A statistical precision statement (the ±20% portion) without a confidence level (the 90% portion) 
is meaningless. The M&V process may yield extremely high precision with low confidence. For 
example, the savings may be stated with a precision of ±1%, but the associated confidence 
level may drop from 95% to 35%.   
B-1.2   Acceptable Uncertainty 
Savings are deemed to be statistically valid if they are large relative to the statistical variations. 
Specifically, the savings need to be larger than twice the standard error (see definition in 
Appendix B-1.3) of the baseline value. If the variance of the baseline data is excessive, the 
unexplained random behavior in energy use of the facility or system is high, and any single 
savings determination is unreliable.  
Where you cannot meet this criterion, consider using: 
 
more precise measurement equipment,  
 
more independent variables in any mathematical model,  
 
larger sample sizes, or  
 
an IPMVP Option that is less affected by unknown variables.
