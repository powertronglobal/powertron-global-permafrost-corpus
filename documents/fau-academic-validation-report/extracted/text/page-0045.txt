The in-situ examples ran for 4 weeks under normal loads.  The four control units were 
run full time for 12 days without cycling off was ample time between the baseline and 
post measurements.  This is an extreme condition unlikely to occur in the field, but will 
mimic extreme in-situ conditions.   
 
The data is best illustrated on three graphs.  Figure 1 compares system 27% increase in 
efficiency afterward.

Permafrost addition 
 
 
 
Figure 2 compares KW draw before (x-axis) and after (y-axis) the PermaFrost NMR® 
addition.  There is a 30% increase in efficiency afterward. The final graph (Figure 3) 
shows the BTU demand before (x-axis) and after (y-axis) the PermaFrost NMR® 
addition.  This figure shows a 35% increase in available BTU capacity in units with the 
PermaFrost NMR® addition.
