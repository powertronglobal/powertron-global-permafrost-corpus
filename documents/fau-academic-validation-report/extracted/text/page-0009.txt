For any system, there is a need to insure that the HVAC system is operating correctly so that 
changes in equipment do not affect the analysis: low refrigerant, clogged exchangers etc.  A 
checklist for a unit should include: 
 
• Make a note of the condition 
• Inspect hookups at electrical panel to insure no loose connections. 
• Clean or note cleanliness level of coils 
• Measure the dampers if they are not operating correctly (it changes the running time) 
• Measure the outside fan motor amperage to ensure bearing is not going bad and pulling 
more load. 
• Check to make sure there is not a weak capacitor 
 
The protocol was as follows: 
 
• Decide on a site (thirty-eight (38) chosen, some with multiple units at one site) 
• A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the 
unit’s operational conditions were satisfactory.  
• Baseline measurements were recorded  
• The proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected.  
• PermaFrost NMR® was allowed four (4) weeks to embed itself into the metal surfaces  
• Post measurements were taken to establish the efficiency gains 
 
It was recommended that a base line of performance is to be generated after the system is 
running for at least 15 to 20 minutes. This assures that the evaporator and condenser coils have 
reached operating temperature.  After installation of PermaFroat NMR® there may be an initial 
immediate performance change although it takes almost 2-4 weeks for PermaFrost NMR® to 
properly travel throughout the hermetic circuit. The protocol was designed to allow the units to 
run wide open for 12 days (July 26-Aug 6) to expedite the seating of PermaFrost NMR® within 
the sealed refrigerant circuit. 
  
The following parameters were measured on an ongoing basis for each unit: 
 
• Voltage 
• Amperage 
• Suction refrigerant pressure and temperature 
• Discharge refrigerant pressure and temperature 
• Air temperature entering the evaporator DB and WB 
• Air temperature exiting the evaporator DB and WB 
• Air flow (CFM) 
• Evaporator coil pressure drop 
• Total static pressure 
• Refrigerant sub-cooling 
• Refrigerant superheat 
 
The following parameters were characterized before and after the PermaFrost NMR® injection 
(as applicable to HVAC air cooled or water cooled chiller units):
