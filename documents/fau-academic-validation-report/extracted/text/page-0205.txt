For A Baseline of 12 Monthly kWh and CDD Data Points the derived regression model is: 
 
 
 
Monthly electricity consumption = 5,634.15 + (7.94 x CDD) 
 
The coefficient of determination, R2, (shown as “R Square” in Table B-3) is quite high at 0.93, 
indicating that 93% of the variation in the 12 energy data points is explained by the model using 
CDD data. This fact implies a very strong relationship and that the model may be used to 
estimate adjustment terms in the relevant form of Equation 1 in Chapter 4. 
The estimated coefficient of 7.94 kWh per CDD has a standard error of 0.68. This SE leads to a 
t-statistic (shown as “T stat” in Table B-3) of 11.64. This t-statistic is then compared to the 
appropriate critical t value in Table B-1 (t = 2.2 for 12 data points and 95% confidence). 
Because 11.64 exceeds 2.2, CDD is a highly significant independent variable. The spreadsheet 
also shows that the range for the coefficient at the 95% level of confidence is 6.42 to 9.45, and 
implies a relative precision of ±19% ( = (7.94 - 6.42) / 7.94). In other words, we are 95% 
confident that each additional CDD increases kWh consumption between 6.42 and 9.45 kWh.   
The standard error of the estimate using the regression formula is 367.5. The average CDDs 
per month is 162 (not shown in output). To predict what electric consumption would have been 
under average cooling conditions, for example, this CDD value is inserted into the regression 
model:  
 
 
Predicted consumption  
= 5,634 + (7.94 x 162)  
 
 
 
 
 
= 6,920 kWh per average cooling degree day month 
 
Using a Table B-1 t-value of 2.2, for 12 data points and a 95% confidence level, the range of 
possible predictions is: 
 
 
Range of predictions = 6,920 ± (2.2 x 367.5) = 6,112 to 7,729 kWh. 
 
The absolute precision is approximately ±809 kWh ( =  2.2 x 367.5 ) and the relative precision is 
±12% ( =  809 / 6,920 ). The spreadsheet described value for the standard error of the estimate 
provided the information needed to compute the relative precision expected from use of the 
regression model for any one month, in this case 12%.
