 
Non-Routine Adjustments – for those energy-governing factors which are not usually 
expected to change, such as: the facility size, the design and operation of installed 
equipment, the number of weekly production shifts, or the type of occupants. These static 
factors must be monitored for change throughout the reporting period. See Chapter 8.2 for 
discussion of non-routine adjustments.  
 
  
Therefore Equation 1) can be expressed more fully as: 
 
Savings  =   ( Baseline Energy –  Reporting-Period Energy ) 
 
 
 
± Routine Adjustments  ±  Non-Routine Adjustments 
1a) 
 
The adjustments terms in Equation 1a) are used to express both pieces of measured energy 
data under the same set of conditions. The mechanism of the adjustments depends upon 
whether savings are to be reported on the basis of the conditions of the reporting period, or 
normalized to some other fixed set of conditions as discussed below9. 
 
                                                  
9 The following general methods can be applied to Options A, B and C described in the rest of the Chapter 4. Option 
D generally includes the adjustments within the simulation, though the set of conditions for adjustment must still be 
chosen. 
 
Static Factors 
Examples of static factors needing non-routine adjustments are changes in the:  
 
amount of space being heated or air conditioned, 
 
type of products being produced or number of production shifts per day 
 
building envelope characteristics (new insulation, windows, doors, air tightness), 
 
amount, type or use of the facility’s and the users’ equipment,  
 
indoor environmental standard (e.g. light levels, temperature, ventilation rate), 
and 
 
occupancy type or schedule.
