of 305 psi. This necessitated another measurement of the pressure drop across the condenser coil 
and this revealed that the pressure drop is continuing to measure in excess of 2". The method of 
cleaning to this coil did not produced the required relief for the system to completely condense 
all of the discharge gas. Characteristics of the HVAC system are as follows: 
 
Make – Comfort-Aire 
Model – VCP240M-3B 
Age - 2001 
Refrigerant Type – R22 
Nominal Cooling Capacity in Ton – 20 tons 
Design Air Flow – 7200 cfm 
 
Educational Institution A Location.  This is a 7.5-ton York DX Split HVAC unit. The School 
made the decision to treat the unit as it was the on the same meter as the pool unit so the school 
can monitor that meter for a reduction in kWh when adjusted for weather. This unit provides 
cooling for The School’s finance offices. Per The School, the equipment is estimated to run 
1,440 hours per year. Characteristics are as follows: 
 
Make – York 
Model –  HA090COOA2 
Age – not available 
Refrigerant Type – R22 
Nominal Cooling Capacity in Ton – 7.5 tons 
Design Air Flow – 3000 cfm 
 
Unit #1 at the REIT A Bldg. at [Commercial Address], NYC. REIT A made the decision to treat 
this unit as it was one of two supporting the 8th floor. This unit provides cooling for the Traffic 
Police Department for the City of New York on the 8nd floor of the facility. Per REIT A, the 
equipment is estimated to run 1,500 hours per year.  Both units were treated and tested. 
Characteristics are as follows:

Air Force Airlift Wing Support Center Chiller at Military Base A, MD.  This report contains specific 
information regarding the installation of the energy control measure (ECM) PermaFrost NMR® 
in chiller #3 of the main chiller plant. Detailed forensic performance testing was performed on a 
nominal 170-ton water-cooled chiller using R134A refrigerant serving the Military Air Wing, 
Building 1558 and runs 4,820 hours per year. Following testing, the unit was treated with the 
proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® product formulated for chiller systems. Given 
the 10.9% cooler outside air temperature in the Post, the compressors Amps (70% of the total 
Amps) were adjusted upward by the same amount. This adjustment permeates through to the 
Post kW as well as the kW per Ton. The results were stamped by a P.E.  Characteristics of the 
system are as follows:
