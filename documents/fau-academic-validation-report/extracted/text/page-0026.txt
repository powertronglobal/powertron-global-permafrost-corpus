Table 1 Summary of parameters Measured and Calculated and How used to Evaluate 
performance of PermaFrost NMR® 
Voltage 
Should not vary significantly since this is a 
basis for delivering power to equipment 
Amperage 
Reduce Amperage demand = higher efficiency 
devices operating properly, which reduces amp 
draw.  Expect significant decrease as friction is 
reduced 
Actual Coil Capacity Btuh 
Should increase if efficiency increases - goal is 
to have more available cooling 
Actual Coil Capacity Tons 
Better efficiency = more available cooling 
Enthalpy Delta 
Delta should increase with better efficiency 
Total Watts Normalized for Weather 
Watts should decrease as amperage decreases 
Watts Per Ton 
Should decrease as efficiency improves 
kW (volts x amps x .85 x 1.732/1000) 
Demand of HVAC system on grid - need to 
show decrease 
Adjusted Total Watts 
Watts should decrease as amperage decreases 
Btuh Coil Capacity 
Should increase if efficiency increases - goal is 
to have more available cooling 
System Efficiency 
Should increase if efficiency increases 
EER (Btuh / Watts) 
Should increase if efficiency increases
