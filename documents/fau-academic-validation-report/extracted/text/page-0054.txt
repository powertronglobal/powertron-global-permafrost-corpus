ASTM D665A: Completed Rust inhibitor. 
 
A type of additive for protecting lubricated metal surfaces against chemical attack by water or other contaminants. 
Polar compounds wet the surface preferentially, protecting it with a film of oil. 
Results: <0.5% 
 
 
ASTM D611: Completed Aniline point, °F. 
 
The lowest temperature at which a specified quantity of aniline (a benzene derivative) is soluble in a specified quantity 
of petroleum product, i.e. the solvent power of a hydrocarbon. The lower aniline point, the greater the solvency. 
Results: 11°F 
 
 
ASTM D877: Completed Dielectric breakdown, kV. 
 
The minimum voltage required to produce an electric arc through an oil sample, hence an indication of the insulating 
 
(arc preventive) properties of an oil. 
 
Results: 41 kV 
 
 
ASTM D93: Completed Flash point, °F. 
 
The lowest temperature at which the vapor of a combustible liquid can be made to ignite momentarily in air. Flash point 
is an important indicator of the fire and explosion hazards associated with petroleum products. 
Results: 370°F 
 
 
ASTM D1744: Completed Water content, PPM. 
 
A method used for obtaining a semi-quantitative estimate of the amount of trace water present in a finished lubricant. 
 
Results: 10 PPM 
 
 
ASTM D445: Completed Viscosity @ 100°F. 
 
This test measures the fluid's resistance to flow. Liquids change viscosity with temperature, becoming less viscous when 
heated. High pressures, or load, tend to squeeze the oil out of the bearing, which calls for the greater film strength of a 
high-viscosity oil. 
Results: 7.8 
 
 
ASTM D97: Completed Pour point, °F. 
 
The lowest temperature at which oil is observed to flow, when cooled under conditions as defined by ASTM D97. The 
pour point is 5°F above the temperature at which the oil in a test vessel shows no movement 
when the container is held horizontally for five seconds. 
 
Results: -70°F.
