Air Force Data Center CRAC units at Military Base A, MD.  The two primary 10-ton air-cooled 
Liebert CRAC units supporting the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Data Control 
Center at Military Base A in MD were treated. One of the CRAC units runs 24/7 for 
3,920 hours per year and the other runs 24/7 for 4,210 hours per year. Given the 9% cooler 
outside air temperature in the Post, the compressors Amps (70% of the total Amps) were 
adjusted upward by the same percentage. This adjustment permeates through to the Post Total 
Watts as well as the Watts per Ton. The results were stamped by a P.E.  Characteristics of the 
systems are as follows:

QSR Chain C, 3 locations, MI. The three units tested were all Carrier packaged rooftop units 
using R22 refrigerant and totaling 13 tons (one 5-ton unit and two 4-ton units). These units run 
approximately 5,760 hours a year. The results were normalized for cooler weather in the post and 
adjusted for capacity using a regression analysis in the baseline. The results were stamped by a 
P.E. Characteristics of the systems are as follows:
