Addition to Chapter 4.7, last paragraph. 
ASHRAE (2002) provides more technical details on a similar retrofit isolation method 
Addition to Chapter 4.7 
Specific applications of retrofit-isolation techniques to common ECMs chosen by the United 
States Department of Energy are shown in Section III of FEMP (2000). Note however that 
FEMP’s applications LE-A-01, LC-A-01 and CH-A-01 are not consistent with IPMVP because 
they require no measurement. 
ASHRAE (2002) provides more detailed specifications for a similar method.  
Addition to Chapter 4.8.1 
Chapter 2.2.1 of FEMP (2000) summarizes common duties borne by parties to an energy-
performance contract. The United States Federal Energy Management Program has also 
published Detailed Guidelines for FEMP M&V Option A (2002) giving further guidance on 
estimation issues faced by U.S. federal agencies. (Note: the FEMP guidelines call estimated 
values “stipulations.”) 
 
Addition to Chapter 4.9 
 
Resources that provide detailed methods for defining new construction baselines, include: 
ASHRAE Standard 90.1 Appendix G – Performance Rating Method, the COMNET Commercial 
Building Energy Modeling Guidelines and Procedures and the Title-24 Alternative Calculation 
Manual. In addition, it is becoming more commonplace that commercially-available simulatioin 
programs are capable of automatically generating a minimally-compliant baseline building 
based on an as-designed building model per various rating methods.  
ASHRAE (2002) provides more technical details on a similar method and on calibrating 
simulation models to utility bills.  
 
Addition to Chapter 4.9.1 
Information on building simulation programs in common use in different parts of the world can 
be found in Chapter 6.3 of ASHRAE (2002).  
 
Addition to Chapter 4.9.2, Item 5. 
ASHRAE (2002), Chapter 6.3, gives more information on calibration accuracy. 
Addition to Chapter 4.9.1 
Information on different types of building simulation models can be found in Chapter 32 of the 
ASHRAE Handbook (2005). The United States Department of Energy (DOE) also maintains a 
current list of public-domain software and proprietary building-energy-simulation programs at 
www.eren.doe.gov/buildings/tools_directory. 
ASHRAE’s simplified energy-analysis procedure may also be used if the building’s heat losses, 
heat gains, internal loads, and HVAC systems are simple.  
Other types of special-purpose programs are used to simulate energy use of HVAC 
components. See  ASHRAE’s HVAC02 toolkit (Brandemuehl 1993), and for boiler/chiller 
equipment HVAC01 toolkit (Bourdouxhe 1994a, 1994b, 1995). Simplified component air-side 
HVAC models are also available in a report by Knebel (1983). Equations for numerous other 
models have been identified as well (ASHRAE 1989, SEL 1996).
