measurement process was put in place for assessing the increased electrical output in order to 
qualify for an electric-utility incentive payment.  
Factors Affecting The M&V Design  The purpose of the M&V was to report electrical 
improvements. The mill recognized that extraction of more energy by the turbine left less steam 
energy for the process, or required more boiler energy to deliver the same steam to the process. 
These interactive effects were not part of this analysis for the electrical utility. The utility 
incentive was based purely on increased electricity production. 
M&V Plan  The mill and the utility agreed to use IPMVP Volume I, EVO 10000 – 1:2012, Option 
B to determine the increase in electricity output for a one year period. Existing plant 
instrumentation was used to determine the efficiency of the old rotor as shown in Figure A-5.1. 
 
  
The mathematical model describing the baseline unit efficiency was found by regression 
analysis to be: 
 
Efficiency (%) = (-0.000247 x flow2) + (0.255 x flow) + 14.5 
This efficiency model will be used with the steam conditions of the one-year reporting period to 
determine what the electricity production would have been with the old rotor. Increased 
electricity production will be reported under reporting-period conditions, using IPMVP Equation 
1b). 
Existing plant meters are regularly calibrated as part of plant maintenance. They were deemed 
to be suitable for the utility’s purpose. 
Results  For a year after retrofit, the steam conditions every minute were applied to the 
mathematical model of old rotor efficiency to compute the adjusted-baseline energy term used
