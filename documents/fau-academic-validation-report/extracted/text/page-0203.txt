Hours Of Use
 
 
If the proposed M&V method will yield readings of old-fixture wattage with a range of uncertainty 
of ±5%, the range of electricity savings uncertainty will be ±15%. In other words, if the old-fixture 
wattage could be between 91 and 101 watts, the savings could be between 99 and 135 kWh 
annually. The range of uncertainty on the savings is 36 kWh (135 - 99). If the marginal value of 
electricity is 10 cents per kWh, the uncertainty range is about $3.60 annually. If the wattage of 
the old fixture could be estimated with greater precision for significantly less than $3.60, then it 
may be worth enhanced-measurement efforts, depending on the number of years of savings 
being considered.  
Figure B2 shows that the hours-of-use term has less of an impact on final savings in this 
example (the hours-of-use line is flatter indicating lower sensitivity). It is plausible that the error 
in measurement of operating hours is ±20%, so the energy-savings uncertainty range is also 
±20% or ±23 kWh (= 20% of 117 kWh). The range in savings is about 46 kWh (= 2 x 23 kWh), 
worth $4.60 per year. Again it may be warranted to increase the accuracy in measuring the 
hours of use if it can be done for significantly less than $4.60, depending upon the number of 
years of savings being considered. 
The range of possible savings errors from errors in measuring operating hours (46 kWh) is 
greater than from the error in measuring the old-fixture wattages (36 kWh). This is the opposite 
effect from what might be expected based on the greater sensitivity of savings to wattage than 
to hours of use, as seen in Figure B2. This difference arises because the plausible error of 
measuring operating hours (±20%) is much larger than the plausible error of measuring old-
fixture wattages (±5%).  
Sensitivity analysis such as the above can take many forms. The preceding simple example 
was used to show the principles. Monte Carlo simulation, allows complex consideration of many 
different parameters, allowing M&V design to focus expenditures where most needed to 
improve the overall accuracy of savings reports. 
B-5.2   Establishing Targets for Quantifiable Savings Uncertainty 
As discussed in Appendix B-1, not all uncertainties can be quantified. However, those that can 
be quantified provide guidance in M&V Planning. By considering the M&V cost of various 
optional approaches to uncertainty, the M&V program can produce the type of information that 
is acceptable to all readers of the savings report, including those who have to pay for the M&V 
reports. Ultimately, any M&V Plan should report the expected level of quantifiable uncertainty 
(see Chapter 5).
