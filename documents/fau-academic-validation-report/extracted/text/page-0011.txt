SUMMARY OF SYSTEMS AND SITES 
There are sixty-one (61) units tested to demonstrate that PermaFrost NMR® provides the 
benefits advertised.  Of these four (4) units (1.5 tons each) were tested at a Juno Beach lab.  
These units all had similar conditions and can be compared against one another to determine 
potential variations between like units (see Appendix B).

The existing building (in-situ) sites are outline as follows: 
Organization A, 2nd floor, [Commercial Address], NY   This unit is a 20-ton Comfort-Aire 
DX HVAC unit.  The Company made the decision to treat the unit as it was the main unit 
supporting the office. This unit provides cooling for The Company’s design and engineering 
spaces on the 2nd floor of the facility.  
Per The Company, the equipment is estimated to run 1,800 hours per year. It was Powertron’s 
understanding that the condenser coil was cleaned by a service group to attempt to alleviate this 
condition. The post energy measurement period revealed that the discharge pressure is in excess
