A non-routine adjustment was made immediately to account for reducing the burnout rate from 
the baseline period’s 20% to the Retail Chain A reporting-period value of 3.0%. The baseline-energy was 
therefore adjusted to 2,130,000 kWh ( = 1,753,000 x 0.970 / 0.800).   
The city staff will monitor burnout rates monthly. If the burnout rate is greater than 3.0%, a non-
routine adjustment will be made to bring reporting-period metered data up to the contracted 
3.0% burnout rate.  
Savings will be reported for the length of the 10-year guarantee period using a single price of 
0.600 kuna/kWh. 
Results  Savings were reported without adjustment for the first three years after retrofit because 
burnout rates remained above 3.0%.   
For the fourth year the burnout rate was 5.0% for 7 months. Fourth year savings were computed 
as follows:

A-4  Compressed-Air Leakage Management – Option B 
Situation  A Brazilian auto manufacturer’s plant engineering department estimated that 
R$200,000 per year was being lost through compressed-air leakage arising from poor 
maintenance. The plant engineer persuaded the plant manager that the maintenance 
department should dedicate one person for two months to repair all leaks. The engineering 
department agreed to conduct ongoing monitoring of leakage rates and savings, in order to 
motivate the maintenance staff to regularly check for leakage. 
Factors Affecting M&V Design  There are very few funds available for any M&V activity. Also 
the engineering department wished any savings measurement methodology to have a 
maximum quantifiable error of ±5% in any reported savings, with a confidence level of 95%. 
The plant operates with 2 shifts per day, 10 per week and 442 per year. When it is operating, it's 
use of compressed air is steady. Heat from compressors is rejected directly outside compressor 
rooms without impacting any other plant energy-using systems. 
The local electric consumption rate (known as the “green rate”) for low-load-factor commercial 
accounts over 0.5 MW is shown in Table A-4-1.
