• Voltage relatively constant 
• Amperage dropped in the four units after PermaFrost NMR® is added by an average of 
6% 
• Air flow was constant 
• Coil Capacity increased in each system PermaFrost NMR® with an average of 16%. 
• Enthalpy delta improved in the four standard HVAC systems by an average of 16% 
• Watts per ton decreased in the four standard HVAC systems by an average of 16%, with 
a total average, adjusted wattage improvement of 1% 
• EER delta improved 18% 
• Efficiency improved 16% 
 
While the four (4) test units were tested in July - September, the question is how the in-situ 
Florida examples compare to the in-situ examples, which included installations in Brazil, South 
Africa, Florida, Michigan, Maryland, New York and Connecticut.  The Table 2 and Table 3 sites 
were entered into Table 4 for comparison purposes.  Table 5 shows the chillers.  The findings are 
that similar results were reported with both test conditions despite the differences in location.  In 
all cases efficiency of the units was improved and for most parameters the results were similar.  
Where they differed, the age and size of the in-situ systems suggest greater improvements in 
performance.
