If reporting-period consumption was 4,300 kWh, savings computed using Chapter 4, Equation 
1b) will be: 
 
 
Savings = 6,920 – 4,300 = 2,600 kWh 
 
Since the utility meter was used to obtain the reporting-period electricity value, its reported 
values may be treated as 100% accurate (SE = 0%) because the utility meter defines the 
amounts paid, regardless of meter error. The SE of the savings number will be:

Using t of 2.2, the range of possible monthly savings is  
 
 
Range of savings  
= 2,620 ± (2.2 x 367.5)  
 
 
 
 
=  2,620 ± -810  = 1,810 to 3,430 
 
To determine the precision of the annual total of monthly savings, it is assumed that the 
standard error of each month’s savings will be the same. The annual reported savings then 
have a standard error of: 
 
 
 
SE (annual savings) =

 = 1,273 kWh 
 
Since t derives from the model of the baseline, it remains at the 2.2 value used above.  
Therefore the absolute precision in annual savings is 2.2 x 1,273 = 2,801 kWh. 
Assuming equal monthly savings of 2,620 kWh, annual savings are 31,440 kWh, and the 
relative precision of the annual savings report is 9% ( = (2,801 / 31,440) x 100).
