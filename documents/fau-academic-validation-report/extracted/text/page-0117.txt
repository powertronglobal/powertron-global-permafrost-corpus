 
IPMVP Framework and Options       17 
 
Table 2 summarizes the four Options that are detailed in Chapters 4.8 through 4.10. Examples 
of the use of the Options are contained in Appendix A. Section 4.11 offers guidance on selecting 
the proper Option for any specific project. 
 
IPMVP Option 
How Savings Are 
Calculated 
Typical Applications 
A. Retrofit  Isolation: Key 
Parameter Measurement 
Savings are determined by field 
measurement of the key performance 
parameter(s) which define the energy 
use of the ECM’s affected system(s) 
and/or the success of the project.  
Measurement frequency ranges from 
short-term to continuous, depending 
on the expected variations in the 
measured parameter, and the length 
of the reporting period. 
Parameters not selected for field 
measurement are estimated. 
Estimates can based on historical 
data, manufacturer’s specifications, 
or engineering judgment. 
Documentation of the source or 
justification of the estimated 
parameter is required. The plausible 
savings error arising from estimation 
rather than measurement is 
evaluated. 
 
 
 
Engineering calculation 
of baseline and 
reporting period energy 
from: 
o short-term or 
continuous 
measurements of 
key operating 
parameter(s); and  
o estimated values.  
Routine and non-
routine adjustments as 
required. 
 
 
 
A lighting retrofit where 
power draw is the key 
performance parameter that 
is measured periodically. 
Estimate operating hours of 
the lights based on facility 
schedules and occupant 
behavior.  
 
B. Retrofit Isolation: All Parameter 
Measurement 
Savings are determined by field 
measurement of the energy use of 
the ECM-affected system. 
Measurement frequency ranges from 
short-term to continuous, depending 
on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the 
reporting period. 
 
 
 
Short-term or 
continuous 
measurements of 
baseline and reporting-
period energy, and/or 
engineering 
computations using 
measurements of 
proxies of energy use.  
Routine and non-
routine adjustments as 
required. 
 
 
Application of a variable-
speed drive and controls to a 
motor to adjust pump flow. 
Measure electric power with 
a kW meter installed on the 
electrical supply to the 
motor, which reads the 
power every minute. In the 
baseline period this meter is 
in place for a week to verify 
constant loading. The meter 
is in place throughout the 
reporting period to track 
variations in power use.
