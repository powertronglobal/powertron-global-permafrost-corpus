For example, if savings are computed using Equation 1b) of Chapter 4 as the difference 
between the adjusted-baseline energy and measured reporting-period energy, the standard 
error of the difference (savings) is computed as:

The SE (adjusted baseline) comes from the standard error of the estimate derived from 
Equation B-11.  The SE (reporting period energy) comes from the meter accuracy using 
Equation B-18. 
If the reported savings estimate is a product of several independently determined components 
(Ci) (i.e.,

A good example of this situation is the determination of lighting savings as: 
 
 
 
 
 
Savings = Δ Watts x Hours  
 
If the M&V Plan requires measurement of hours of use, then “Hours” will be a value with a 
standard error.  If the M&V Plan also includes measurement of the change in wattage, then 
ΔWatts will also be a value with a standard error. Relative standard error of savings will be 
computed using the formula above as follows:

When a number of savings results are totaled and they all have the same Standard Error, 
equation B-5 or B-19 can be used to find the estimated Standard Error of the total reported.
