B-1.3   Definitions of Statistical Terms 
Sample Mean (Y ): The most widely used measure of the central tendency of a series of 
observations. Sample mean is determined by adding up the individual data points (Yi) and 
dividing by the total number of these data points (n), as follows:

Sample Variance (S2): Sample variance measures the extent to which observed values differ 
from each other, i.e., variability or dispersion. The greater the variability, the greater the 
uncertainty in the mean. Sample variance, the most important measure of variability, is found by 
averaging the squares of the individual deviations from the mean. The reason these deviations 
from the mean are squared is simply to eliminate the negative values (when a value is below the 
mean) so they do not cancel out the positive values (when a value is above the mean). Sample 
variance is computed as follows:

Sample Standard Deviation (s): This is simply the square root of the sample variance. This 
brings the variability measure back to the units of the data (e.g., if the variance units are (kWh)2, 
the standard deviation units would be kWh).

Sample Standard Error (SE): This is the sample standard deviation divided by
n . This 
measure is used in estimating precision of a sample mean.  It is also denoted as , or the 
"sample standard deviation of the mean" in most statistics textbooks.

Sample Standard Deviation of the Total (stot):  Many times we are interested in the statistical 
properties of a total rather than a mean.  The sample standard deviation of a total is used to 
define the precision about a sample total.  It is defined as the square root of the sample size, 
, times the sample standard deviation:

Coefficent of Variation (cv):  The coefficient of variation is simply the standard deviation of a 
distribution expressed as a percentage of the mean.  For instance, the cv of a sample total
