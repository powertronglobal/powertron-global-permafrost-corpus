 
M&V Reporting       39 
 
CHAPTER 6   M&V  REPORTING  
M&V Reports should be prepared and presented as defined in the M&V Plan (Chapter 5) 
Complete M&V reports should include at least: 
 
Observed data of the reporting period: the measurement period start and end points in time, 
the energy data, and the values of the independent variables 
 
Description and justification for any corrections made to observed data 
 
For Option A the agreed estimated values 
 
Energy price schedule used 
 
All details of any baseline non-routine adjustment performed. Details should include an 
explanation of the change in conditions since the baseline period, all observed facts and 
assumptions, and the engineering calculations leading to the adjustment. 
 
Computed savings in energy and monetary units. 
M&V reports should be written to their readers’ levels of understanding. 
Energy managers should review the M&V reports with the facility’s operating staff. Such reviews 
may uncover useful information about how the facility uses energy, or where operating staff 
could benefit from more knowledge of the energy-consumption characteristics of their facility.
