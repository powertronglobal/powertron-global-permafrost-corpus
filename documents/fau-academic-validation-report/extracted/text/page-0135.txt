4.11   Persistence of Savings  
An organisation which has improved its energy efficiency is more at risk from adverse shifts in 
performance, not only because its ECMs may be of a kind that can fail, fade or be bypassed, 
but also because the additional headroom in its energy budgets may allow unrelated incidents 
of avoidable energy waste to pass unchallenged. 
Persistence of energy savings can be achieved beyond the M&V reporting period by completing 
follow on efforts that build on M&V. One approach is “Monitoring and Targeting” (M&T), which 
can seamlessly follow the M&V process. If Options B and C (see sections 4.6 above) have been 
used for verifying savings, the project will have metering in place for the routine measurement of 
consumption. More importantly, models will also have been developed that correlate energy use 
with driving factors such as weather. These same models can be ‘re-tuned’ to estimate energy 
consumption that accounts for ECM installation. This enables a periodic comparison of actual 
and expected consumption, which will readily reveal and quantify any loss of ECM effect (or 
unrelated waste) enabling prompt remedial action to be taken in cases where the unexpected 
avoidable cost is deemed significant.
