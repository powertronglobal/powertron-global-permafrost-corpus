IPMVP Option 
How Savings Are 
Calculated 
Typical Applications 
C. Whole Facility 
 
Savings are determined by 
measuring energy use at the whole 
facility or sub-facility level.  
 
Continuous measurements of the 
entire facility’s energy use are taken 
throughout the reporting period.  
 
 
 
Analysis of whole 
facility baseline and 
reporting period (utility) 
meter data. 
Routine adjustments as 
required, using 
techniques such as 
simple comparison or 
regression analysis.  
Non-routine 
adjustments as 
required. 
 
 
Multifaceted energy 
management program 
affecting many systems in a 
facility. Measure energy use 
with the gas and electric 
utility meters for a twelve 
month baseline period and 
throughout the reporting 
period.  
D. Calibrated Simulation 
 
Savings are determined through 
simulation of the energy use of the 
whole facility, or of a sub-facility.  
Simulation routines are demonstrated 
to adequately model actual energy 
performance measured in the facility. 
This Option usually requires 
considerable skill in calibrated 
simulation.  
 
 
 
Energy use simulation, 
calibrated with hourly 
or monthly utility billing 
data. (Energy end use 
metering may be used 
to help refine input 
data.)  
 
 
 
Multifaceted energy 
management program 
affecting many systems in a 
facility but where no meter 
existed in the baseline 
period. 
Energy use measurements, 
after installation of gas and 
electric meters, are used to 
calibrate a simulation.  
Baseline energy use, 
determined using the 
calibrated simulation, is 
compared to a simulation of 
reporting period energy use.  
 
4.7  Options A & B: Retrofit Isolation  
Chapter 4.4 defines the concept of a measurement boundary encompassing the retrofitted 
equipment. Retrofit isolation allows the narrowing of the measurement boundary in order to 
reduce the effort required to monitor independent variables and static factors, when retrofits 
affect only a portion of the facility. However boundaries smaller than the total facility usually 
require additional meters at the measurement boundary. Narrow measurement boundaries also 
introduce the possibility of ‘leakage’ through unmeasured interactive effects.  
Since measurement is of less than the total facility, the results of retrofit isolation techniques 
cannot be correlated to the facility’s total energy use shown on utility bills. Facility changes 
beyond the measurement boundary but unrelated to the ECM will not be reported by retrofit-
isolation techniques but will be included in the utility’s metered consumption or demand.
