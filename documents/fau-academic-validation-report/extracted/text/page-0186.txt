The input data for the as-built model was then changed to describe a building with the same 
occupancy and location but which simply meets the building-code standard. This was called the 
“standard model.” 
The standard model’s monthly predicted energy use was adjusted by the monthly calibration 
errors in Table A-9-1 to yield the “corrected-standard model.” Actual metered data for year 
one was then subtracted from the corrected-standard model to yield the monthly savings. 
Percentage savings were computed to prove eligibility for the government incentive.  
Monetary savings were determined for the owner by applying the then current full utility rate 
structure to the corrected standard model’s predicted monthly amounts. This total value was 
compared to the total utility payments for year one. 
The year one energy data became the basis for an Option C approach for subsequent years.
