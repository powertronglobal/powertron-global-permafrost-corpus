• Chiller kW;  
• Chilled Water flow in GPM 
• Condenser water flow in GPM (water cooled only) 
• Delta T across the cooler  
• Delta T across the condenser (water cooled only)  
• Operating Tonnage;  
• kW per Ton 
• Actual tonnage  
• Outdoor air temperature and humidity 
 
The following parameters were calculated for standard HVAC system site before and after 
PermaFrost NMR® injection: 
 
• kW=Volts * Amps * (1.47 single phase  OR 1.56 for 3-phase ) / 1000 
• Delta T = Return Air DB – Supply Air DB 
• Enthalpy = Return Air WB Deg. F and Supply Air WB Deg. F Converted to Enthalpy 
• Actual Btuh Capacity = Measured CFM X 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta 
• System Efficiency % = Actual Coil Capacity Btuh / Nominal Coil Capacity Btuh 
• EER = Btuh / Watts 
 
For the Chillers, the following were calculated before and after PermaFrost NMR® injection: 
 
• kW=Volts * Amps * .85 * 1.732 / 1000 
• GPM2 = GPM * Measured Pressure Drop (ft) / by Design Pressure Drop (ft) (sqd) 
• Cooling tons/hr = Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU 
• kW per Ton  = Actual kW / Actual Tonnage 
• COP = 12 / kW per ton / 3.412 
• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Water Temp – Saturated Evaporator Temp 
 
Task 2 
 
A draft report of the data developed will be created for review by Powertron Global personnel 
concerning the PermaFrost NMR® product.  Included were the results of the control tests.  
 
Task 3 
 
A final report of the data developed will be created for use with the PermaFrost NMR® product.
