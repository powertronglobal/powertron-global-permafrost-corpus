22        IPMVP Framework and Options 
 
  
When planning an Option A procedure, consider both the amount of variation in baseline energy 
and the ECM’s energy impact before establishing which parameter(s) to measure. The following 
three examples show the range of scenarios that may arise.  
 
ECM reduces a constant load without changing its operating hours. Example: industrial-
plant lighting fixtures are replaced with more efficient ones, but the operating hours of the 
lights do not change. To reasonably measure the effect of the project, fixture power levels 
should be measured in the baseline and reporting periods, while operating hours are 
estimated in the energy calculations. 
 
ECM reduces operating hours while load is unchanged. Example: automatic controls shut 
down air compressors during unoccupied periods. To reasonably measure the effect of the 
project, compressors’ operating time should be measured in both the baseline and reporting 
periods, while compressors’ power can be estimated in the energy calculations. 
 
ECM reduces both equipment load and operating hours. Example: Resetting of temperature 
on a hot-water radiation system reduces overheating and induces occupants to close 
windows, thereby reducing boiler load and operating periods. When both load and operating 
periods are variable and uncertain, Option A cannot be used. 
Generally, conditions of variable load or variable operating hours require more rigorous 
measurement and computations.   
Option A: Calculations 
General Equation 1) in Chapter 4.1 is used in all IPMVP adherent computations. However under 
Option A, there may be no need for adjustments, routine or non-routine, depending upon the 
location of the measurement boundary, the nature of any estimated values, the length of the 
reporting period, or the amount of time between baseline measurements and reporting-period 
measurements.  
Similarly baseline or reporting-period energy measurements involve measurement of only one 
parameter under Option A, and estimation of the other. Therefore Equation 1) may simplify 
down to:
