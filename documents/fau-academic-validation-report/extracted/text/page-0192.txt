Table B-1 shows that “t” is 1.80 for 12 data points (DF = 11) and a 90% confidence level.

So, there is 90% confidence that the true mean-monthly consumption lies in the range between 
923 and 1,077 kWh.  It can be said with 90% confidence that the mean value of the 12 
observations is 1,000 ±7.7%. Similarly it could be said: 
 
with 95% confidence that the mean value of the 12 observations is 1,000 ±9.5%, or 
 
with 80% confidence that the mean value of the 12 observations is 1,000 ±5.8%, or 
 
with 50% confidence that the mean value of the 12 observations is 1,000 ±3.0%. 
B-2   Modeling 
Mathematical modeling is used in M&V to prepare the routine-adjustments term in the various 
versions of Equation 1 in Chapter 4. Modeling involves finding a mathematical relationship 
between dependent and independent variables. The dependent variable, usually energy, is 
modeled as being governed by one or more independent variable(s) Xi, (also known as 
‘explanatory’ variables). This type of modeling is called regression analysis.  
In regression analysis, the model attempts to “explain” the variation in energy resulting from 
variations in the individual independent variables (Xi). For example, if one of the X’s is 
production level, the model would assess whether the variation of energy from its mean is 
caused by changes in production level. The model quantifies the causation. For example, when 
production increases by one unit, energy consumption increases by “b” units, where “b” is called 
the regression coefficient.   
The most common models are linear regressions of the form:  
 
 
 
 
Y = bo + b1X1 + b2X2 + ….. + bpXp + e 
 
where: 
 
 
Y is the dependent variable, usually in the form of energy use during a specific time period 
(e.g., 30 days, 1 week, 1 day, 1 hour, etc.) 
 
Xit (i = 1, 2, 3, … p) represents the ‘p’ independent variables such as weather, production, 
occupancy, metering period length, etc. 
 
bi (i = 0, 1, 2, … p) represents the coefficients derived for each independent variable, and 
one fixed coefficient (b0) unrelated to the independent variables 
 
e represents the residual errors that remain unexplained after accounting for the impact of 
the various independent  variables. Regression analysis finds the set of bi values that 
minimizes the sum of squared residual-error terms (thus regression models are also called 
least-squares models).   
An example of the above model for a building’s energy use is:
