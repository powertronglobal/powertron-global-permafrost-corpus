Factors Affecting M&V Design  Computer simulation was used extensively throughout the 
building design process to help meet a Retail Chain A energy use equal to 50% of code.  
The building was built as the new corporate headquarters for a large firm. It was expected that 
the building would become fully occupied immediately after opening.  
The owner wished to use the same energy-savings calculations that he presents to the 
government to show how much money was being saved as a result of his extra investment in an 
efficient building. He also wished to annually review variances from his initially achieved energy 
performance. 
M&V Plan   IMPVP Volume I, EVO 10000 – 1:2012, Option D will be used to demonstrate the 
new building’s savings compared to an identical building built to building-code standards. It is 
possible to use either Equation 1f) comparing two simulations, or Equation 1g) comparing the 
simulated baseline energy and measured actual energy after correcting for calibration error. The 
incentive program did not specify which method should be used. The person performing the 
modeling felt that Equation 1f) would be more accurate. However the owner wished to use 
actual utility data in his final savings statement, so he required the use of Equation 1g).30 
Following the first year of full operation (“year one”), year one’s energy and operational data will 
become the baseline for an IPMVP Volume I, EVO 10000 – 1:2012, Option C approach to 
reporting ongoing performance. 
Results  A year after commissioning and full occupancy, the original design simulation’s input 
data was updated to reflect the as-built equipment and the current occupancy. A weather-data 
file was chosen from available weather files for the building’s location based on the file’s 
similarity of total heating and cooling degree days with year one’s measured degree days. This 
similar file was appropriately adjusted to year one’s actual monthly heating and cooling degree 
days. The revised input data was used to rerun the simulation. 
The utility consumption data from year one was compared to this simulation model. After some 
further revisions to the simulation’s input data, it was deemed that the simulation reasonably 
modeled the current building. This calibrated simulation was called the “as-built model.” 
The calibration error in the as-built model relative to actual utility data is shown in Table A-9-1.
