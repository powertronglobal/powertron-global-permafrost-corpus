motors. To make the final payment of the subsidy, the utility required short-term demonstration 
of avoided energy use in a form that adheres to IPMVP.  The owner is interested in replacing his 
old pumps and reducing energy costs, so he paid for the balance of the installation costs and 
agreed to provide data to the utility after retrofit.  
Factors Affecting the M&V Design  Pump electricity metering is by 5 utility owned 
consumption meters. These meters serve only the 10 pumps. Before implementation of the 
project it was considered possible that the new pumps might enhance pumping rates at some 
wells, so that pumping hours could be reduced. The owner and the utility recognize that 
operating hours and therefore savings depend upon the growing conditions and rainfall each 
year. Neither party has control over these energy-governing variables.  
The owner sought the lowest possible cost for gathering and reporting information to the utility. 
The owner hired a contractor to select and install pumps that met his and the utility’s 
specifications.  
Pump flow is constant when operating because there are no restricting valves and well depth is 
largely unaffected by the pumping. 
M&V Plan  The M&V Plan was jointly developed by the owner and utility, following a model 
provided by the utility. IPMVP Volume I, EVO 10000 – 1:2012, Option A was selected to 
minimize M&V costs. The agreed Option A method is to negotiate an estimate of the annual 
pump operating hours for a normal year, and multiply that number by measured power 
reductions.  
It was agreed that the installation contractor’s measurement equipment would be adequately 
accurate to measure motor wattage requirements. Before removal, the contractor measured the 
power draw of each old motor after it had been running for at least 3 hours. The utility company 
maintained the right to witness these measurements. Since the pumps are constant-flow, 
average annual operating hours were derived from the billed electricity kWh consumption of the 
past year divided by the measured kW power draw of the old pump motors. This computation 
showed that on average the pumps operated for 4,321 hours in the dry year before retrofit. The 
utility found data revealing that total rainfall during that dry season was 9.0% less than normal. 
The owner and utility therefore agreed that pump operation during that year was 9.0% longer 
than normal. They agreed that normal hours would be 91.0% of 4,321, or 3,93222 hours per 
year.  
Results  The energy savings were determined using IPMVP Option A, Equation 1d) as follows: 
 
Total load of all pumps before retrofit: 
132 kW 
Total load of all pumps after retrofit:    
98.2 kW 
Net load reduction: 
   
 
 
33.8 kW23 
Energy savings: = 34 kW x 3,932 hours/year = 130,000 kWh/year24 
 
The utility company’s final payment of its subsidy was based on 130,000 kWh energy savings. 
                                                  
22 Note this 3,932 number should be expressed with only 3 significant digits, since 91.0% has only 3 significant digits. 
It should more correctly be expressed as 3.93 x 103. However common form is used.  
23 The actual calculated number of 33.8 should be treated as having 2 significant digits. This statement is made 
because the subtraction that led to the 33.8 should show no more digits to the right of the decimal than the number 
with the fewest to its right (132 has none, so 34 has none). 
24 The products of 34 and 3,932 have only 2 significant digits. Though the result is133,688, the proper expression of 
their product is 1.3 x 105, or 130,000.
