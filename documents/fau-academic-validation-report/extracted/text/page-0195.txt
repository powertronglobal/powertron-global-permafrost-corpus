  where:  
 
^
iY  = model predicted energy value for a particular data point using the measured value of 
the independent variable (i.e., obtained by plugging the X values into the regression model) 
 
Y  = mean of the n measured energy values, found using equation B-1 
 
Yi = actual observed (e.g., using a meter) value of energy  
All statistical packages and spreadsheet regression-analysis tools compute the value of R2. 
The range of possible values for R2 is 0.0 to 1.0.  An R2 of 0.0 means none of the variation is 
explained by the model, therefore the model provides no guidance in understanding the 
variations in Y (i.e., the selected independent variable(s) give no explanation of the causes of 
the observed variations in Y). On the other hand, an R2 of 1.0 means the model explains 100% 
of the variations in Y, (i.e., the model predicts Y with total certainty, for any given set of values of 
the independent variable(s)). Neither of these limiting values of R2 is likely with real data.  
In general, the greater the coefficient of determination, the better the model describes the 
relationship of the independent variables and the dependent variable. Though there is no 
universal standard for a minimum acceptable R2 value, 0.75 is often considered a reasonable 
indicator of a good causal relationship amongst the energy and independent variables. 
The R2 test should only be used as an initial check. Models should not be rejected or accepted 
solely on the basis of R2. Finally, a low R2 is an indication that some relevant variable(s) are not 
included, or that the functional form of the model (e.g., linear) is not appropriate. In this situation 
it would be logical to consider additional independent variables or a different functional form.  
B-2.2.2   Standard Error of the Estimate  
When a model is used to predict an energy value (Y) for given independent variable(s), the 
accuracy of the prediction is measured by the standard error of the estimate (SEY). This 
accuracy measure is provided by all standard regression packages and spreadsheets.  
Once the value(s) of independent variable(s) are plugged into the regression model to estimate 
an energy value (Y

), an approximation of the range of possible values for Y

 can be computed 
using equation B-8 as:
