44        Other Common M&V Issues 
 
Establish the users’ acceptable savings accuracy during the M&V Planning process. Chapter 
8.5 discusses some issues in establishing the correct level of uncertainty for any ECM or 
project. Appendix B-1.2 defines how large savings must be, relative to statistical variations in 
baseline data, for M&V reports to be valid.  
The accuracy of any measured value is properly expressed as the range within which we expect 
the true value to fall, with some level of confidence.  For example, a meter may measure 
consumption as 5,000 units with a precision of ±100 units, and a confidence of 95%. Such 
statement means that 95% of the readings of the same true value are expected to be between 
4,900 and 5,100 units.   
In a savings determination, it is feasible to quantify many uncertainty factors but usually not all 
of them. Therefore when planning an M&V process, you report both quantifiable uncertainty 
factors and also qualitative elements of uncertainty. The objective is to recognize and report all 
uncertainty factors, either qualitatively or quantitatively. 
When you describe precision within any savings report, report the savings with no more 
significant digits than the least number of significant digits in metered quantities, estimates or 
constants used in the quantification process. See Chapter 8.12. 
8.4  Cost 
The cost of determining savings depends on many factors such as: 
 
IPMVP Option selected, 
 
the number of ECMs and the complexity and amount of interaction among them, 
 
number of energy flows across the measurement boundary in Options A, B, or D when 
applied to a system only, 
 
level of detail and effort associated with establishing baseline conditions needed for the 
Option selected, 
 
amount and complexity of the measurement equipment (design, installation, maintenance, 
calibration, reading, removal), 
 
sample sizes used for metering representative equipment,  
 
amount of engineering required to make and support the estimations used in Options A or 
D, 
 
number and complexity of independent variables which are accounted for in mathematical 
models, 
 
duration of the reporting period, 
 
accuracy requirements, 
 
savings report requirements, 
 
process of reviewing or verifying reported savings, and 
 
experience and professional qualifications of the people conducting the savings 
determination. 
M&V costs should be appropriate for the size of expected savings, the length of the ECM 
payback period, and the report users’ interests in accuracy, frequency, and the duration of the 
reporting process. Often these costs can be shared with other objectives such as real time 
control, operational feedback, or tenant or departmental sub-billing. Prototype or research 
projects may bear a larger than normal M&V cost, for the sake of accurately establishing the 
savings generated by ECMs which will be repeated. However IPMVP is written to provide many
