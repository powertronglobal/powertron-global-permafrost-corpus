38        M&V Plan Contents 
 
Depending upon the circumstances of each project, some additional specific topics should also 
be discussed in a complete M&V Plan: 
For Option A: 
 
Justification of Estimates   Report the values to be used for all estimated values. Explain 
the source of these estimated values. Show the overall significance of these estimates to 
the total expected savings by reporting the range of the possible savings associated with the 
range of plausible values of the estimated parameters.  
 
Periodic Inspections  Define the periodic inspections that will be performed in the reporting 
period to verify that equipment is still in place and operating as assumed when determining 
the estimated values. 
For Option D: 
 
Software Name  Report the name and version number of the simulation software to be 
used.  
 
Input/Output Data   Provide a paper and electronic copy of the input files, output files, and 
weather files used for the simulation. 
 
Measured Data   Note which input parameters were measured and which were estimated. 
Describe the process of obtaining any measured data.  
 
Calibration   Report the energy and operating data used for calibration. Report the 
accuracy with which the simulation results match the calibration energy data.  
Where the nature of future changes can be anticipated, define methods for making the relevant 
non-routine adjustments. 
Time and budget requirements (item 11, above) are often underestimated, which leads to 
incomplete data collection. A less accurate and less expensive savings determination is better 
than an incomplete or poorly done determination, which is theoretically more accurate but 
under-funded. Chapter 8.5 addresses cost/benefit tradeoffs. 
Issues arising in developing M&V Plans are discussed in the examples shown in Appendix A. 
The website of Efficiency Valuation Organization (www.evo-world.org) contains a growing 
selection of sample M&V Plans.
