4. The post-retrofit normal-conditions model was then adjusted to remove the ECMs. This 
“baseline normal-conditions model” was archived, with both printed and electronic copy of 
input data, diagnostic reports and output data.   
5. The energy consumption of the two normal models were then compared using Equation 1f) 
to yield energy savings as shown in Table A-8-1.

6. The value of the savings at the campus meter were computed as shown in Table A-8-2, 
allowing for transformation and line losses, and contract minimum gas quantities.

A-9  New Building Designed Better Than Code – Option D 
Situation  A new building was designed to use less energy than required by the local building 
code. In order to qualify for a government incentive payment, the owner was required to show 
that the building’s energy use during the first year of operation after commissioning and full 
occupancy was less than 60% of what it would have been if it had been built to code.
