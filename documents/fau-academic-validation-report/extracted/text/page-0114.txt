Reporting-Period Basis or Avoided Energy Use 
When savings are reported under the conditions of the reporting period, they can also be called 
avoided energy use of the reporting period. Avoided energy use quantifies savings in the 
reporting period relative to what energy use would have been without the ECM(s).  
When reporting savings under reporting-period conditions, baseline-period energy needs to be 
adjusted to reporting-period conditions.  
For this common style of savings reporting Equation 1a) can be restated as: 
 
Avoided Energy Use (or Savings)  =   
( Baseline Energy   Routine Adjustments to reporting-period conditions  
 Non-Routine Adjustments to reporting-period conditions ) -  Reporting-Period Energy  
 
This equation is often simplified to the following: 
 
Avoided Energy Use  (or Savings)  =   
 
Adjusted-Baseline Energy – Reporting-Period Energy  
 
 Non-Routine Adjustments of baseline energy to reporting-period conditions     
1b) 
 
Where Adjusted-Baseline Energy is defined as the baseline energy plus any routine 
adjustments needed to adjust it to the conditions of the reporting period.  
The adjusted-baseline energy is normally found by first developing a mathematical model which 
correlates actual baseline energy data with appropriate independent variable(s)in the baseline 
period. Each reporting period’s independent variable(s) are then inserted into this baseline  
mathematical model to produce the adjusted-baseline energy use.
