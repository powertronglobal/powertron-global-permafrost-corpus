Assuming the lighting savings are achieved uniformly over a 10 month period, the typical winter 
month electrical savings are 384,000/10 = 38,400 kWh/month.  The associated boiler load 
increase is 6.0% of these electrical savings for November through March, namely: 
 
=  6.0% x 38,400 kWh/mo x 5.0 months  =  12,000 kWh 
Extra boiler input energy is: 
 
=  12,000 kWh / 79% = 6.0% x 38,400 kWh/mo x 5.0 months / 79% = 15,000 kWh 
equivalent units of fuel input. 
The gas being used in the boiler has an energy content of 10.499 kWh/m3, so the amount of 
extra gas is = 15,000  / 10.499 = 1,400 m3 gas  
The value of the extra gas used in winter is 1,400 x $0.255 = CDN$360. Therefore total net 
savings are $39,500 – $360 = CDN$39,100.   
A-3-1  Lighting Operational Control – Option A 
Situation  A knitting mill in southern India typically operates 2 shifts per day. There was a 
standing order for the supervisors to turn off all lights in each zone at the end of the second 
shift. There are 70 light switches. Supervisors regularly changed between working on the first 
and second shifts. They habitually forgot their duty to turn off lights.  
The plant manager undertook a project to modify the lighting so that occupancy sensors turned 
lights on and off. He wanted to document the results to show the supervisors how poorly they 
had been using the light switches.  
Factors Affecting M&V Design  None of the production area had windows or skylights. It is 
neither heated nor cooled. Lighting circuits are integrated with other electrical loads so that 
lighting use could not be easily isolated from other uses of electricity. 
The plant manager did not wish to spend a lot to determine savings, but needed a credible 
statement of the savings. 
The electricity price for medium sized commercial users is 450 p/kWh. 
M&V Plan  To minimize M&V costs it was decided to perform savings measurements for only a 
short representative period and use IPMVP Volume I, EVO 10000 – 1:2012, Option A. Since the 
primary purpose of the retrofit was to control production area lighting hours, a sampling based 
method was developed to measure the change in operating hours. The lighting power (for use in 
Equation 1d)) was estimated from manufacturers’ ratings to be 223 kW.  
Lighting loggers were placed randomly around the production area to record the operating hours 
of randomly chosen lighting zones. The number of loggers was chosen as follows, to obtain an 
overall precision in operating period estimates of ±10%, at 90% confidence. It was expected that 
the mean operating hours before installation of the occupancy sensors would be 125 hours per 
week, and that the standard deviation in readings would be 25. Therefore the initially estimated 
cv is 0.20 and the necessary number of samples (with z of 1.96) is 15 (Equation B-16). Since 
there are only 70 zones, the finite population adjustment lowers the estimated required number 
of loggers to 12 (Equation B-17). It was assumed that after installation of occupancy sensors the 
cv will be much lower so the 12 loggers will be adequate. 
There are no interactive effects of this retrofit on other building loads because the plant is 
neither heated nor air-conditioned. The reduction in night-time lighting is expected to make the 
building more thermally comfortable at the beginning of the morning shift. 
Results  After a one month period, data was gathered from the loggers and the average weekly 
operating hours computed for the 12 zones. The mean value was 115 and the standard 
deviation was 29. Therefore the cv was 0.24 ( = 29 / 115 ), higher than the expected value and 
worse than necessary to meet the precision requirement. Therefore another month of recording 
was undertaken. Then the mean of the eight weeks of average weekly values was 118, and the
