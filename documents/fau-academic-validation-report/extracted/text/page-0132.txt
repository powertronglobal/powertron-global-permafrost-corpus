used: a) to calibrate an Option D simulation model, and b) to establish an Option C baseline for 
measuring additional savings (or losses) in the second year and beyond. 
4.9.5 Option D: Best Applications  
Option D is usually used where no other Option is feasible.  
Option D is best applied where: 
 
Either baseline energy data or reporting-period energy data, but not both, are unavailable or 
unreliable.  
 
There are too many ECMs to assess using Options A or B.  
 
The ECMs involve diffuse activities, which cannot easily be isolated from the rest of the 
facility, such as operator training or wall and window upgrades.  
 
The performance of each ECM will be estimated individually within a multiple-ECM project, 
but the costs of Options A or B are excessive.  
 
Interactions between ECMs or ECM interactive effects are complex, making the isolation 
techniques of Options A and B impractical.  
 
Major future changes to the facility are expected during the reporting period, and there is no 
way to track the changes and/or account for their impact on energy use.  
 
An experienced energy-simulation professional is able to gather appropriate input data to 
calibrate the simulation model.  
 
The facility and the ECMs can be modeled by well documented simulation software. 
 
Simulation software predicts metered calibration data with acceptable accuracy.  
 
Only one year’s performance is measured, immediately following installation and 
commissioning of the energy-management program.   
4.10   Option Selection Guide  
The selection of an IMPVP Option is a decision that is made by the designer of the M&V 
program for each project, based on the full set of project conditions, analysis, budgets and 
professional judgment. Figure 4 outlines common logic used in Option selection.
