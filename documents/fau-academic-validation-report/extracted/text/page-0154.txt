π = 31.5  (3 significant digits in the input generates 3 in the output) 
 
In order to insure consistency and repeatability, all calculations should be carried out by 
arithmetic operation before applying these rules.  For instance, if a motor, running at a constant 
32.1 kW ran for 4,564 hrs annually and the utility rate was $0.0712 per kWh, the cost of the 
electrical energy is NOT ...

Please also note that the significant digit rules do not mix well together.  Carry out all 
calculations by “arithmetic operation” before proceeding to the next operation type. 
 
8.12.2  SPECIAL CASES 
Some numbers are represented with finite significant digits even though they can be treated as 
exact.  Exact numbers have infinite significant digits.  An example of an exact number could be 
a utility rate.  If a local power company’s rate was $0.06 per kWh and Company X used 
725,691.0 kWhs one month, the utility bill would be $43,541.46, not $40,000 per the 
multiplication rule above.  This is because the utility rate is exact … it can be represented as 
 per kWh.  There is no measurement error associated with utility rates. 
Another example includes time variables.  If Company X was guaranteed energy savings of  
$1.15M per year for 3 years, the total savings would be $3.45M, not $3M.  Unless expressed as 
a decimal number, a time variable should be considered as exact. 
Care must be taken to recognize these numbers in M&V calculations else the precision of the 
result may be compromised.
