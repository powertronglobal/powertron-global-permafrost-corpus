 
Introduction to IPMVP       3 
 
 
Chapter 8 reviews a variety of common M&V issues that need to be considered in any M&V 
program. A key issue governing the design and operation of an M&V system is the 
competing needs for reasonable accuracy and reasonable cost. Each user must find its own 
balance between the accuracy and cost of reporting. Chapter 8.5 particularly focuses on the 
factors involved in this tradeoff. Appendix B provides an overview of some uncertainty and 
statistical methods, but this overview is not a definitive text on the topic. Users are advised 
to seek appropriate statistical design help for any M&V program data normalization, 
sampling or uncertainty evaluation techniques they may use. Chapter 8 also presents 
design issues surrounding metering for M&V programs, though it is not a definitive text on 
metering.

Chapter 10 lists useful readings, references, and other sources of useful material. 
Though the application of IPMVP is unique to each project, certain types of users will have 
similar methods in their M&V Plans and implementation. Appendix D.1 through D.10 point out 
some of the key ways this document may be used by the following user groups: 
 
Energy performance contractors and their building customers  
 
Energy performance contractors and their industrial process customers  
 
Energy users doing their own retrofits and wanting to account for savings 
 
Facility managers properly accounting for energy budget variances 
 
New building designers  
 
New building designers seeking recognition for the sustainability of their designs  
 
Existing building managers seeking recognition for the environmnetal quality of their building 
operations 
 
Utility demand side management program designers and managers 
 
Water efficiency project developers 
 
Emission reduction trading program designers 
 
Energy user’s seeking ISO 50001 certification 
Financial backers and purchasers of emission credits from any of the above applications will 
find the key ways to use this document under these same headings.   
This Chapter uses terms explained in subsequent Chapters as noted in brackets, or as defined 
in Chapter 9 for italicized words.
