School board officials deemed this measurement precision adequate.   
Before estimating values for all schools, it was decided to add 6 hours per week to classroom 
hours because of plans to increase night school classes.  Considering that there are 39 school 
weeks and 13.2 holiday weeks in an average year (with leap years), the estimated annual 
operating hours were agreed to be as follows:

Since the lighting retrofit was applied uniformly to all fixtures, the load-weighted average 
estimated annual operating hours for this school were determined to be 2,996, or 3,000 rounded 
to 3 significant digits (a better representation of the result would be 3.00 × 103).  
 
Baseline power measurements were made with a recently calibrated true rms watt meter of 
the three-phase power draw on the 347-volt lighting circuits. From a thirty-second 
measurement on the input side of two lighting transformers, it was found that with all fixtures 
switched on, the total power draw was 288 kW. Seventy lamps (= 3 kW or 1%) were burned 
out at the time of the test. It was determined that the fraction burned out at the time of this 
measurement was normal. 
 
Since lighting loads establish the building electrical peak at a time when all lights are on, 
electrical demand savings will be estimated to be the same as the measured load reduction 
on the lighting circuits. The utility bills showed a lower demand during the summer holidays, 
and there was minimal use of the facility during these months. Also considering which other 
equipment was used during the summer, it was assumed that the July and August lighting-
circuit demand is only 50% of the peak measured circuit load. 
 
The marginal utility prices at the time of contract signing was CDN$0.063/kWh, 
CDN$10.85/kW-month, and CDN$0.255/m3 of gas. 
Results  After installation of the ECM, the lighting circuit power was re-measured as in the 
baseline test.  The power draw was 162 kW with all lights on and none burned out.  With the 
same 1% burnout rate as in the base year, the post-retrofit period maximum power would be 
160. kW (=162 x 0.990). Therefore the power reduction is 288. – 160. = 128 kW. 
Energy savings (using Equation 1d) with no adjustments) are 128 kW x 3.00 × 103 hrs/year = 
384,000 kWh/year.  
Demand savings are 128 kW for 10.0 months and 64 kW for 2.0 months, for a total of 1,410 kW-
months. 
The value of the electrical savings estimated under IPMVP Option A is: 
 
( 384,000 kWh  x  $0.0630 )  +  ( 1,410  x $10.85 )  =  CDN$39,500
