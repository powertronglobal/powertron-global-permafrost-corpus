Rules for significant digits are derived from the "total derivative" concept from calculus.  
Expressed as a function of two variables, the total derivative is,

3.2) 
From equation 3.2, we can calculate the limits of absolute error. The rules for significant digits 
agree with equation 3.2 when the absolute error is greater than or equal to ±1 unit of the 
smallest significant digit. 
To calculate the significant digits of a number, simply count the number of digits ignoring any 
leading zeros or trailing zeros terminating at the “ones” column (without a decimal point).  Any 
trailing zeros to the right or left of a decimal point are considered significant.

X + Y 
Round (up or down as appropriate) the result at the right-most decimal 
place (lowest unit) where all numbers have a common digit.  The number 
of significant digits will be the total of the digits of the result.

X × Y 
The number of significant digits in the result equals the smallest number 
of significant digits of any one of the input numbers.

The number of significant digits equals the number of significant digits in 
the input. 
 
8.12.1  EXAMPLES 
Numbers: 
 
00123 → 3 significant digits. 
 
12300 → 3 significant digits (because it is represented as 1.23 × 104). 
 
12300. → 5 significant digits (because it can be represented as 1.2300 × 104). 
 
12300.000 → 8 significant digits. 
 
12300.012 → 8 significant digits.
