A variety of systems were tested at the \nlocation ranging from .75 to 2 tons.\nAs demonstrated in this ﬁeld trial, PermaFrost NMR® restores the capacity lost over time due to fouling of the heat \nexchange surfaces. This improvement in thermal performance will manifest itself in any or all of the following ways:\n \n• Restored additional capacity produces colder, drier air to better satisfy room and suite loads\n \n• Improved system efﬁciency, lowering cost to produce each ton of cooling required (i.e., kW/ton)     \n \n• Restored thermal efﬁciency, reducing runtime and extending useful equipment life by 15% or more\nThe improvements demonstrated in this or any ﬁeld test resulting from PermaFrost NMR® are dependent on \nfactors such as age, condition, service history, runtime of one or both compressors and the design and \napplication of each system. The results in this pilot were very consistent with 10-year historical performance \naverages as well as the recent laboratory study completed in May, 2015 by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) in their \ntesting chambers in [Texas Location], TX.\nSummary of Financial Beneﬁts Generated \nThe Major Hotel Chain Surf Club, the Major Hotel Chain Ocean Club and the Major Hotel Chain Resort will realize the following ﬁnancial beneﬁts \nfrom investing a combined $1,650 on the installation of PermaFrost NMR® in the seven HVAC systems included in \nthis study:\n \n1.

Determine that the “as-is” capacity and efﬁciency of the seven pilot systems supporting the \n \naforementioned Major Hotel Chain Vacation facilities had substantially degraded after an average of 9 years in \n \noperation, costing Major Hotel Chain more money in energy to run them and more money in Capital Expenditures  \n \nto replace equipment prematurely.\n \n2. Verify that an average performance improvement of 10% or more in both tonnage and kW/ton  \n \noccurred across all seven of pilot cooling systems due to the installation of PermaFrost NMR®.  A lower \n \nkW/ton efﬁciency ratio reduces the cost of running these climate control systems for each ton of cooling \n \nproduced.\n \n3. Verify that every system is producing cooler, drier air as measured in both Dry Bulb and Wet Bulb \n \ndeltas following the installation of the PermaFrost NMR® technology.\n \n4. Determine that the ﬁnancial beneﬁts associated with restored capacity and efﬁciency improvements \n \nrealized over the duration of the study in terms of energy cost savings and capital improvements \n \ntranslate into a positive business case with an annual ROI of 18 months or less.\nThe multiple cooling systems involved in the study are recorded as follows:\n \nHVAC Equipment Manufacturer, 2006, Model #GEHB01811N02, Serial #W06B09216, R22 (Suite 9209)\n \nHVAC Equipment Manufacturer, 2006, Model #GEHB00911N02, Serial #W05M62613, R22 (Suite 9210)\n \nHVAC Equipment Manufacturer, 2006, Model #GEHB01811N02, Serial #W06B09215, R22 (Suite 2807)\n \nHVAC Equipment Manufacturer, 2006, Model #GEHB00911N02, Serial #W05M62612, R22 (Suite 2808)\n \nClimate Master, 2011, Model #TCH024AGX, Serial #N11022062, R410 (Suite 5461)\n \nClimate Master, 2011, Model #TCH012ABX, Serial #N11021964, R410 (Suite 5460)\n \nMitsubishi, 2011, Model #MUY-GE18NA, Serial #3001227T, R410 (Casino IT Room)\n3\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 686, "chars": 2665, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_076_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_076_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:dcebe5f583bd376fd652f45f027a36714438e577ee4fe7b69c7083794739c315"}

The pilot systems produced a combined 7.22 \n \ntons of cooling in the baseline and 9.04 tons following the installation of PermaFrost NMR® equating to  \n \nan increase of 25.2% \n \n• The average cost to produce each ton of cooling on the pilot systems dropped 25.8% from 1.24 \n \nkW/ton in the baseline to .92 kW/ton.\n \n• The average Coefﬁcient of Performance (COP) of the pilot systems improved 33.8% from an average of  \n \n2.99 in the baseline to 4.00.\n \n• The cost to treat all seven of the pilot systems of $1,650 divided by the annual savings achieved of  \n \n$3,237 results in an average payback period of 6.1 months.\nECM Product Brief\nPermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented surface science nanotechnology that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative \n(NMR®) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, one-time installation with no down time required, PermaFrost \nNMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type of climate control system in which it is installed. The direct beneﬁts of \nPermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling efﬁciency and increased capacity.\nMethodology\nAfter verifying the amount of air ﬂowing across the evaporator coils before beginning each pilot, the subsequent \nmeasurements used in the efﬁciency calculations were collected using AHRI Standards 210/240 and compiled in \naccordance with Option B of the IPMVP (International Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol) framework.\nThe results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic \nengineering formulas:\n \n• kW = (Volts * Amps * Power Factor * Sq Rt of 3) /1000 (for 3-Phase)\n \n• kW/ton = Actual Measured Energy / Actual Measured Capacity\n \n• Coefﬁcient of Performance (COP) = 12 / (kW/ton) / 3.412\n \n• Actual Cooling Capacity per Hour = (Measured CFM * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta T) / 12,000 BTU\n4\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 626, "chars": 2482, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_076_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_076_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:cfcdb3e6cd941c52a0841c7a8340adaf7be655bc20f3053c7eb6fed8a9fc5e36"}

It is the HVAC industry’s standard of \ndetermining how much energy is required to create a \nsingle ton of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you \nreduce your unit cost of cooling you are saving energy \nregardless of how much overall cooling you require.\nThe chart to the right clearly illustrates the amount of \nefﬁciency restoration the ECM created in the seven pilot \nsystems six weeks after installation. The treated pilot \nsystems are now performing 25.8% more efﬁciently than \nbefore being treated.

Working \ntogether, these improvements reduce the annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from \ndetermining what the cost to run the cooling systems was when operating at the original energy proﬁle to \nproduce the newly restored amount of available capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the cooling \nsystems at the same restored capacity after the PermaFrost NMR® was installed. This regression analysis is the \nmost widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or load % at which the systems \nwill now operate due to the restored performance proﬁle. This restored performance proﬁle allows the cooling \nsystems to satisfy the internal area set points with increased efﬁciency resulting in reduced compressor demand \nloading.  \n9\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\n10\nCertiﬁcation\n[Engineering Consultant], P.E., for EET reviewed the testing and data collection methodology used in this pilot and \nattests to the integrity and accuracy of the data pre and post PermaFrost NMR® treatment.\nPlace P.E.
