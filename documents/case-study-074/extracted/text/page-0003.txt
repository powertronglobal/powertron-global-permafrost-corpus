Objectives
The PermaFrost NMR® study was conducted by Energy Efﬁcient Technologies achieved four objectives:
 
1. Determine that the “as-is” capacity and efﬁciency of the seven pilot systems supporting the 
 
aforementioned Major Hotel Chain Vacation facilities had substantially degraded after an average of 9 years in 
 
operation, costing Major Hotel Chain more money in energy to run them and more money in Capital Expenditures  
 
to replace equipment prematurely.
 
2. Verify that an average performance improvement of 10% or more in both tonnage and kW/ton  
 
occurred across all seven of pilot cooling systems due to the installation of PermaFrost NMR®.  A lower 
 
kW/ton efﬁciency ratio reduces the cost of running these climate control systems for each ton of cooling 
 
produced.
 
3. Verify that every system is producing cooler, drier air as measured in both Dry Bulb and Wet Bulb 
 
deltas following the installation of the PermaFrost NMR® technology.
 
4. Determine that the ﬁnancial beneﬁts associated with restored capacity and efﬁciency improvements 
 
realized over the duration of the study in terms of energy cost savings and capital improvements 
 
translate into a positive business case with an annual ROI of 18 months or less.
