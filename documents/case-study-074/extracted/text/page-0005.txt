Improved Unit Cost with Both ECM’s
The “Unit Cost” in the HVAC industry is the kW/ton ratio. 
KW/ton is commonly used for larger commercial and 
industrial air conditioning, heat pump and refrigeration 
systems. It is the HVAC industry’s standard of 
determining how much energy is required to create a 
single ton of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you 
reduce your unit cost of cooling you are saving energy 
regardless of how much overall cooling you require.
The chart to the right clearly illustrates the amount of 
efﬁciency restoration the ECM created in the seven pilot 
systems six weeks after installation. The treated pilot 
systems are now performing 25.8% more efﬁciently than 
before being treated. This degradation in operational 
efﬁciency was costing Major Hotel Chain International a substantial 
amount of money in wasted energy.
