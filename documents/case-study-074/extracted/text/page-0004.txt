Highlights of the study
 
• The seven HVAC systems tested averaged 9 years of age.  The pilot systems produced a combined 7.22 
 
tons of cooling in the baseline and 9.04 tons following the installation of PermaFrost NMR® equating to  
 
an increase of 25.2% 
 
• The average cost to produce each ton of cooling on the pilot systems dropped 25.8% from 1.24 
 
kW/ton in the baseline to .92 kW/ton.
 
• The average Coefﬁcient of Performance (COP) of the pilot systems improved 33.8% from an average of  
 
2.99 in the baseline to 4.00.
 
• The cost to treat all seven of the pilot systems of $1,650 divided by the annual savings achieved of  
 
$3,237 results in an average payback period of 6.1 months.
ECM Product Brief
PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented surface science nanotechnology that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative 
(NMR®) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, one-time installation with no down time required, PermaFrost 
NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type of climate control system in which it is installed. The direct beneﬁts of 
PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling efﬁciency and increased capacity.
Methodology
After verifying the amount of air ﬂowing across the evaporator coils before beginning each pilot, the subsequent 
measurements used in the efﬁciency calculations were collected using AHRI Standards 210/240 and compiled in 
accordance with Option B of the IPMVP (International Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol) framework.
The results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic 
engineering formulas:
 
• kW = (Volts * Amps * Power Factor * Sq Rt of 3) /1000 (for 3-Phase)
 
• kW/ton = Actual Measured Energy / Actual Measured Capacity
 
• Coefﬁcient of Performance (COP) = 12 / (kW/ton) / 3.412
 
• Actual Cooling Capacity per Hour = (Measured CFM * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta T) / 12,000 BTU
