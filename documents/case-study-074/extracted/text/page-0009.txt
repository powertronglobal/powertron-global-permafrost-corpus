Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The following are the ﬁnal calculated average performance measurements before and after being treated with the 
PermaFrost NMR® ECM.
Average Baseline Energy Consumption
Total Baseline Capacity:  7.22 tons
Adjusted Total kW Baseline:  1.24 kW/ton * 9.04 tons = 11.21 kW
Adjusted Total Baseline kWh:  11.21 kW * 3,500 Annual Operating Hours = 39,235 kWh
Revised Total Cost to Run Baseline: 39,235 kWh * $.32 = $12,555
Average Post Energy Consumption
Total kW Post:  0.92 kW/ton * 9.04 tons = 8.32 kW
Annual Total kWh Post:  8.32 kW * 3,500 hours = 29,120 kWh
Annual Total Cost Post:  29,120 kWh * $.32 cents = $9,318
Average Savings Per Year Per Unit
Total Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year:  $12,555 - $9,318 = $3,237
Total Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $3,237 / 12 = $270
Return on Investment
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the seven pilot cooling systems: $1,650
Estimated ROI for Major Hotel Chain when treating the pilot cooling systems: $1,650 / $270 = ~6.1 months
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 196%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 981%
Explanation of Regression Analysis
Utilizing data collected during the pilot study, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback 
period for Major Hotel Chain for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to 
calculate the true energy savings resulting from the improvement in both capacity and efﬁciency. Working 
together, these improvements reduce the annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from 
determining what the cost to run the cooling systems was when operating at the original energy proﬁle to 
produce the newly restored amount of available capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the cooling 
systems at the same restored capacity after the PermaFrost NMR® was installed. This regression analysis is the 
most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or load % at which the systems 
will now operate due to the restored performance proﬁle. This restored performance proﬁle allows the cooling 
systems to satisfy the internal area set points with increased efﬁciency resulting in reduced compressor demand 
loading.
