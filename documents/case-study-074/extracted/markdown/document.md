Study Overview

This report details the results of the recently completed comprehensive energy performance study conducted on

seven small DX systems that service the three Major Hotel Chain Resort properties in Palm Beach, [Caribbean Location].

Running from August 25 to October 12, 2015, the pilot was designed to illustrate the positive impact the

PermaFrost NMR® energy control measure (ECM) would have on the overall cooling performance of common

types of cooling systems supporting the three Major Hotel Chain Resort properties. A variety of systems were tested at the

location ranging from .75 to 2 tons.

As demonstrated in this ﬁeld trial, PermaFrost NMR® restores the capacity lost over time due to fouling of the heat

exchange surfaces. This improvement in thermal performance will manifest itself in any or all of the following ways:

• Restored additional capacity produces colder, drier air to better satisfy room and suite loads

• Improved system efﬁciency, lowering cost to produce each ton of cooling required (i.e., kW/ton)

• Restored thermal efﬁciency, reducing runtime and extending useful equipment life by 15% or more

The improvements demonstrated in this or any ﬁeld test resulting from PermaFrost NMR® are dependent on

factors such as age, condition, service history, runtime of one or both compressors and the design and

application of each system. The results in this pilot were very consistent with 10-year historical performance

averages as well as the recent laboratory study completed in May, 2015 by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) in their

testing chambers in [Texas Location], TX.

Summary of Financial Beneﬁts Generated

The Major Hotel Chain Surf Club, the Major Hotel Chain Ocean Club and the Major Hotel Chain Resort will realize the following ﬁnancial beneﬁts

from investing a combined $1,650 on the installation of PermaFrost NMR® in the seven HVAC systems included in

this study:

1.    Energy Savings (annual)

2.    Avoided cost of additional capacity replacement  
 
$ 1,800

3.    Deferred capital costs

Objectives

The PermaFrost NMR® study was conducted by Energy Efﬁcient Technologies achieved four objectives:

1. Determine that the “as-is” capacity and efﬁciency of the seven pilot systems supporting the

aforementioned Major Hotel Chain Vacation facilities had substantially degraded after an average of 9 years in

operation, costing Major Hotel Chain more money in energy to run them and more money in Capital Expenditures

to replace equipment prematurely.

2. Verify that an average performance improvement of 10% or more in both tonnage and kW/ton

occurred across all seven of pilot cooling systems due to the installation of PermaFrost NMR®.  A lower

kW/ton efﬁciency ratio reduces the cost of running these climate control systems for each ton of cooling

produced.

3. Verify that every system is producing cooler, drier air as measured in both Dry Bulb and Wet Bulb

deltas following the installation of the PermaFrost NMR® technology.

4. Determine that the ﬁnancial beneﬁts associated with restored capacity and efﬁciency improvements

realized over the duration of the study in terms of energy cost savings and capital improvements

translate into a positive business case with an annual ROI of 18 months or less.

The multiple cooling systems involved in the study are recorded as follows:

Highlights of the study

• The seven HVAC systems tested averaged 9 years of age.  The pilot systems produced a combined 7.22

tons of cooling in the baseline and 9.04 tons following the installation of PermaFrost NMR® equating to

an increase of 25.2%

• The average cost to produce each ton of cooling on the pilot systems dropped 25.8% from 1.24

kW/ton in the baseline to .92 kW/ton.

• The average Coefﬁcient of Performance (COP) of the pilot systems improved 33.8% from an average of

2.99 in the baseline to 4.00.

• The cost to treat all seven of the pilot systems of $1,650 divided by the annual savings achieved of

$3,237 results in an average payback period of 6.1 months.

ECM Product Brief

PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented surface science nanotechnology that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative

(NMR®) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, one-time installation with no down time required, PermaFrost

NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type of climate control system in which it is installed. The direct beneﬁts of

PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling efﬁciency and increased capacity.

Methodology

After verifying the amount of air ﬂowing across the evaporator coils before beginning each pilot, the subsequent

measurements used in the efﬁciency calculations were collected using AHRI Standards 210/240 and compiled in

accordance with Option B of the IPMVP (International Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol) framework.

The results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic

engineering formulas:

• kW = (Volts * Amps * Power Factor * Sq Rt of 3) /1000 (for 3-Phase)

• kW/ton = Actual Measured Energy / Actual Measured Capacity

• Coefﬁcient of Performance (COP) = 12 / (kW/ton) / 3.412

• Actual Cooling Capacity per Hour = (Measured CFM * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta T) / 12,000 BTU

Improved Unit Cost with Both ECM’s

The “Unit Cost” in the HVAC industry is the kW/ton ratio.

KW/ton is commonly used for larger commercial and

industrial air conditioning, heat pump and refrigeration

systems. It is the HVAC industry’s standard of

determining how much energy is required to create a

single ton of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you

reduce your unit cost of cooling you are saving energy

regardless of how much overall cooling you require.

The chart to the right clearly illustrates the amount of

efﬁciency restoration the ECM created in the seven pilot

systems six weeks after installation. The treated pilot

systems are now performing 25.8% more efﬁciently than

before being treated. This degradation in operational

efﬁciency was costing Major Hotel Chain International a substantial

amount of money in wasted energy.

Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics

The following are the ﬁnal calculated average performance measurements before and after being treated with the

PermaFrost NMR® ECM.

Average Baseline Energy Consumption

Total Baseline Capacity:  7.22 tons

Adjusted Total kW Baseline:  1.24 kW/ton * 9.04 tons = 11.21 kW

Adjusted Total Baseline kWh:  11.21 kW * 3,500 Annual Operating Hours = 39,235 kWh

Revised Total Cost to Run Baseline: 39,235 kWh * $.32 = $12,555

Average Post Energy Consumption

Total kW Post:  0.92 kW/ton * 9.04 tons = 8.32 kW

Annual Total kWh Post:  8.32 kW * 3,500 hours = 29,120 kWh

Annual Total Cost Post:  29,120 kWh * $.32 cents = $9,318

Average Savings Per Year Per Unit

Total Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year:  $12,555 - $9,318 = $3,237

Total Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $3,237 / 12 = $270

Return on Investment

Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the seven pilot cooling systems: $1,650

Estimated ROI for Major Hotel Chain when treating the pilot cooling systems: $1,650 / $270 = ~6.1 months

Annual Internal Rate of Return = 196%

Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 981%

Explanation of Regression Analysis

Utilizing data collected during the pilot study, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback

period for Major Hotel Chain for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to

calculate the true energy savings resulting from the improvement in both capacity and efﬁciency. Working

together, these improvements reduce the annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from

determining what the cost to run the cooling systems was when operating at the original energy proﬁle to

produce the newly restored amount of available capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the cooling

systems at the same restored capacity after the PermaFrost NMR® was installed. This regression analysis is the

most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or load % at which the systems

will now operate due to the restored performance proﬁle. This restored performance proﬁle allows the cooling

systems to satisfy the internal area set points with increased efﬁciency resulting in reduced compressor demand

loading.
