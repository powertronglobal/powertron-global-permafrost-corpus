Therefore we have provided analysis of the twelve \n(12) day & nine (9) day periods to provide a performance profile of subsequent \nkW per ton, EER and COP across a variation of outdoor air temperatures \nconsisting of a thirty (30) degree span (60ºF-90ºF) to demonstrate the current \nperformance across the temperature span. \n \nThe resultant data was extracted every five (5) seconds from the specific \nparameters measured throughout the entire day.  It was then applied to industry \nbest practice engineering formulae developed by AHRI / ASHRAE (American \nHeating and Refrigeration Institute / American Society of Heating Refrigeration & \nAir Conditioning Engineers) for comparison: \n \nKilo-watt (kW) = Volts (V) x Amps (A) x Power Factor (PF) x √3 / 1000 \nBritish Thermal Units (BTU) = CFM x 4.5 x Enthalpy Delta  \nCapacity / Tons = BTU / 12,000 \nKilo-watt per Ton (kW/Ton) = kW Energy / Tons (capacity) \nCo-Efficient of Performance (COP) = 12/kW per ton/ 3.412 \nEnergy Efficiency Ratio (EER) = BTU / Watts \n \nDuring all twenty-four hours in a day, outdoor air temperature entering the air-\ncooled condenser coils of each system varies significantly. Accordingly, pre or \nbaseline and post analysis and comparison of improved capacity is across a thirty \n(30) degree temperature span (60ºF-90ºF) for kW per Ton, COP and EER. \n \n \nTo Determine Capacity: \n \nThe evaporator entering air volume and the return enthalpy are measured by the \nCFM and inlet enthalpy sensors. The evaporator leaving air enthalpy is measured \nby the outlet air enthalpy sensor. The inlet and outlet enthalpies are subtracted \nfrom each other resulting in a sum called the Enthalpy delta. This enthalpy delta \n(∆) is used in the shown formula below. Other components of this formula \ncomplete the equation. These include the volume of air passing through the \nevaporator (CFM or Cubic feet of air per minute) and an engineering standard ratio \nof 4.5 (Ratio of Standard Air) or constant.  The result of this calculation yields the \nindustry standard the British Thermal Unit (BTU), which is used to calculate the \nunit’s capacity in BTU.

Technical \n \nWhen PermaFrost NMR® is installed into a unit, a molecular transformation \ndevelops. This transformation displaces layers of lubricating fluids that have been \nimpinged in the evaporator and condenser heat exchanger surfaces. When the \nfluid is displaced, the evaporator and condenser can transfer additional heat \nenergy through the tube walls (thermal restoration). This enables the evaporator to \ncompletely dehumidify the air per the unit’s design specifications.  When more \ndehumidification is developed, the enthalpy (a measure of how many grains of \nmoisture are contained in a pound of air) increases. \n \nIf the CFM and 4.5 remain constant, then it is the effect of PermaFrost NMR®’s \nEnthalpy Delta increase that restores (increases) the lost capacity (Tons).  \n \nIf the tonnage increases, then the kW/ton decreases by means of mathematical \nfunction, demonstrating PermaFrost NMR®’s post-treatment effect lowering the \nelectrical cost of every ton of cooling produced, no matter how many tons are \ncalled for at any given time.  \n  \nPermaFrost NMR® cannot change any unit’s electrical characteristics i.e. \neverything that requires electricity is rated for the required power under different \nloads e.g. compressors and fans.  \n \n \n \n \n5.    Conclusion \n \nThe Maicom testing results validate the performance of the three (3) HVAC/R \nsystems is consistent with a previously tested UL (formerly Underwriters \nLaboratories) unit as well as +300 case studies for review.  The results of the \ntesting demonstrate the efficacy of PermaFrost NMR® by restoring the evaporator \nand condenser heat transfer capabilities per manufacturer’s design, thereby \nincreasing cooling capacity while lowering the electrical cost per ton of cooling.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \nThis document is proprietary and confidential to Powertron Global, LLC and is not to be modified, distributed all or in part to any third party \nwithout prior written approval. © Copyright 2017 Powertron Global, LLC. \n \nF. \nAPPENDIX \n \nI. \nCU-1 Performance Analysis Summary \nII. \nCU-2 Performance Analysis Summary \nIII. \nPKG-1 Performance Analysis Summary \nIV. \n35 Points Measured  \n \n*(all raw data files are available and will be provided) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \nThis document is proprietary and confidential to Powertron Global, LLC and is not to be modified, distributed all or in part to any third party \nwithout prior written approval. © Copyright 2017 Powertron Global, LLC. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \nAPPENDIX I", "tokens": 685, "chars": 2992, "pages": {"start": 5, "end": 8}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_008_chunk_0004", "next_id": "pdf_008_chunk_0006", "content_hash": "sha256:f44f7cfd4e4ea66d757314bd95f505738cfce31c2471f441c9955755f5bdfc9d"}
