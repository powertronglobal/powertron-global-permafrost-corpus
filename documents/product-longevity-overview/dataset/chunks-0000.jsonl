The nanotechnology chemical process affects two \nstages of the metal surfaces. First, charged molecules dislodge larger \nmolecular debris that have attached to metal imperfections and substrata. It is \nthis layer of debris that frustrates thermal transfer. The charged particles then \nbind with the metal surface, imperfections, and metal substrata to create a \npermanent barrier against problem reoccurrence. This barrier becomes a part \nof the machine and can only be removed by acid.  \n \nIn the rare instance where acid occurs by malfunction or is introduced to a \nsystem that has been treated with an acid flush, Powertron will retreat the \nunit free of charge. \n \nPermanency can only be substantiated through testing over time and use. \nPermaFrost NMR® has been in service across the world for more than 15 \nyears. Major customers like Major Global Bank A, which has deployed at over 10,000 \nlocations in the past decade, wanted proof of lasting protection. Six years after \ndeployment, Major Global Bank A requested a verification of treated machines (link \nhere). In all instances, machines remained near, at or in some cases above, \nlisted OEM design specified cooling capacity. \n \nAccess to reports is included below. \n \nLongevity Studies \n• Major Global Bank A (link) \n• Restaurant Chain A (link) \n• QSR Chain A’s (link)", "tokens": 344, "chars": 1543, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 1}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "", "content_hash": "sha256:0254962c6af137716f40e0953380f36b92c79654fed5890046019cd4f5897d39"}
