Proof: Product Longevity 
 
 
Summary 
 
PermaFrost NMR® is a one-time treatment that permanently resolves the 
problem of oil migration. The nanotechnology chemical process affects two 
stages of the metal surfaces. First, charged molecules dislodge larger 
molecular debris that have attached to metal imperfections and substrata. It is 
this layer of debris that frustrates thermal transfer. The charged particles then 
bind with the metal surface, imperfections, and metal substrata to create a 
permanent barrier against problem reoccurrence. This barrier becomes a part 
of the machine and can only be removed by acid.  
 
In the rare instance where acid occurs by malfunction or is introduced to a 
system that has been treated with an acid flush, Powertron will retreat the 
unit free of charge. 
 
Permanency can only be substantiated through testing over time and use. 
PermaFrost NMR® has been in service across the world for more than 15 
years. Major customers like Major Global Bank A, which has deployed at over 10,000 
locations in the past decade, wanted proof of lasting protection. Six years after 
deployment, Major Global Bank A requested a verification of treated machines (link 
here). In all instances, machines remained near, at or in some cases above, 
listed OEM design specified cooling capacity.
