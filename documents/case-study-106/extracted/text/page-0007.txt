Methodology
After verifying the amount of air flowing across the evaporator coils before beginning each pilot, the 
subsequent measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected using AHRI Standards 210/240
& 340/360 and compiled in accordance with Option B of the IPMVP (International Measurement and 
Verification Protocol) framework.   
The results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic 
engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• kW/ton = Actual Measured Energy / Actual Measured Capacity 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = 12 / (kW/ton) /3.412
 
• Actual Cooling Capacity per Hour = (Measured CFM * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta T) / 12,000 BTU
Recovered Unit Cost with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
The kW/ton is the standard Unit Cost in the HVAC 
industry. It is the HVAC industry’s standard of 
determining how much energy is required to create 1 ton 
of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you reduce your 
unit cost of cooling you are saving regardless of how 
much cooling is required.
The chart to the right illustrates the amount of efficiency 
restoration the ECM created in the pilot systems after 
installation. This degradation in operational efficiency is 
costing Major North American Bank a substantial amount of money in 
wasted energy.  As the last chart clearly illustrates, the 
pilot systems are currently performing 21% more 
efficiently than the control systems. This gap will only 
continue to widen until it levels off at 30-35% loss of 
efficiency.
