Energy Consumption & Financial Detail
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® 
Post measurement period for the pilot systems compared to the control system.
Avg. Baseline Energy Consumption
Avg. Baseline Capacity:  7.51 tons
Avg. Adjusted kW Baseline:  1.16 kW/ton * 9.16 tons = 10.63 kW
Avg. Adjusted Baseline kWh:  10.63 kW * 2,990 Annual Operating Hrs = 31,784 kWh
Avg. Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 31,784 kWh * $.17 = $5,403
Avg. Post Energy Consumption
kW Post:  .933 kW/ton * 9.16 tons = 8.545 kW
Annual kWh Post:  8.545 kW * 2,990 hours = 25,550 kWh
Annual Cost Post:  25,550 kWh * $.17 cents = $4,344
Avg. Savings per Year Per System
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year:  $5,403 - $4,344 = $1,059
Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $1,059 / 12 = $88
Estimated Energy savings per year for all four pilot systems = $4,236
Payback Period
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in all four pilot cooling systems: $3,875
Estimated Payback Period for Major North American Bank when treating all four pilot cooling systems: $3,875 / $352 = 11 Months
Return on Investment
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 109%
Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 547%
Explanation of Regression Analysis
Utilizing data collected during the pilot study, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for TD 
Bank for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in both capacity and efficiency. Working together, these improvements reduce the 
annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the cooling systems 
was when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available capacity and then 
subtracting the revised cost to run the systems at the same restored capacity after the PermaFrostNMR® ECM was installed. 
This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or load % at 
which the systems will now operate due to the restored performance profile. This restored performance profile allows the 
cooling systems to satisfy the internal area set point with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
