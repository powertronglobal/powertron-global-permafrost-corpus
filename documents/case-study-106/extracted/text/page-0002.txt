The in-situ testing of PermaFrost NMR in two unitary systems occurred at 
two locations in Brooklyn, NY. The addresses are 987 4th Avenue & 9904 
4th Avenue. The instrumentation utilized during the baseline and the post 
data gathering period were identical. The methods to employ these 
instruments were identical as well. Current instrument validation of 
calibration and accuracy were furnished to Underwriters Laboratories (UL) 
to assure compliance with accepted standards. 
 
On August 10, 2015 during the baseline measurements, UL’s Senior Field 
Engineer [UL Field Engineer] witnessed and verified all readings performed by 
Powertron Global’s Senior Engineer [Senior Energy Engineer]. On September 3, 
2015 the team returned to these same two locations and performed the 
post measurements with UL’s Engineering technician [UL Engineering Technician] 
verifying all data collection.  
 
After all data was received, field data sheets were completed by 
requesting the data that was sent to the mobile devices of the U.L. 
representatives to be read aloud to the field engineer performing the test 
and that the data read from their devices was transferred in writing to the 
field sheet. The U.L. representatives were asked to sign and date these 
sheets and photograph the results. 
 
The following categories were measured and witnessed by the UL 
representatives:  
 
- System air volume (CFM) 
- Return and supply air dry and wet bulb temperature (measured across
