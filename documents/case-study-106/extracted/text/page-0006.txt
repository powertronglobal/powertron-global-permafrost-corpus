Objectives
The PermaFrost NMR® study was jointly-conducted by Major North American Bank, Property Management Firm B, Underwriters Laboratories (UL), 
HVAC Contractor A and Powertron Global and achieved four objectives: 
 
1. Determine that the “as-is” capacity and efficiency of the four pilot systems supporting the 
 
   aforementioned Major North American Bank facilities had degraded by at least 10% after an average of 9 years in 
 
   operation.  
 
2. Verify that an average of 10% performance improvement in both tonnage and kW/ton occurred  
 
    across all four of pilot cooling systems due to the installation of PermaFrost NMR®. A lower kW/ton 
 
    efficiency ratio reduces the unit cost of running climate control systems.
 
3. Verify that every system is producing cooler, drier air as measured in both Dry Bulb and Wet Bulb 
 
    deltas due to the installation of  PermaFrost NMR®.
 
4. Report the financial benefits associated with efficiency improvements realized over the duration of 
 
    the study in terms of energy cost savings and capital improvements of restored capacity.. 
 
    The financial benefits support an effective business case for Major North American Bank portfolio of properties to reduce 
 
    its unit cost for cooling providing a 24-month or less payback to Major North American Bank.
The multiple cooling systems involved in the study are recorded as follows:

ECM Product Brief
PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented surface science nanotechnology that uses Nucleo Molecular 
Regenerative (NMR®) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, one-time installation with no down time 
required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type of climate control system in which it is 
installed.  The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling efficiency and increased capacity.
