They are as follows:\n \n \n• 987 4th Avenue, Brooklyn, NY \n \n• 9904 4th Avenue, Brooklyn, NY\n \n• 16406 Union Turnpike, Queens, NY \n         \n• [Queens Laboratory Address], Queens, NY\nRunning from August 10 to September 4, 2015, the pilot was designed to illustrate the positive impact the \nPermaFrost NMR® energy control measure (ECM) would have on the overall cooling performance of common \ntypes of cooling systems supporting the Major North American Bank portfolio of facilities. A variety of package rooftop units were \ntested at three of the locations, while a common split system was tested at the fourth location.\nAs demonstrated in this field trial, PermaFrost NMR® restores the capacity lost over time due to fouling of the \nheat exchange surfaces. This improvement in thermal performance will manifest itself in any or all of the \nfollowing ways:\n \n• Restored additional capacity to better satisfy fluctuating building loads \n \n• Additional critical HVAC redundancy at no extra cost or interruption to facility operations\n \n• Improved system efficiency, lowering cost to produce each ton of cooling required (i.e., kW/ton)\n \n• Restored thermal efficiency allowing systems to achieve thermostat set points faster, reducing \n \n   runtime (i.e., kWh) and extending useful equipment life an average of 15% \nThe improvements demonstrated in this or any field test resulting from PermaFrost NMR® are dependent on \nfactors such as age, condition, service history, runtime of one or both compressors and the design and application \nof each system. The results in this pilot were very consistent with 13 year historical performance averages as well \nas the recent laboratory study completed in May, 2015 by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) in their testing \nchambers in [Texas Location], TX.", "tokens": 810, "chars": 3588, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_101_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_101_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:11b95b414eb4560fae14f66d6bcc5316e54318bcbb4957914f0b0dd588694833"}

Return On Investment (5 years) \n \n \n \n \n547%\nHighlights of the study:\n• The four HVAC systems tested ranged in age from 7 to 12 years respectively with the average age \n    being 9 years in service. The pilot systems  produced a combined 30.02 ton of cooling. After the \n    installation of Permafrost NMR® 22%  of the cooling capacity was restored (36.63 tons post vs 30.02 \n    ton baseline).\n• The average cost to produce each ton of cooling on the pilot systems dropped 21% from 1.43 kW/ton \n    in the baseline to 1.13 kW/ton. \n• The average Coefficient of Performance (COP) of the pilot systems improved 23.7% from an average \n    of 2.91 in the baseline to 3.60. \n• The average cost to operate each system at an average of $.17 per kWh delivered fell 19.6% from \n    $5,403 in the baseline to $4,344.\n• The cost to treat all four of the pilot systems of $3,875 divided by the annual savings achieved of \n    $4,236 results in an average payback period of 11 months. \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 624, "chars": 2526, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_101_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_101_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:d5b890fc3c213ecea0dcfaa2aba9dc3f9a301b195c9986466575861e891e70f9"}

Determine that the “as-is” capacity and efficiency of the four pilot systems supporting the \n \n   aforementioned Major North American Bank facilities had degraded by at least 10% after an average of 9 years in \n \n   operation.  \n \n2. Verify that an average of 10% performance improvement in both tonnage and kW/ton occurred  \n \n    across all four of pilot cooling systems due to the installation of PermaFrost NMR®. A lower kW/ton \n \n    efficiency ratio reduces the unit cost of running climate control systems.\n \n3. Verify that every system is producing cooler, drier air as measured in both Dry Bulb and Wet Bulb \n \n    deltas due to the installation of  PermaFrost NMR®.\n \n4. Report the financial benefits associated with efficiency improvements realized over the duration of \n \n    the study in terms of energy cost savings and capital improvements of restored capacity.. \n \n    The financial benefits support an effective business case for Major North American Bank portfolio of properties to reduce \n \n    its unit cost for cooling providing a 24-month or less payback to Major North American Bank.\nThe multiple cooling systems involved in the study are recorded as follows:\nCarrier, Mfg date: 2006, R22, 208 volt-3 Phase, Model 48HJF009 (987 4th Ave, Brooklyn)\nCarrier, Mfg date: 2008, R22, 208 volt-3 Phase, Model 48HJF012 (9904 4th Ave, Brooklyn)\nCarrier, Mfg date: 2006, R22, 208 volt-3 Phase, Model 48HJF008 (16406 Union Tnpk, Queens)\nCarrier, Mfg date: 2003, R22, 208 volt-3 Phase, Model 38TRA048 ([Queens Laboratory Address], Queens)\nECM Product Brief\nPermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented surface science nanotechnology that uses Nucleo Molecular \nRegenerative (NMR®) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, one-time installation with no down time \nrequired, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type of climate control system in which it is \ninstalled.  The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling efficiency and increased capacity. \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 660, "chars": 2774, "pages": {"start": 5, "end": 6}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_101_chunk_0003", "next_id": "pdf_101_chunk_0005", "content_hash": "sha256:fbadc092871e9c66dc5e223995f5cd49b2ee703570a323c4ac7aee118108143b"}

It is the HVAC industry’s standard of \ndetermining how much energy is required to create 1 ton \nof cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you reduce your \nunit cost of cooling you are saving regardless of how \nmuch cooling is required.\nThe chart to the right illustrates the amount of efficiency \nrestoration the ECM created in the pilot systems after \ninstallation. This degradation in operational efficiency is \ncosting Major North American Bank a substantial amount of money in \nwasted energy.  As the last chart clearly illustrates, the \npilot systems are currently performing 21% more \nefficiently than the control systems. This gap will only \ncontinue to widen until it levels off at 30-35% loss of \nefficiency.\nkW/ton\n.30 kW/ton\nRecovered\nEnergy\nEquating to a\n21% Reduction\nPilot Systems Performance Eﬃciency\nAfter Installation\nBaseline\nPost ECM\n1.43\n1.13\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 573, "chars": 2363, "pages": {"start": 6, "end": 7}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_101_chunk_0004", "next_id": "pdf_101_chunk_0006", "content_hash": "sha256:037e24faea8703818438c9aa89e9cbcc695aa4c440ddaded9f4037ade9438fde"}

Working together, these improvements reduce the \nannual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the cooling systems \nwas when operating at the original energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available capacity and then \nsubtracting the revised cost to run the systems at the same restored capacity after the PermaFrostNMR® ECM was installed. \nThis regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or load % at \nwhich the systems will now operate due to the restored performance profile. This restored performance profile allows the \ncooling systems to satisfy the internal area set point with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.\n    7\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 688, "chars": 2908, "pages": {"start": 9, "end": 10}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_101_chunk_0007", "next_id": "pdf_101_chunk_0009", "content_hash": "sha256:c6db31f0f7ab26933f8d8f23dfda68a58dc750ca6e3e1cb01a58c3b0f7c53b94"}

These are instantaneous benefits realized at installation.\nTreating the 4 HVAC systems with PermaFrost NMR® allows Major North American Bank to realize the following \nﬁnancial beneﬁts: \n \n1. Restoration of 6 tons of HVAC Capacity. (Current rate to purchase commercial rooftop HVAC \n \n    capacity is ~ $1000 per ton installed). \n \n2. Deferred Capital Cost. (Extending the remaining useful life of HVAC equipment will defer capital \n \n    cost of replacement. Using five years (30%) service life remaining, the systems will experience an \n \n    estimated 1-1.5 years of additional service life, deferring replacement costs by 20%). \n \n3. Capital Improvement Deduction. (Improving performance and extending the useful life of existing \n \n    equipment allows for a capital expense classification. This classification enhances EBITDA, reduces \n \n    exposure, and preserves asset value while deducting the expense over the remaining life of the system \n \n    ~ 5 years). \n    8\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website.  \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\n12.7\nPassenger vehicles\n3.1\nGarbage trucks of waste sent to\nthe landﬁll instead of recycled\n6,772\nGallons of gasoline\nconsumed\n64,642\nPounds of coal burned\nannually\n140\nBarrels of oil\nconsumed\n8.3\nHomes’ electricity use for\none year\n    9\nMajor North American Bank is Saving More than Just Energy and\nPreserving Capital\nBy treating the pilot cooling systems plus all the other equipment at the four locations with PermaFrost \nNMR®, based on the manner in which the systems are currently being operated, Major North American Bank will save \napproximately 87,276 kWh per year and all the costs associated with those savings.
