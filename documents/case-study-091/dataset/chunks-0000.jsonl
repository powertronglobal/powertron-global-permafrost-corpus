The chiller selected represent and to document the future avoided energy costs \nassociated with the same. The chillers selected represent a microcosm of the overall Data Center Provider portfolio of chiller \nequipment. This allows the average savings percentage achieved and the future avoided energy costs calculated \nto be easily extrapolated out five and 10 years into the future to determine the viability of the business case.  \nUnderstanding the Opportunity for Efficiency Restoration\nAll Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (HVACR) systems experience thermal\ndegradation over time. Internal surfaces of heat exchangers lose their optimal thermal transfer\ncharacteristics, resulting in reduced capacity, lower efficiency, and higher operating costs. This\ndegradation affects superheat levels and overall system performance, impacting the useful\nequipment life of the HVACR system.\nRestoring System Efficiency with PermaFrost NMR\nPermaFrost NMR® technology addresses this thermal degradation by creating a permanent thermal\nmetal coating on the tube walls, whether on the inside or outside surfaces depending on the HVACR\nequipment. This coating conditions the metal surfaces, reducing friction and restoring the system's\noriginal thermal transfer efficiency. In every application this results in a lower per unit cost of cooling\nwhich ultimately translates into lower overall energy costs. \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 628, "chars": 3052, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_090_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:77d66843110e4d642c76b8a038935f3af03b09a5ce0d0126ca75d3bf68b14977"}

The cooling capacity the Chillers are capable of producing after 6+ years in service. \n \n2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the Chillers are delivering \n \n    as reflected in the kW/ton measurement. \n \n3. The thermal dynamic ability of the Chillers to still perform at or close to operational design.\nThe measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the \nIPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) testing framework. \nDue to operational constraints relating to ongoing construction schedules in the chiller plant, the testing at \n[Southeast Location] Metro was started on 20 November 2013 and concluded on 4 December 2013. This gave the ECM just \nover 330 hours to gestate within the chiller and improve thermal performance. The ECM normally produces \n90% or more of the improvement benefits it will ultimately deliver at 400+ runtime hours.\nThe testing at Santa Clara II was started on 23 January 2014 and concluded on 26 February 2014. This allowed \nthe ECM just over 600 hours to gestate within the chiller and improve thermal performance.\nNotes\nThe boundary of the testing was the Chillers themselves, flange to flange while matching the baseline and post water \ntemperatures entering the condenser and the returning chilled water temperatures entering the evaporator; therefore \nconfidence in the accuracy of the performance calculations is very high.

The average cost to operate this \nunit before it was treated with PermaFrost NMR®, \nas calculated in kW/ton, was 0.49.\nThe specific cost to operate this unit after it was \ntreated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in \nkW/ton, is currently 0.44.\nThe higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of \nperformance efficiency and cost to operate estimate for a 6 year old chiller unit. The post results are also in \nline with the average improvement savings shown over more than 130,000 installations globally.\nAdditional Key Results for [Southeast Location] Metro Chiller \nCost to Operate\nkW/ton\n0.05 kW/ton\nBaseline\nPost ECM\n0.49\n0.44\n944,385\nPOST\nBASELINE\n847,815\nAnnual kWh\nREDUCTION\n10.2%\n8.7%\nPOST\nBASELINE\nChilled Water Delta \nIMPROVEMENT\n10.3° F\n11.2° F\nHVAC Equipment Manufacturer\nCVHF570\nR123\n490\n4,350\n2007\nSystem Description\nManufacturer\nModel Number\nRefrigerant Type\nNominal Cooling Capacity in\nTons at Given Test conditions  \nAverage Annual\nRuntime Hours\nDate Installed\nNotes\nThe pilot Chiller unit provides cooling to the main data center \nfloor at the Data Center Provider Santa Clara II complex. Although there is a \nconsistently heavy load, the complex has a redundant chiller to \nhandle the load in this particular facility for half of the time at \na minimum. Given this operational scenario, Data Center Provider plant \npersonnel determined the pilot chiller unit runs approximately \n4,350 hours or more annually prior to the ECM being \nimplemented. To be conservative, we used the minimum \nnumber of hours to develop the Initial Payback Period (IPP) \nand Internal Rate of Return (IRR).\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 632, "chars": 2519, "pages": {"start": 12, "end": 13}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_090_chunk_0008", "next_id": "pdf_090_chunk_0010", "content_hash": "sha256:32a38393a06dd47d3be4bea7aa0d20cb7cb2e91ba00597f234956688877c1f51"}

This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post \nAnalysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems was when operating at the original energy \nprofile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the \nsystems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the \nmost widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the systems will now operate due to the \nrestored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the internal building set points with increased \nefficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.\n13\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 630, "chars": 2635, "pages": {"start": 13, "end": 14}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_090_chunk_0009", "next_id": "", "content_hash": "sha256:7c656e47e8ca69ae2903b4de902ceec06187c3943b1e2457e2a81daf7bc5aac8"}
