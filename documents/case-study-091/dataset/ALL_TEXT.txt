HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report
Purpose of the Study
This comprehensive efficiency study was conducted in an effort to verify the effectiveness of the PermaFrost 
NMR®  Energy Conservation Measure (ECM) in two large, mission critical centrifugal chillers located on 
opposite sides of the country. The chiller selected represent and to document the future avoided energy costs 
associated with the same. The chillers selected represent a microcosm of the overall Data Center Provider portfolio of chiller 
equipment. This allows the average savings percentage achieved and the future avoided energy costs calculated 
to be easily extrapolated out five and 10 years into the future to determine the viability of the business case.  
Understanding the Opportunity for Efficiency Restoration
All Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (HVACR) systems experience thermal
degradation over time. Internal surfaces of heat exchangers lose their optimal thermal transfer
characteristics, resulting in reduced capacity, lower efficiency, and higher operating costs. This
degradation affects superheat levels and overall system performance, impacting the useful
equipment life of the HVACR system.
Restoring System Efficiency with PermaFrost NMR
PermaFrost NMR® technology addresses this thermal degradation by creating a permanent thermal
metal coating on the tube walls, whether on the inside or outside surfaces depending on the HVACR
equipment. This coating conditions the metal surfaces, reducing friction and restoring the system's
original thermal transfer efficiency. In every application this results in a lower per unit cost of cooling
which ultimately translates into lower overall energy costs.

Summary Results of the Data Center Provider Study
This report contains specific information regarding the performance profiles of two large chillers; the first is 
housed at the Data Center Provider [Southeast Location] Metro facility and the second at the Data Center Provider Santa Clara II facility. At the conclusion of 
the pilot, the two chillers displayed the substantial changes listed below. 
Of note, the improvements produced in the pilot chillers and illustrated in the remainder of this report 
resulted in Data Center Provider implementing the PermaFrost NMR® technology in their entire portfolio data centers 
across the country.  This totals more than 15 million square feet of operational raised floor space and nearly 
50,000 tons of cooling.
[Southeast Location] Metro Chiller  
 
• Annual kWh consumed based on avg kW/ton fell by 339,750 from 3,821,750 to 3,482,000 or 8.9%
 
• Overall capacity rose by 272 tons from 3,125 tons to 3,397 tons or 8.7%
 
• Average cost per unit of cooling (i.e., kW/ton) fell by .04 from 0.45 to 0.41 or 8.9%
 
• Energy costs to operate the chiller fell by $20,385 from $229,305 to $208,920 or 8.9% 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) increased by 0.72 from 7.85 to 8.57 or 9.2%
The efficiency improvements demonstrated in the [Southeast Location] Metro chiller equate to an Initial Payback Period 
(IPP) of 14.6 months and a corresponding Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 82.3%.
Santa Clara II Chiller  
 
• Annual kWh consumed fell by 94,395 from 944,385 to 847,815 or 10.2% 
 
• Overall capacity rose by 35 tons from 408 tons to 443 tons or 8.7%
 
• Average cost per unit of cooling (i.e., kW/ton) fell by .05 from 0.49 to 0.44 or 10.2%
 
• Energy costs to operate the chiller fell by $10,622 from $103,882 to $93,260 or 10.2% 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) increased by .83 from 7.15 to 7.98 or 11.6%
The efficiency improvements demonstrated in the Santa Clara II chiller equate to an Initial Payback Period 
(IPP) of 14.4 months and a corresponding Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 83.2%. 
Further details of both sets of the measurements are described in separate sections later in this report. All 
testing was directed by [Client Representative], P.E., CSSGB, Director Mission Critical Facilities for Data Center Provider. All 
measurements were taken and recorded by Gibbens Drake Scott Engineering, an independent 3rd party 
testing firm hired by Data Center Provider. [Senior Energy Engineer], Director of Engineering for Powertron Global witnessed all of 
the measurements.

Methodology
Detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on the pilot Chillers before and 
after the installation of the ECM to determine the impact on the three key elements as they relate to the 
original design specifications that greatly affect the power bills:
 
 
1. The cooling capacity the Chillers are capable of producing after 6+ years in service. 
 
2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the Chillers are delivering 
 
    as reflected in the kW/ton measurement. 
 
3. The thermal dynamic ability of the Chillers to still perform at or close to operational design.
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the 
IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) testing framework. 
Due to operational constraints relating to ongoing construction schedules in the chiller plant, the testing at 
[Southeast Location] Metro was started on 20 November 2013 and concluded on 4 December 2013. This gave the ECM just 
over 330 hours to gestate within the chiller and improve thermal performance. The ECM normally produces 
90% or more of the improvement benefits it will ultimately deliver at 400+ runtime hours.
The testing at Santa Clara II was started on 23 January 2014 and concluded on 26 February 2014. This allowed 
the ECM just over 600 hours to gestate within the chiller and improve thermal performance.
Notes
The boundary of the testing was the Chillers themselves, flange to flange while matching the baseline and post water 
temperatures entering the condenser and the returning chilled water temperatures entering the evaporator; therefore 
confidence in the accuracy of the performance calculations is very high. Very similar flow rates were used in both testing 
periods.

Formulas Used for Performance Calculations
This report will illustrate the thermal degradation that has occurred in heat exchangers over time
and how much of that has been restored after the ECM's introduction.
 
Results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
• kW = (Volts * Amps * 1.47) /1000 
 
• Cooling Tons = (GPM * 8.34 * 60 * CHW delta) / 12,000 
 
• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage Measured
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton) / 3.412
 
• Refrigerant Approach = CHW Leaving Temp – Refrigerant Suction Temp 
Notes
The boundary of the testing was the Chillers themselves, flange to flange while matching the baseline and post water 
temperatures entering the condenser and the returning chilled water temperatures entering the evaporator; therefore 
confidence in the accuracy of the performance calculations is very high. Very similar flow rates were used in both testing 
periods.

By Implementing PermaFrost NMR Data Center Provider is Saving More
than Just Energy
By treating just the two pilot chillers with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the current manner Data Center Provider operates 
this equipment, it will save approximately 436,320 kWh per year and all the costs associated with those 
savings. From an environmental impact standpoint, Data Center Provider is also benefitting the surrounding communities of 
[Southeast Location] and Santa Clara, CA. Imagine how great the environmental impact will be when Data Center Provider 
completes the treatment of all their climate control systems across the USA by the end of 2014.
The 436,320 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 301 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from 
being released or any of the following:

Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Chiller Unit Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Like every other business, Data Center Provider has the problem of thermal degradation in its chillers. The lower operating 
tonnage and COP ratings measured in-situ are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to 
operate numbers in chillers of this age and usage profile. The degraded equipment performance is costing Data Center Provider 
significant money and wasting energy – and the problem was only going to get worse. Starting the pilot, the 
chiller is consuming significantly more kWh to operate than it did when it was new. 
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the chiller unit in the baseline and 
post testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. 
The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 272 operating tons and an average 
improvement of 9.2% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the chiller 
unit throughout the year.
The HVAC Equipment Manufacturer chiller unit treated has a nominal capacity of 3,450 tons when operating at the conditions in both the 
baseline and post. During the recording periods the chiller was operating at 97% load.  Since normal operations 
were not to be changed to accommodate the pilot, the emphasis here is on the delta between baseline and post.

Reducing the Cost for Every Ton of Cooling Consumed
The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration the PermaFrost NMR® ECM created in 
the treated Chiller unit. The average cost to operate 
this unit before it was treated with PermaFrost 
NMR®, as calculated in kW/ton, was 0.45.
The specific cost to operate this unit after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, is currently 0.41.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate for a 5 ½ year old Chiller unit. The post results are also 
in line with the average improvement savings shown over more than 130,000 installations globally.

Notes
The pilot Chiller unit provides cooling to the main data center 
floor at the Data Center Provider [Southeast Location] metro complex. Although there is a 
consistently heavy load, the complex utilizes outside air at 
times through plate & frame heat exchangers in addition to 
having five other similar sized chiller units available to 
support all the cooling duties. Given this operational scenario, 
Data Center Provider plant personnel determined the pilot chiller unit runs 
approximately 2,500 hours or more annually prior to the ECM 
being implemented. To be conservative, we used the minimum 
number of hours to develop the Initial Payback Period (IPP) 
and Internal Rate of Return (IRR).

Sustainable Financial Beneﬁts
The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR®  
Post measurement period for the Data Center Provider – [Southeast Location] Metro Chiller Unit.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 3125 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: 0.45 kW/ton * 3,397 tons = 1,528.7 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 1,528.7 kW * 2,500 Annual Operating Hrs = 3,821,750 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 3,821,750 kWh * $.06 = $229,305
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: 0.41 kW/ton * 3,397 tons = 1,392.8 kW
Annual kWh Post: 1,392.8 kW * 2,500 hours = 3,482,000 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 3,482,000 kWh * .06 cents = $208,920
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $229,305 - $208,920 = $20,385
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $20,385 / 12 = $1,699
Initial Payback Period (IPP)
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot Chiller unit: $24,768
Estimated Initial Payback Period (IPP) for Pilot Chiller: $24,768 / $1,699 = 14.6 months
Estimated Annual Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for Pilot Chiller: 82.3%
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for 
Data Center Provider for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post 
Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems was when operating at the original energy 
profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the 
systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the 
most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the systems will now operate due to the 
restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the internal building set points with increased 
efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.

handle the load in this particular facility for half of the time at 
a minimum. Given this operational scenario, Data Center Provider plant 
personnel determined the pilot chiller unit runs approximately 
4,350 hours or more annually prior to the ECM being
