Reducing the Cost for Every Ton of Cooling Consumed
The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration the PermaFrost NMR® ECM created in 
the treated Chiller unit. The average cost to operate 
this unit before it was treated with PermaFrost 
NMR®, as calculated in kW/ton, was 0.45.
The specific cost to operate this unit after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, is currently 0.41.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate for a 5 ½ year old Chiller unit. The post results are also 
in line with the average improvement savings shown over more than 130,000 installations globally.

Notes
The pilot Chiller unit provides cooling to the main data center 
floor at the Data Center Provider [Southeast Location] metro complex. Although there is a 
consistently heavy load, the complex utilizes outside air at 
times through plate & frame heat exchangers in addition to 
having five other similar sized chiller units available to 
support all the cooling duties. Given this operational scenario, 
Data Center Provider plant personnel determined the pilot chiller unit runs 
approximately 2,500 hours or more annually prior to the ECM 
being implemented. To be conservative, we used the minimum 
number of hours to develop the Initial Payback Period (IPP) 
and Internal Rate of Return (IRR).
