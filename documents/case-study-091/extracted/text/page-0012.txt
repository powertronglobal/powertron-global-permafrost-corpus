Summary of HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Chiller Unit Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
Like every other business, Data Center Provider has the problem of thermal degradation in its chillers. The lower operating 
tonnage and COP ratings measured in-situ are in line with the ASHRAE loss of performance and cost to 
operate numbers in chillers of this age and usage profile. The degraded equipment performance is costing Data Center Provider 
significant money and wasting energy – and the problem was only going to get worse. Starting the pilot, the 
chiller is consuming significantly more kWh to operate than it did when it was new. 
The performance summary includes the measured efficiency and tonnage of the chiller unit in the baseline and 
post testing periods demonstrating the impact of thermal degradation. 
The implementation of PermaFrost NMR® ECM resulted in a restoration of 35 operating tons and an average 
improvement of 11.6% in Coefficient of Performance (COP), significantly reducing the cost to operate the chiller 
unit throughout the year.
The HVAC Equipment Manufacturer chiller unit treated has a nominal capacity of 490 tons when operating at the conditions in both the 
baseline and post. During the recording periods the chiller was operating at 89% load.  Since normal operations 
were not to be changed to accommodate the pilot, the emphasis here is on the delta between baseline and post.
