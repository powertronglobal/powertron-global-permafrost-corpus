By Implementing PermaFrost NMR Data Center Provider is Saving More
than Just Energy
By treating just the two pilot chillers with PermaFrost NMR®, based on the current manner Data Center Provider operates 
this equipment, it will save approximately 436,320 kWh per year and all the costs associated with those

The 436,320 kWh saved per year equates to preventing 301 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from 
being released or any of the following:
