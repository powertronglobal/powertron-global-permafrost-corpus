Reducing the Cost for Every Ton of Cooling Consumed
The chart to the right illustrates the performance 
restoration the PermaFrost NMR® created in the 
treated Chiller unit. The average cost to operate this 
unit before it was treated with PermaFrost NMR®, 
as calculated in kW/ton, was 0.49.
The specific cost to operate this unit after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, is currently 0.44.
The higher baseline kW/ton rating measured in-situ was expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimate for a 6 year old chiller unit. The post results are also in 
line with the average improvement savings shown over more than 130,000 installations globally.

Notes
The pilot Chiller unit provides cooling to the main data center 
floor at the Data Center Provider Santa Clara II complex. Although there is a 
consistently heavy load, the complex has a redundant chiller to 
handle the load in this particular facility for half of the time at 
a minimum. Given this operational scenario, Data Center Provider plant 
personnel determined the pilot chiller unit runs approximately 
4,350 hours or more annually prior to the ECM being 
implemented. To be conservative, we used the minimum 
number of hours to develop the Initial Payback Period (IPP) 
and Internal Rate of Return (IRR).
