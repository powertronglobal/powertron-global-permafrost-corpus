Formulas Used for Performance Calculations
This report will illustrate the thermal degradation that has occurred in heat exchangers over time
and how much of that has been restored after the ECM's introduction.
 
Results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
• kW = (Volts * Amps * 1.47) /1000 
 
• Cooling Tons = (GPM * 8.34 * 60 * CHW delta) / 12,000 
 
• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage Measured
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton) / 3.412
 
• Refrigerant Approach = CHW Leaving Temp – Refrigerant Suction Temp 
Notes
The boundary of the testing was the Chillers themselves, flange to flange while matching the baseline and post water 
temperatures entering the condenser and the returning chilled water temperatures entering the evaporator; therefore 
confidence in the accuracy of the performance calculations is very high. Very similar flow rates were used in both testing 
periods.
