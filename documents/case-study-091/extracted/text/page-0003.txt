Summary Results of the Data Center Provider Study
This report contains specific information regarding the performance profiles of two large chillers; the first is 
housed at the Data Center Provider [Southeast Location] Metro facility and the second at the Data Center Provider Santa Clara II facility. At the conclusion of 
the pilot, the two chillers displayed the substantial changes listed below. 
Of note, the improvements produced in the pilot chillers and illustrated in the remainder of this report 
resulted in Data Center Provider implementing the PermaFrost NMR® technology in their entire portfolio data centers 
across the country.  This totals more than 15 million square feet of operational raised floor space and nearly 
50,000 tons of cooling.
[Southeast Location] Metro Chiller  
 
• Annual kWh consumed based on avg kW/ton fell by 339,750 from 3,821,750 to 3,482,000 or 8.9%
 
• Overall capacity rose by 272 tons from 3,125 tons to 3,397 tons or 8.7%
 
• Average cost per unit of cooling (i.e., kW/ton) fell by .04 from 0.45 to 0.41 or 8.9%
 
• Energy costs to operate the chiller fell by $20,385 from $229,305 to $208,920 or 8.9% 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) increased by 0.72 from 7.85 to 8.57 or 9.2%
The efficiency improvements demonstrated in the [Southeast Location] Metro chiller equate to an Initial Payback Period 
(IPP) of 14.6 months and a corresponding Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 82.3%.
Santa Clara II Chiller  
 
• Annual kWh consumed fell by 94,395 from 944,385 to 847,815 or 10.2% 
 
• Overall capacity rose by 35 tons from 408 tons to 443 tons or 8.7%
 
• Average cost per unit of cooling (i.e., kW/ton) fell by .05 from 0.49 to 0.44 or 10.2%
 
• Energy costs to operate the chiller fell by $10,622 from $103,882 to $93,260 or 10.2% 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) increased by .83 from 7.15 to 7.98 or 11.6%
The efficiency improvements demonstrated in the Santa Clara II chiller equate to an Initial Payback Period 
(IPP) of 14.4 months and a corresponding Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 83.2%. 
Further details of both sets of the measurements are described in separate sections later in this report. All 
testing was directed by [Client Representative], P.E., CSSGB, Director Mission Critical Facilities for Data Center Provider. All 
measurements were taken and recorded by Gibbens Drake Scott Engineering, an independent 3rd party 
testing firm hired by Data Center Provider. [Senior Energy Engineer], Director of Engineering for Powertron Global witnessed all of 
the measurements.
