The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR®  
Post measurement period for the Data Center Provider – [Southeast Location] Metro Chiller Unit.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 3125 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: 0.45 kW/ton * 3,397 tons = 1,528.7 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 1,528.7 kW * 2,500 Annual Operating Hrs = 3,821,750 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 3,821,750 kWh * $.06 = $229,305
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: 0.41 kW/ton * 3,397 tons = 1,392.8 kW
Annual kWh Post: 1,392.8 kW * 2,500 hours = 3,482,000 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 3,482,000 kWh * .06 cents = $208,920
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $229,305 - $208,920 = $20,385
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $20,385 / 12 = $1,699
Initial Payback Period (IPP)
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot Chiller unit: $24,768
Estimated Initial Payback Period (IPP) for Pilot Chiller: $24,768 / $1,699 = 14.6 months
Estimated Annual Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for Pilot Chiller: 82.3%
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for 
Data Center Provider for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post 
Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems was when operating at the original energy 
profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the 
systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the 
most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the systems will now operate due to the 
restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the internal building set points with increased 
efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
