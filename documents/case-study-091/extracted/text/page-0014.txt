The following are the final calculated average performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR®  
Post measurement period for the Data Center Provider – Santa Clara II Chiller Unit.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 408 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: 0.49 kW/ton * 443 tons = 217.1 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 217.1 kW * 4,350 Annual Operating Hrs = 944,385 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 944,385 kWh * $.11 = $103,882
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: 0.44 kW/ton * 443 tons = 194.9 kW
Annual kWh Post: 194.9 kW * 4,350 hours = 847,815 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 847,815 kWh * .11 cents = $93,260
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $103,882 - $93,260 = $10,622
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $10,622 / 12 = $885
Initial Payback Period (IPP)
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot Chiller unit: $12,760
Estimated Initial Payback Period for Pilot Chiller: $12,760 / $885 = 14.4 months
Estimated Annual Rate of Return for Pilot Chiller: 83.2%
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for 
Data Center Provider for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post 
Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems was when operating at the original energy 
profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the 
systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrost NMR® ECM was installed. This regression analysis is the 
most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the systems will now operate due to the 
restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the internal building set points with increased 
efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
