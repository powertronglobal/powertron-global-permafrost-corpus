Study Overview

This report details the results of the recently completed comprehensive energy performance study conducted at

the Regional Telecom Headquarters in Show Low, AZ.

Running from August 21 to October 5, 2015, the pilot was designed to illustrate the positive impact the

PermaFrost NMR® energy control measures (ECM) would have on the performance of the wall mounted cell tower

shelter air conditioning system.

As demonstrated in this ﬁeld trial, PermaFrost NMR® restores the cooling capacity on the systems lost over time due to

thermal degradation of the heat exchange surfaces. The ECM will beneﬁt Regional Telecom in any or all of the following ways:

• Restore capacity of the cooling systems to better satisfy ﬂuctuating shelter loads

• Produce additional cooling system redundancy at no extra cost or interruption to operations

• Improve cooling system efﬁciency, lowering cost to produce each ton of cooling required

• Restoring thermal efﬁciency, allowing cooling systems to achieve thermostat set points faster

• Improve cooling system performance, reducing runtime and extending equipment life by 15%+

• Reduce amp draw and kW and overall kWh consumption

• Reducing operating systems pressures in compressors, reducing unscheduled service calls

The improvements demonstrated in this or any ﬁeld test resulting from PermaFrost NMR® are dependent on

factors such as age, condition, service history, runtime of one or both compressors and the design and

application of each system. The results in this pilot were very consistent with 10+ year historical performance

averages as well as the recent laboratory study completed in May, 2015 on DX equipment by Underwriters

Laboratories (UL) in their testing chambers in [Texas Location], TX.

Setting the Stage for the Study

The location chosen for this pilot (#1) is a standard cell tower shelter supported by two 3-ton wall-mounted

cooling systems operating in a redundant fashion. The systems are rotated so runtime on each is balanced out

over time. The primary cooling system is normally set to 72 degrees as it was for the pilot, while the back-up

cooling system is set for 78 degrees so it only operates when the shelter load gets so heavy that the single

cooling system can no longer keep up or it malfunctions. At the start of the pilot the average temperature in the

data center was 73 degrees.  In normal late summer weather, the pilot cooling system #1 was able to satisfy its 72

degrees set point and cycle off on a regular basis. By restoring the majority of any lost capacity, once PermaFrost

NMR® is allowed to work, the expectation is that the cooling systems should produce cooler, drier air and thus

reach set point quicker so the system runs less.

Financial Beneﬁts of the Study

Regional Telecom will realize the following ﬁnancial beneﬁts from investing $308 on the installation of PermaFrost

NMR® in the cell tower cooling system included in this study:

• Energy Savings (annual)
$  440

• Avoided cost of additional capacity replacement @ $1000/ton
$ 480

• Capital improvement deduction
$ 308

• Initial Payback Period (all inclusive)
3 months

• Initial Payback Period (energy only)
8.3 months

• Annual Rate of Return (energy only)
143%

• Return On Investment over 5 years (energy only)
714%

Highlights of the Study

When comparing the pilot cell tower cooling system before and four weeks after PermaFrost NMR® was installed,

below are some of the highlights of the study:

• When initially tested, the pilot system was producing 2.35 tons of cooling. Four weeks after installation,

the cooling capacity was restored by .48 tons or 20.4% to 2.83 tons.

• The overall cost to produce each ton of cooling on the pilot system dropped 25.4% from 2.01 kW/ton

in the baseline to 1.5 kW/ton four weeks after installation of the ECM. This means that for every ton of

cooling the pilot system is asked to produce, Regional Telecom is spending 25.4% less money to do so.

• The projected annual kWh’s were reduced by 25.3% from 17,070 to 12,750.

• The conditions inside the cell tower shelter remained constant at 73 degrees while the cooling system

ran less but produced more tonnage.

• The average kW dropped 10% from 4.72 in the baseline to 4.25 in the post when comparing multiple

hour-long blocks of time under similar outdoor air temperatures affecting the condensing units. The

true effect of these savings over time are further explained in the regression analysis.

The cell tower cooling system involved in the study is recorded as follows:

Bard, Mfg date: 2004, R22, Nominal 3-tons, 240 volt- single Phase, Model W372-A05XP

Objectives

1. Determine that the “as-is” capacity and efﬁciency of the pilot cooling system supporting the

Regional Telecom complex had degraded by at least 10% after 14 years in operation.

2. Demonstrate at least 10% performance improvement in tonnage and/or corresponding kW/ton and

energy reduction in the pilot cooling system four weeks after installing PermaFrost NMR®.

3. Demonstrate the ability of the pilot cooling system to produce cooler, drier air as measured in both Dry

Bulb and Wet Bulb deltas after being treated.

4. To support an effective business case for further deployments of the ECM within the Regional Telecom

portfolio of properties, demonstrate ﬁnancial beneﬁts associated with efﬁciency improvements realized

over the duration of the study. These beneﬁts must be equivalent to a 24-month or less payback to

Regional Telecom on their initial project costs.

ECM Product Brief

PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented surface science nanotechnology that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative

(NMR®) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost

NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type of climate control system in which it is installed.  The direct beneﬁts

of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling efﬁciency and increased capacity.

Methodology

After verifying the amount of air ﬂowing across the evaporator coils before beginning each pilot, the subsequent

measurements used in the efﬁciency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with Option B of

the IPMVP (International Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol).

The results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic

engineering formulas:

• kW= Volts * Amps * Power Factor * Sq Rt 3 /1000 (for 3-Phase)

• kW/ton= Actual Measured Energy / Actual Measured Capacity

• Coefﬁcient of Performance (COP)= 12 / (kW/ton) /3.412

• Actual Cooling Capacity per Hour= (Measured CFM * 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta T) / 12,000 BTU

The four key objectives for this jointly-conducted PermaFrost NMR® pilot study between Powertron Global and 
Regional Telecom were all achieved.  They included:

---

Improved Unit Cost

The “Unit Cost” in the HVAC industry is the kW/ton ratio.

KW/ton is commonly used for larger commercial and

industrial air conditioning, heat pump and refrigeration

systems. It is the HVAC industry’s standard of

determining how much energy is required to create a

single ton of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). When you

reduce the unit cost of cooling, the client is saving

energy regardless of how much overall cooling they

require.

The chart to the right clearly illustrates the amount of

efﬁciency restoration the ECM created in the pilot

cooling system just 4 weeks after treatment. The treated

pilot cooling system is now performing 25.4% more

efﬁciently than before being treated. This degradation in

operational efﬁciency was costing Regional Telecom a

substantial amount of money in wasted energy.

Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics

The following are the ﬁnal calculated average performance measurements before and after the ECM was installed

on the pilot cooling system.

Average Baseline Energy Consumption

Baseline Capacity:  2.35 tons

Adjusted kW Baseline:  2.01 kW/ton * 2.83 tons = 5.69 kW

Adjusted Baseline kWh:  5.69 kW * 3,000 Annual Operating Hours = 17,070 kWh

Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 17,070 kWh * $.102 = $1,741

Average Post Energy Consumption

kW Post:  1.5 kW/ton * 2.83 tons = 4.25 kW

Annual kWh Post:  4.25 kW * 3,000 hours = 12,750 kWh

Annual Cost Post:  12,750 kWh * $.102 cents = $1,301

Average Savings Per Year Per Unit

Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year:  $1,741 - $1,301 = $440

Estimated Energy Savings per Month: $440 / 12 = $37

Return on Investment

Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot cooling system: $308

Estimated ROI for Regional Telecom when treating the pilot cooling system: $308 / $37 = ~8.3 mos

Annual Internal Rate of Return = 143%

Return on Investment Over 5 Years = 714%

Explanation of Regression Analysis

To obtain an avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Regional Telecom for implementing PermaFrost

NMR®, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy savings resulting from the improvement

in both capacity and efﬁciency utilizing data collected during the pilot study. Working together, these

improvements reduce the annual kWh expended in the Post Analysis Period. The ROI comes from determining

what the cost to run the cooling systems was when operating at the original energy proﬁle to produce the newly

restored amount of available capacity and then subtracting the revised cost to run the cooling systems at the

same restored capacity after the PermaFrost NMR® was installed. This regression analysis is the most widely

accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours and/or load % at which the systems will now

operate due to the restored performance proﬁle. This restored performance proﬁle allows the cooling systems to

satisfy the internal area set points with increased efﬁciency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading or

runtime.
