Executive Summary
        This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure 
(ECM) PermaFrost NMR® for Company B/Location B in Miami, FL. Detailed forensic performance testing 
(outlined later in this report) was performed on a 7.5 ton American Standard split-system DX unit equipped 
with R-22 refrigerant. 
Immediately following the baseline testing, the units was treated 
with the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® product 
formulated for R-22 DX systems. Since there were no other 
ECM’s going on during this pilot project, the improvement in 
efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at the units is 
solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. The unit(s) 
now provides cooler/drier supply air while using less power. 
This greater operational efficiency is due to the restoration of the 
heat transfer ability of the evaporator and condenser coils.
Following treatment of PermaFrost NMR® the unit showed an 
increase in coil capacity of 7,956 Btuh or 7.8% improvement 
overall system efficiency. The unit also showed a reduction in 
Watts/Ton of 6.5% and a 7.8% improvement in the Enthalpy 
Delta. Additionally, the unit showed a 6.9% improvement in 
EER. The Delta T improved by 1.1 degrees which is another 
measurable way to view the thermodynamic enhancement of the 
PermaFrost NMR® ECM. 
The results table of the ECM improvements is available for 
review at the end of this report.
