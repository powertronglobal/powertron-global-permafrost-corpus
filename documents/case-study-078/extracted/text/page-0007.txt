Energy Reporting Period
The identical IPMVP data recordings from the baseline were recorded on date using the same recently NIST 
calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. The measurements are as follows: 
The DB temperature (76 deg. F) entering the coil was matched exactly to the baseline period. After matching 
this temperature the post readings were taken to ensure that the work the coil had to do was the same in the 
baseline.
