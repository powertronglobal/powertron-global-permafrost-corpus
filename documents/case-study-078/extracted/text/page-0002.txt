Product Brief
         Our multi patented surface science nanotechnology is a sustainable surface science technology that 
lasts for the remaining useful life of any type of system in which it’s installed.  All types, designs and 
configurations of HVACR equipment qualifies for the benefit of treatment as long as the equipment 
utilizes refrigerant-based cooling as part of the design.
PermaFrost NMR® is a Nanotechnology that uses the patented Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) 
technology as its core agent. When installed into the low side refrigerant port, the product immediately 
goes to work restoring optimal heat transfer characteristics to the coils. Through polar synthesis,
PermaFrost NMR® embeds into the microscopic lattice structure of metal surfaces within the refrigeration
circuit as a thermal transfer agent, forming a passive nano-magnetic film. This process enhances the
conductivity of the metal and creates a permanent thermal coating that maintains optimal heat transfer
efficiency for the remaining life cycle of the equipment.
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance through increased capacity, 
and enhanced laminar refrigerant flow – all of which allows a system to achieve set point temperatures 
faster resulting in reduced compressor cycle periods and /or increased compressor unloading. 
The indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment 
include reduced run time, less kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor and longer overall 
equipment life.
