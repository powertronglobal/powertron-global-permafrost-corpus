Conclusion
The IPMVP calculations and results for the referenced American Standard Split HVAC system model # 
TTA090 Condenser and the TWE090 air handler do not reflect the initial published design performance 
intent. This is indicative of many systems due to the variables that effect performance in-situ. 
The ARI Standards for determining the capacity of forced air coils AHRI-410-2001 sets standards for testing 
that qualify the printed statements of manufacturers. Equipment in-situ rarely matches these standard tests. 
Therefore although there are capacity levels within this report that do not coincide with published data 
from the respective manufacturer it is due to the following:
1. CFM is greater than the design intent.
2. Entering air for the evaporator coil is cooler than design intent.
3. Entering air for the condenser coil is cooler than the design intent.
All of the above in-situ conditions have altered the performance expected baseline and post analysis but 
since these conditions were repeated during the post analysis or avoided energy cost period the level of 
uncertainty is acceptable within the confines of the IPMVP.
The facility at Arcola Park has been used off and on in the last ten years with limited usage hours from area 
community groups. The park is almost never open before 12:00 PM. This unit is an older machine but do to
