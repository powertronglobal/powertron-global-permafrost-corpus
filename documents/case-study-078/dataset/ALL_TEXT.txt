Product Brief
         Our multi patented surface science nanotechnology is a sustainable surface science technology that 
lasts for the remaining useful life of any type of system in which it’s installed.  All types, designs and 
configurations of HVACR equipment qualifies for the benefit of treatment as long as the equipment 
utilizes refrigerant-based cooling as part of the design.
PermaFrost NMR® is a Nanotechnology that uses the patented Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) 
technology as its core agent. When installed into the low side refrigerant port, the product immediately 
goes to work restoring optimal heat transfer characteristics to the coils. Through polar synthesis, PermaFrost NMR® embeds into the microscopic lattice structure of metal surfaces within the refrigeration circuit as a thermal transfer agent, forming a passive nano-magnetic film. This process enhances the conductivity of the metal and creates a permanent thermal coating that maintains optimal heat transfer efficiency for the remaining life cycle of the equipment.
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance through increased capacity, 
and enhanced laminar refrigerant flow – all of which allows a system to achieve set point temperatures 
faster resulting in reduced compressor cycle periods and /or increased compressor unloading. 
The indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment 
include reduced run time, less kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor and longer overall 
equipment life.

Executive Summary
        This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure 
(ECM) PermaFrost NMR® for Company B/Location B in Miami, FL. Detailed forensic performance testing 
(outlined later in this report) was performed on a 7.5 ton American Standard split-system DX unit equipped 
with R-22 refrigerant. 
Immediately following the baseline testing, the units was treated 
with the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® product 
formulated for R-22 DX systems. Since there were no other 
ECM’s going on during this pilot project, the improvement in 
efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at the units is 
solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. The unit(s) 
now provides cooler/drier supply air while using less power. 
This greater operational efficiency is due to the restoration of the 
heat transfer ability of the evaporator and condenser coils.
Following treatment of PermaFrost NMR® the unit showed an 
increase in coil capacity of 7,956 Btuh or 7.8% improvement 
overall system efficiency. The unit also showed a reduction in 
Watts/Ton of 6.5% and a 7.8% improvement in the Enthalpy 
Delta. Additionally, the unit showed a 6.9% improvement in 
EER. The Delta T improved by 1.1 degrees which is another 
measurable way to view the thermodynamic enhancement of the 
PermaFrost NMR® ECM. 
The results table of the ECM improvements is available for 
review at the end of this report.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) is used to develop this 
report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and 
Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the 
IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and 
products.
There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They 
are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.
Retrofit Isolation (Option B) is defined as: All parameter measurement with the boundary of the ECM 
(PermaFrost NMR®) as the single source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of 
the energy use of the energy conservation method affected equipment or system and any performance 
enhancements versus the baseline data.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term 
measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by 
short-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using 
measurements of proxies of energy use.
The final computation follows the formula:
The final computation follows the formula:

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content of the following report will demonstrate the effects of PermaFrost NMR®’s ability to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces. 
It was determined with Li Gurau M.E. for Company C to treat the American Standard 
split-system DX unit. A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment is implemented to determine if the 
unit’s operational conditions are satisfactory. Baseline measurements will be recorded and then the proper 
amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® will be injected. The product will be allowed 4 weeks to seat itself 
into the metal surfaces before post measurements were taken to establish the efficiency gains. 
The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP International Performance Measurement and 
Verification Protocol as the M&V plan. The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global’s Senior 
Energy Engineer [Senior Energy Engineer] ME/CEM/CMC/CMVP.
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
kW = Volts X Amps * .9 Single Phase or 1.47 Three Phase / 1000
 
Enthalpy =  Return Air WB Deg. F and Supply Air WB Deg. F Converted to Enthalpy
 
Actual Btuh Capacity = Measured CFM X 4.5 * Enthalpy Delta 
 
System Eﬃciency % = Actual Coil Capacity Btuh / Nominal Coil Capacity Btuh
 
EER = Btuh / Watts

Energy Reporting Period
The identical IPMVP data recordings from the baseline were recorded on date using the same recently NIST 
calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. The measurements are as follows: 
The DB temperature (76 deg. F) entering the coil was matched exactly to the baseline period. After matching 
this temperature the post readings were taken to ensure that the work the coil had to do was the same in the 
baseline.

Conclusion
The IPMVP calculations and results for the referenced American Standard Split HVAC system model # 
TTA090 Condenser and the TWE090 air handler do not reflect the initial published design performance 
intent. This is indicative of many systems due to the variables that effect performance in-situ. 
The ARI Standards for determining the capacity of forced air coils AHRI-410-2001 sets standards for testing 
that qualify the printed statements of manufacturers. Equipment in-situ rarely matches these standard tests. 
Therefore although there are capacity levels within this report that do not coincide with published data 
from the respective manufacturer it is due to the following:
1. CFM is greater than the design intent.
2. Entering air for the evaporator coil is cooler than design intent.
3. Entering air for the condenser coil is cooler than the design intent.
All of the above in-situ conditions have altered the performance expected baseline and post analysis but 
since these conditions were repeated during the post analysis or avoided energy cost period the level of 
uncertainty is acceptable within the confines of the IPMVP.
The facility at Arcola Park has been used off and on in the last ten years with limited usage hours from area 
community groups. The park is almost never open before 12:00 PM. This unit is an older machine but do to

its application of cooling a room that isn’t occupied very often we believe this unit doesn’t have the typical 
runtime on it that a unit of this age and geography would therefore it has not degraded in efficiency in 
respect to the issues associated with thermal inefficiency. This unit may not be the norm of the Company C portfolio.
