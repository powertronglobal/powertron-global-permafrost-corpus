All types, designs and \nconfigurations of HVACR equipment qualifies for the benefit of treatment as long as the equipment \nutilizes refrigerant-based cooling as part of the design.\nPermaFrost NMR® is a Nanotechnology that uses the patented Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) \ntechnology as its core agent. When installed into the low side refrigerant port, the product immediately \ngoes to work restoring optimal heat transfer characteristics to the coils. Through polar synthesis, PermaFrost NMR® embeds into the microscopic lattice structure of metal surfaces within the refrigeration circuit as a thermal transfer agent, forming a passive nano-magnetic film. This process enhances the conductivity of the metal and creates a permanent thermal coating that maintains optimal heat transfer efficiency for the remaining life cycle of the equipment.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance through increased capacity, \nand enhanced laminar refrigerant flow – all of which allows a system to achieve set point temperatures \nfaster resulting in reduced compressor cycle periods and /or increased compressor unloading. \nThe indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment \ninclude reduced run time, less kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor and longer overall \nequipment life.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 498, "chars": 2489, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_072_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:6b1d2cd6bb154c6c6bb8bc234923e6f77d3b66df6412f5971e6ef4db4f1c41b4"}

Detailed forensic performance testing \n(outlined later in this report) was performed on a 7.5 ton American Standard split-system DX unit equipped \nwith R-22 refrigerant. \nImmediately following the baseline testing, the units was treated \nwith the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® product \nformulated for R-22 DX systems. Since there were no other \nECM’s going on during this pilot project, the improvement in \nefficiency and restored capacity gained directly at the units is \nsolely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. The unit(s) \nnow provides cooler/drier supply air while using less power. \nThis greater operational efficiency is due to the restoration of the \nheat transfer ability of the evaporator and condenser coils.\nFollowing treatment of PermaFrost NMR® the unit showed an \nincrease in coil capacity of 7,956 Btuh or 7.8% improvement \noverall system efficiency. The unit also showed a reduction in \nWatts/Ton of 6.5% and a 7.8% improvement in the Enthalpy \nDelta. Additionally, the unit showed a 6.9% improvement in \nEER. The Delta T improved by 1.1 degrees which is another \nmeasurable way to view the thermodynamic enhancement of the \nPermaFrost NMR® ECM. \nThe results table of the ECM improvements is available for \nreview at the end of this report.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 472, "chars": 2066, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_072_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_072_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:a3d0d2d85552f26375d7b71966df3533ac4cb314e4e3a471b6aa52b7373f7283"}

The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and \nAir-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the \nIPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation methods and \nproducts.\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report.\nRetrofit Isolation (Option B) is defined as: All parameter measurement with the boundary of the ECM \n(PermaFrost NMR®) as the single source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of \nthe energy use of the energy conservation method affected equipment or system and any performance \nenhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using \nmeasurements of proxies of energy use.\nThe final computation follows the formula:\nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+ - Routine Adjustments + - Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 444, "chars": 2206, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_072_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_072_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:79f59618052471a2d65f440bb3ba0d775ab434b0d8dca21190b4b385060ad9e3"}

This is indicative of many systems due to the variables that effect performance in-situ. \nThe ARI Standards for determining the capacity of forced air coils AHRI-410-2001 sets standards for testing \nthat qualify the printed statements of manufacturers. Equipment in-situ rarely matches these standard tests. \nTherefore although there are capacity levels within this report that do not coincide with published data \nfrom the respective manufacturer it is due to the following:\n1. CFM is greater than the design intent.\n2. Entering air for the evaporator coil is cooler than design intent.\n3. Entering air for the condenser coil is cooler than the design intent.\nAll of the above in-situ conditions have altered the performance expected baseline and post analysis but \nsince these conditions were repeated during the post analysis or avoided energy cost period the level of \nuncertainty is acceptable within the confines of the IPMVP.\nThe facility at Arcola Park has been used off and on in the last ten years with limited usage hours from area \ncommunity groups.
