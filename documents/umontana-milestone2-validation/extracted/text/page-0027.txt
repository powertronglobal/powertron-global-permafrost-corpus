not. May days are represented largely by archetypes 1 and 2, a more efficient archetype combined 
with another where compressor 2 is turned off. A 4-archetype set would most likely split up the 
behavior better, but would not generate a significant reduction in the reconstruction error.   
 
Figure 25 - 3D Plot of Data Points as Represented by 3 Alpha's  
The simplex is enclosed by the triangle. Red points are from May 2020, blue from October 2019. 
 
From this, it is evident that the pre-treatments are less efficient than the post-treatments, as would 
be hoped.  It coincides with the findings of PowerTron in its Department Store A PermaFrost NMR Confirmatory 
Test report (August 18, 2020). 
 
Another way to represent the data is a 3D plot of the mixture coefficients.  These will lie on a simplex 
(represented by the triangular face in Figure 25) because the sum of the alpha’s for each data point 
will be 1, and the alpha’s themselves range between 0 and 1.  Thus, each data point (cooling day) is 
represented (approximately) by a convex combination of alpha’s and can be plotted on a 3-D 
simplex in the case of 3 archetypes.   The first 6 days of Oct. 2019 lie in a cluster near archetype 3.  
The last 2 days are closer to archetype 1.  This archetype captures the lower temperature days on 
Oct. 7th and 8th (see figure 21).  The data points in May lie near the simplex edge between archetype 
1 and 2, and thus are well represented by a convex combination of the two.  This allows for a 
variation in efficiency and whether or not compressor 2 is on.
