A histogram of the OAT (Figure 32) results into bins provided a reasonable approach for any given 
3-minute “on” interval to identify the number of compressors “active” (identified with a value = 1).  A 
review of the source data velocities, coupled with the number of compressors active provided a 
means to assign a relevant velocity measure, with variance allowed for based on differing humidity 
levels by month.

Resulting compressor count and velocity calculation: 
compressor 1 active as per Macy’s actual data:  600 * humidity1 
If OAT >= 78.5 = 2 compressors:  600 * humidity1 * 1.5 
If OAT >= 85.5 = 3 compressors:  600 * humidity1 * 2.0 
If OAT > 90 = 4 compressors:  600 * humidity1 * 2.5 
The remaining 6 source data variables (current and voltage readings) were taken from the original 
source data as no significant anomalies were detected. 
With these 12 variables for each 3-minute interval (166,430 of which 39,853 were compressor 
active), manual calculations of all interim and final KPI’s were performed and captured, leading to a 
38-field simulation data set. 
A random sample of 8,000 active records was then subjected to a process of additional calculation 
(where OAT was arbitrarily increased by 15 degrees for calculation purposes only), with the resulting 
KPI’s being labeled as anomalies.  An additional field was created to label each record as a “1” 
(8,000 anomaly records) or a “0” (31,853 non-anomaly records). 
The simulation model for calculating anomaly values in the KPI’s is relatively easy to adjust and 
other methods to calculate the anomalies may be useful for building a machine learning “train/test” 
model that could be later applied to the actual Macy’s data. 
Conclusion on Simulated Data Set 
When MAD and Random Forest were applied to the labeled simulated data set, unfortunately results 
produced were inconclusive. The manually created ‘anomalies’ were not identified in a consistent 
manner by either algorithm and further exploration via modifications to the simulation set were not 
possible due to time constraints.
