Figure 12 - Normalized Data 
 
 
Figure 11 represents the data prior to normalizing the measurements, while Figure 12 shows 
the normalized characteristics. Normalization shifts and rescales the data points within a field 
(e.g. kW/Ton or Median COP) so they end in a scale from 0 to 1 and thus are more similar 
across the dataset3. The normalized point is generated by evaluating all data points within each 
feature to find a range, then taking the raw data point, subtracting the minimum data point within 
the field and dividing the result by the range for the field.

The normalized data points illustrate the raw measurements in a controlled fashion, facilitating 
the visualization and comparison of the points within the set. This is important when building 
complex comparisons, such as the distance matrix seen in the next sub-section. 
 
 
Basis of the Algorithm 
 
The process used by the hierarchical clustering algorithm to compare and then cluster the data is 
what makes each algorithm unique. Hierarchical clustering builds a hierarchy based on the distance 
of each object from other objects in the multi-variate space. Consider mapping each object in a 
space with many dimensions (in this case, each day in a space with 7 dimensions) and then 
analyzing the distance between each point. 
 
It is helpful to start by imagining a generic data set where each object is characterized by only two 
measurements i.e. each object has two features used to compare it to other objects in the set. The 
algorithm begins by creating a distance matrix, also referred to as a dissimilarity matrix, to calculate 
the distance between each object. 
 
An example of the distance matrix produced for this generic, two-feature data set is shown in Figure 
13 below4.
