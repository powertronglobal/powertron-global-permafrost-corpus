Find the deviations from the median 
deviations  =  
 
{ -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 96 } 
 
Take the absolute value 
absolute deviations  =  
 
{ 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 96 } 
 
Find the median of the absolute 
sorted absolute deviations =  
deviations 
{ 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 96 } 
 
MAD = 2 
 
Using the MAD, thresholds can be set:   median +/- MAD * tolerance factor. In the above data set, 
using a tolerance factor of 3, our thresholds would be set at -2 and 10 (4 +/- 2*3).  Thus, any values 
below -2 or above 10 would be considered outliers. 
 
Results and Possible Use Cases 
 
Consider an example from the Macy’s data set during the month of May 2020. The data was filtered 
so that only values where compressor 1 was on and cfm > 100 were considered. (Figures 9 and 
10).  The median kW/ton in the May 2020 dataset was 1.09, while the MAD was 0.19. On May 4, 
2020, 1.85% of the data were outliers (Figure 9), but on May 5th, 52.98% of the values were 
outliers (Figure 10).  This breach in the threshold could indicate a malfunction and warrant further 
investigation.   
 
Figure 9 - kW/Ton Outliers in May 2020 (Department Store A) 
Outliers in the kW/Ton measurements are marked with a red dot; outliers in the CFM measurements are 
notated with a green dot, while blue marks standard kW/Ton measurements over time.
