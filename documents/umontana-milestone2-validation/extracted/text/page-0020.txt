Figure 18 - kW/Ton against Outside Air Temperature 
kW/Ton are measured on the y-axis; outdoor air temperature is measured on the x-axis; each point represents a day 
in the data set and the color of the point indicates the assigned cluster 
 
 
From Figure 17, a conclusion can be reached regarding the COP measurements for the clustered 
data points in yellow. Simply stated, the COP represents the heat removed by the device and thus a 
higher COP is better when the device is on. The yellow data points from October (pre-treatment) 
manifest a low COP even when the temperature outside is measured near it’s highest i.e. the device 
is not succeeding in removing large amounts of heat at high temperatures pre-treatment. Post-
treatment the COP increases dramatically for the majority of the data points, with the exception of a 
handful of outliers. This means that the algorithm proves the effectiveness and confirms the 
expected positive impact that PowerTron’s treatment has on the device. The effect is sure enough 
that even an algorithm that is fed unlabeled data picks up on the trend. 
 
Figure 18 manifests a similar proof of expected treatment outcomes in the kW/Ton measurement. If 
a treatment were intended to improve the efficiency of a device, one would expect the amount of 
electricity used to supply a given amount of cooling to decrease. This is seen as the kW/Ton for 
those pre-treatment October days is clustered in the upper right hand of Figure 18 where the 
grouping of cluster 1, yellow dots are located. This indicates the majority of data post-treatment 
shows less energy being used to provide the same amount cooling, despite high temperature 
readings. The algorithm, despite not knowing which days were pre and post-treatment, has identified 
the difference in pre and post-treatment data and once again proves the efficacy of PowerTron’s 
PermaFrost treatment on the Macy’s unit. 
An existing use of such findings is to use the data in advertising or marketing the treatment to 
prospective clients. This is evident from a high-level exploration, but also overlooks certain potential
