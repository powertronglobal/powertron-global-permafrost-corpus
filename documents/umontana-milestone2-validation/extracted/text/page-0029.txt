Figure 26 - Matrix Identifying Relationships Between Variables  
Variables marked in red font were not used in the calculation of the efficiency KPIs 
 
Within the source data for Department Store A, 15 months of complete or partial data was presented, captured in 
1 second intervals. The result of this measurement frequency was an extremely large dataset only 
representative of a single year of data potentially impacted by seasonal weather variances.  
Methodology for Producing Simulated Data 
After examining and constructing the above table representing the relationship between source and 
calculated variables, development of simulated data began. Initially to ensure accurate construction 
of a dataset, the period and timing of source data, average relative humidity and high/low 
temperatures for Denton, Texas were gathered and used to create relevant values for the 15 month 
period in the source data.  Average monthly low temperature was set for 6:00 AM on the 15th day of
