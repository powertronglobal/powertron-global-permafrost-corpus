Further investigation into the dates listed shows anomalies, so the algorithm is at least partially 
successful in the identification of anomalies. For instance, consider the first anomaly July 12, 2020.  
Plotting kW/ton for that day and the surrounding days which were not flagged as anomalous, 
produces the results shown in Figure 7. 
 
Figure 7 - July 11th - 13th  2020 Plots 
The left vertical axis represents kW/Ton (blue values), while the vertical axis on the right represents the number of 
compressors running (black line). The first graph represents the 11th, the second the 12th and the third the 13th.
