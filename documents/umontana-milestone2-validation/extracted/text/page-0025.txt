Figure 22 - Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) vs. Number of Archetypes for the Oct2019/May2020 
Data Set  
The algorithm creates a set of N archetypes sequentially, each accompanied with the total error (RSS) in 
representing the data with that set of archetypes 
 
With only one archetype computed the error is roughly 118.5, but drops quickly when a two 
archetype set is computed.  We chose to truncate at 3 archetypes; adding any more does not 
significantly affect the accuracy of the data reconstruction.  Archetypal analysis thus reduces the 
data set from 7 dimensions to 3, and the archetypes themselves are representative of typical 
“cooling days”.   A bar chart of the variables in each archetype is shown in figure 23. All three have 
similar large max temperatures, but archetype 2 is a more efficient day, as the median COP is larger 
and the Kw/ton is smaller for it than the other two. Also, compressors 1 and 2 have large capacity 
output, and both are on for a similar amount of time.  Archetypes 1 and 3 are less efficient days, with 
higher Kw/ton and lower COP.  Archetype 1 represents a day where compressor 2 is not turned on, 
and archetype 3 will capture less efficient days when both compressors are on. Each data point can 
be reconstructed by a convex combination of the 3 archetypes, and the mixture coefficients (the 
alphas) for each is plotted in figure 24.
