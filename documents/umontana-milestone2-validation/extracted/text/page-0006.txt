The data was filtered in two ways.  First, data points were only considered when Compressor 1 was 
on.  In the data set considered, there were four compressors labeled 1 – 4 that always came on in 
order.  Generally, Compressor 1 ran most frequently during the day; while Compressor 2 would 
periodically kick in to provide extra cooling capacity. Compressors 3 and 4 rarely ran. Second, data 
points were only considered when CFM was at least 100 cubic feet per minute. This helped to 
remove spikes in the calculations that occur when the machine is coming on or turning off, as CFM 
drops to zero at these times. 
 
Figures 5 and 6 below represent examples of the decision trees the random forest model generated 
from the pre-treated data for the selected dates.
