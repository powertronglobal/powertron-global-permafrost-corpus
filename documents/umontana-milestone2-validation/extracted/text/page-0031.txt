As is more apparent in this shorter time window, during a season of overall rising temperatures, the 
ratable drop in interval temperature following the high temperature point of the day is nominally less 
that were the ratable increases in interval temperature preceding the high temperature point of the 
day.  The opposite follows during a season of lowering temperatures. 
Humidity averages were applied evenly throughout the month identified to all 3-minute intervals 
contained in said month, depicted in Figure 30.6
