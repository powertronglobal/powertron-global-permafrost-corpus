Figure 15 - Dendrogram of October 2019/May 2020 Data 
 
 
The y-axis in figure 15 is used to measure the height of the line connecting each object notated on 
the x-axis. The taller the line representing the linkage between objects, the further apart those 
objects are calculated to be. The colors within the dendrogram indicate the cluster assignments and 
suggest that 4 clusters should be used when assigning clusters within the data. 
 
At this point, all the inputs have been collected to run the hierarchical clustering algorithm that 
produces a matrix assigning a cluster (cluster 0, 1, 2 or 3) to all 38 days included in the dataset. The 
output matrix is seen in figure 16.  
 
Figure 16 - Cluster Assignments within October 2019/May 2020 Dataset 
 
The highlighted days in figure 16 are the first 8 days listed in the dataset i.e. the days from October 
2019, the others listed are days in May 2020. There is some overlap in the measured device 
behavior on days 7 and 8, as they fell into the ‘0’ cluster where the majority of days in that cluster are 
days from May. This overlap is minimal as the remaining days from October were recognized as a 
cluster of their own, not containing any data sets from May 2020.
