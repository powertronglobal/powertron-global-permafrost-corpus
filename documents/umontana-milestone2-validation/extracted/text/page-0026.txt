Figure 23 - Bar Chart Representation of the 3 Archetype Set  
Each archetype is like a data point from the set and made up of magnitudes of each of the seven measurement 
variables (betas). 
 
Figure 24 - Mixture Coefficients (alphas) for each data point, 1-38 
The vertical line runs through Oct. 8th, the last day of the Oct. 2019 data set. From there on, the data points (days) 
are in May. Thus, the line divides pre-treatment days and post-treatment days 
 
The mixture coefficient time series in figure 24 illustrate that archetype 3, and then a mixture of 3 
and 1, represent the pre-treatment days. This is consistent with the properties of these two 
archetypes, and both are less efficient than archetype 2. The difference is if compressor 2 is on or
