Incorporating Machine Learning with Cloud Based HVAC Monitoring 
Systems 
 
Introduction 
 
As a final step in the M598-498 University of Montana Capstone, the team tested several machine 
learning and data science algorithms with the data given at the beginning of the semester. The goal 
of this exploration was to practice real world implementation of learned data science models while 
determining if initial results from any of the selected methods produced successful detection of 
anomalies within the dataset. Anomaly detection within the machine sensor data given to use posed 
obvious use cases when the exploration began, from real-time detection of machine inefficiencies 
and excessive energy use to the possibility of predictive mechanical failure.

Overall Limitations, Variables to Measure, and Conclusion 
 
Conclusions are discussed in detail in the limitations and potential use cases and suggestions, 
however success came largely from examining data sets pre and post-treatment by PowerTron. The 
lack of labelled data rendered the training of supervised models and assessment of results difficult. 
The team was able to explore whether algorithms could identify pre and post-treatment data in an 
effective fashion as the data was labeled as pre and post treatment. Possible success in 
identification of anomalies in the machine’s behavior is seen with threshold analyses of certain 
features, however this model’s lack of mechanism for confirming results produces immature findings 
that are difficult to verify. 
 
Section I. Feature Extraction and Exploration 
 
Feature Extraction   
  
In determining whether an HVAC system is performing within spec using sensor data, the team had 
to first determine which features should be used to best characterize the device’s performance.  
Feature extraction represents the process of choosing which criteria will be used to make this 
decision, aiding in any pre-treatment applied to the data.  
 
Initial meetings and reports provided by PowerTron combined with general research on HVAC 
function narrowed the teams approach to a focus on kW/ton, COP, and EER as appropriate 
measures of device efficiency.
