With outside air temperature (OAT) and humidity1 (H1) replaced by these values, a review of the 
average relationship between OAT and temp1, temp2 resulted in extrapolation of values for those 
additional columns; similarly, a review of H1 to humidity2 resulted in an extrapolation to populate 
humidity2. 
Figure 31 represents the average results for manual calculations simulating the Macy’s dataset.
