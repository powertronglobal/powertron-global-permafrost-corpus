To apply this method, one must choose the tolerance factor, the period of time for which the median 
is calculated, and how many outliers during a period would trigger an alert. For this exploration, the 
team selected a tolerance factor of 3, calculated the median in monthly increments, and specifically 
triggered the alert when the amount of outliers contained in the dataset amounted to 30% or more of 
the data within the set.  
 
Depending on the expected regularity of the data, one could ‘zoom in’ by reducing the threshold for 
percentage of the set classified to be outliers. If changes occur that may be of interest within smaller 
periods of time, the time increment for median calculation could be modified to ensure changes 
shifts in the median over time are not lost. To understand the best measurement conditions, selected 
presets for the algorithm should be tested via experiments on historical data to determine what 
provides the most pointed outcomes.  For example, median could be a running value calculated 
continuously, or could be calculated only on data taken during a matching outdoor air temperature.   
 
This model has potential to detect possible mechanical failure in real time, however more historical 
data would be needed to examine trends and set appropriate thresholds based on understanding of 
the data in previously recorded mechanical failure or malfunction. This use case may also need 
further variables not being calculated at this time, such as pressure, that may need more sensor 
equipment. Historical data would need to be labeled so results can be understood against real 
record of mechanical failure. 
 
Another key statistic that would be worth pulling on an ongoing basis to better assess this 
methodology would be a running measure of the spread of the data. 
 
This method has real potential use cases within its ability to be connected with an application and 
actively flagging the engineer or device user when an amount above the threshold of outliers is 
detected.
