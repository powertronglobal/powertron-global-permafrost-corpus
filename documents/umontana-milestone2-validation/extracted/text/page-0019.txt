There were also two outliers identified within the days from May, clustered within clusters 2 and 3. 
These are seen to be outliers as they are single days that were dissimilar enough from the points in 
clusters 0 and 1 that the algorithm chose to classify them in their own categories entirely. 
 
Overall, the result produced is reasonably successful, as the majority of days from the pre-treatment 
data were classified separately from the post-treatment data. This aligns with the expectation that 
the behavior of the device would be different between pre and post PermaFrost treatment 
implemented by PowerTron. 
 
To examine possibilities even further, the team decided to look at several scatter plots of the data, 
where the clusters have been identified. The two most interesting plots produced that illustrate not 
only the behavior of the clusters, but also the success of PowerTron’s treatment are shown below in 
figures 17 and 18. 
Figure 17 - COP Against Outside Air Temperature  
COP is measured on the y-axis; Outside air temperature is measured on the x-axis; Clusters are represented by the 
color of the points, which each represent a day; Note – The axes remain between 0 and 1 as the data has been 
normalized
