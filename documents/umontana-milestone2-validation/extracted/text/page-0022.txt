The team applied archetypal analysis to the summary data set produced by [Faculty Advisor A], 
where pre-treatment is described in the hierarchical clustering section.  Each data point represents 
one “cooling day” and contains some number of summary measurements for that day. To test the 
method, we combined the October 2019 data set with the May 2020 set, to see if archetypal analysis 
could distinguish pre- and post- treatment operation of the machine.  We chose a subset of the full 
summary data set, considering only the median values, and pruning variables that have a direct and 
obvious relation with each other.  For instance, the max OAtemp and the median OAtemp are 
plotted against each other in Figure 19.  A linear regression shows that they are the same variable, 
up to a vertical shift.  Therefore, one can be excluded without loss of generality.  We chose to retain 
the maximum daily temperature.  Similarly, EER and COP are also linearly related, as they are 
measurements of the same thing, in different units. See Figure 20.  We chose the median COP for 
our data set.  We then selected Kw/ton, which is inversely related to COP, generally speaking, but 
variations of this dependence could indicate varying operating conditions.  Also included are median 
total capacity in BTU tons when compressor 1 is on, and when compressors 1 and 2 are on.  Finally, 
the total time that compressor 1 and compressor 2 are on during the day were included.  
Compressor 3 and 4 are not always turned on each day, subject to control by the machine operator, 
but could be included in another round of analysis, as the total capacity will be effected by this.
