We can see the values for July 12th (middle graph) have a visually distinct pattern and are about 100 
times higher. The values are enough higher that the scale is modified automatically by the algorithm 
to show peaks of even over 200, while the 11th and the 13th both hover around 1.5 and 2.  
 
As a secondary result of this method, the random forest algorithm produces a list of features ranked 
by importance as they relate to the classification being performed by the algorithm. This list is shown 
in Figure 8. 
 
 
Figure 8 - Features by Importance 
 
 
The more ‘important’ a feature is, the more it impacts whether the algorithm distinguishes a day to 
be ‘normal’ or ‘anomalous.  This can be useful information in selecting features to report and 
investigate further.
