hotter outside. Preliminary results showed that runtime seemed to increase linearly with outside air 
temperature. 
By demonstrating a linear relationship between these two variables, linear regression allows for the 
creation an equation to model this relationship.  This equation was used to create a feature based on 
the deviation from the predicted relationship, where the deviation is referred to as an error.  If the 
error was consistently large, this would merit attention, as it could mean that the machine was not 
performing as expected. 
 
Each of the sub-sections under Section II: Deep Dive Methods, references the specific pre-treatment 
of data and the features extracted for each model tested. Feature extraction represents a key piece 
in any data science or machine learning implementation, as its impacts can range from the actual 
determination of which technique to explore to the actual success of the technique itself.  
 
The team believes that further features could have been explored in future exploration specifically 
related to the features and variables that one would need to assess for successful predictive 
mechanical failure. 
 
Section II. Deep Dive Methods 
 
The following subsections outline the methods explored further by the team given time constraints. 
Each section produced different results and conclusions surrounding the effectiveness of any of the 
given algorithms or methods are independent of one another. Common limitations and conclusions 
resulting from all deep dives are discussed in the final section of this paper. 
 
The Random Forest Algorithm 
 
Method Description 
 
The random rorest is a classification algorithm that will take a large set of inputs and put them into 
different categories. It is a "supervised" algorithm, which means that there must be a training set of 
data which allows for the machine to categorize future data sets based on given sample inputs and 
outputs. This is called labeled data.  Consider a data set gathered by surveying people on whether 
they would buy a certain cell phone.

Each input is a row representing a phone and can be thought of as a single data point with three 
features: price, RAM and internal storage.  The key desired output is whether someone would buy
