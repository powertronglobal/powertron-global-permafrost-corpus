Conclusion and Possible Use Case 
 
We have shown that archetypal analysis applied the summary variables chosen can differentiate 
between pre and post treatment days.  It also shows sensitivity to variation in outdoor temperature 
and whether compressor 2 is on.  We speculate that it could capture a gradual change in operating 
conditions through observations of the alpha’s.  If, over time, the data point drift from one condition 
to another, the representation in terms of archetypes would shift from all in the first archetypal 
condition, to all in the other, with points in between lying on the simplex boundary between the two.  
Another possible use would be the detection of anomalies.  First, a set of archetypes representing 
the usual operation of the machine is created, using a training set of the summary variables.  
Additional days could be tested by projecting their data points onto the archetypal set (an 
optimization problem with a nonlinear constraint).  If the error jumps up for the new data point, it 
could be anomalous.   The daily calculation on board the machine would be the creation of the 
summary variables, and a projection onto the archetypal set.  If an anomaly is detected, further 
classification that day’s variables could be done to identify the source of the anomaly.   
 
Lack of Test Data: An attempt to manually produce anomaly ridden data sets. 
 
A theme throughout the testing of various methods was the lack of annotated data that would allow 
the team to test each method against known anomalies in the data stemming from mechanical 
failure. As such, an attempt was made to manually produce a training set of data and then plant 
known anomalies or failures within the set.  
 
The following section describes the methodology used to develop the simulated set for 
documentation purposes only. The results from testing the methods described in previous sections 
on the simulated set were inconclusive. Further examination would be needed to determine the 
failure of the simulated data produced and modify the method accordingly. 
 
Basis for Manual Calculations 
 
From 25 fields of source data, 12 variables were used to produce 8 interim calculations, which then 
were used to calculate 5 key performance indicators related to the efficiency of the device. Manual 
replication of calculations was achieved via exploration of the relationships between all 
measurements. Figure 26 outlines the relationship between all variables and was also included in 
the team’s milestone 1 report.
