Conclusion and Possible Uses 
 
In conclusion, this method shows promise but needs more labeled data to fully evaluate. If 
PowerTron were able to provide a labeled data set with clear indicators of instances where an 
anomaly they were interested in tracking occurred, this algorithm could be used to investigate 
anomalies non-labeled datasets from other months of operation.  
 
Furthermore, when used in combination with other statistical models, it may be possible to create a 
deeper understanding of ‘warning signs’ that typify pre-breakdown behavior in a device. With this 
understanding, a labeled dataset could be created that trains the algorithm to detect pre-breakdown 
behavior and flag this occurrence in an active manner. 
 
Additionally, impacts of decisions made by building engineers and managements could be tracked. 
The training dataset would need labels for variable measurements known to be an outcome of a 
user behavior i.e. When building management decides to do x action, the COP/EER/etc do y. The 
algorithm would then identify and track these incidents over time. 
 
Obvious limitations to this method come rooted in the fact that it is a supervised learning algorithm 
requiring a training set of labeled data to produce results, thus requiring knowledge of what 
characterizes an anomaly prior to running the algorithm. Further findings and uses could possibly be 
generated via additional labeled data or data annotations describing decisions made by building 
engineers, mechanical issues, and more. 
 
Detecting outliers – An Analysis of Variability:   
 
Median Absolute Deviation from the Median (MAD) Method Description 
 
The Median Absolute Deviation from the Median (MAD) is a measure of variability. This idea of MAD 
was introduced in a talk by the head data scientist at Datadog.2 The method is more simply 
implemented than the interquartile range and is less impacted by outliers by using the median. While 
the values in any data set are expected to vary, if they change ‘too much’ it should trigger further 
investigation within an analysis. Defining ‘too much change’ within a dataset is commonly called 
"thresholding."  Thresholds are often set manually, but the team wanted to investigate if these 
thresholds could be automatically applied. If a machine could automatically and actively apply 
thresholds to a dataset characterizing machine behavior, the use cases would be extensive. 
 
The milestone 1 report for this project discussed using the interquartile range (IQR) to identify 
outliers.  Presented below is a similar method using a different statistic: the median absolute 
deviation from the median. 
 
MAD is calculated as follows:
