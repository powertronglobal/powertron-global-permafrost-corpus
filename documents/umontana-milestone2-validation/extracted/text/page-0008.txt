Results 
 
Typically, another labelled data set is used to test a supervised machine learning algorithm.  This 
data set will be used as input for the algorithm and the output will be compared to the known labels, 
allowing an accuracy percentage to be calculated. It follows that without more labelled data, it is not 
possible to conclusively test performance and produce precision accuracy measurements.  
 
While lacking an understanding of true method accuracy serves as a notable limitation stemming 
from an absence of labeled data, the team was able to mimic a testing data set by using pre and 
post-treatment data as ‘anomalies’. Once trained on the labeled data from the 39 days in October 
2019 and May 2020, the algorithm was applied to Department Store A data from June 2020 to November 2020 
and the following days were classified as anomalies:
