Results, Conclusions, and Possible Uses 
 
To begin, the team used the Euclidean distance and created a distance matrix between all 
points within the normalized data set. When calculated a 38 x 38 distance matrix was produced 
showing the distances between all 38 days assessed. A portion of this matrix can be seen in 
Figure 14.

From the matrix, the dendrogram is then produced, starting by grouping the closest two days, then 
adding the 3rd closest and so on until the iterative process has analyzed and assigned a cluster to 
each day. Figure 15 shows the dendrogram produced by the algorithm package when the October 
2019/May 2020 dataset is inputted.
