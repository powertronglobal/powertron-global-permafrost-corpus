Thus, the end conclusion on the manufactured anomalies and the simulated dataset was that the 
creation of this dataset would need to be either further explored and tested or abandoned. The 
simplest resolve would be to ensure real annotated data is collected as opposed to attempting to 
create a simulated set using the methodology described above. The limitation of the requirement for 
additional, labeled data to further examine methodologies explored was not resolved with this 
approach. Therefore, the need for labeled datasets for future exploration of methods stands. 
 
Overall Limitations, Variables to Measure, and Conclusion 
 
Limitations 
 
The standing limitation for the testing and exploration of all methodologies for anomaly detection was 
the lack of labeled data. The need for an understanding of real-life decisions made by building 
engineers, device failures, and more would aid in assessing the actual success of certain algorithms, 
especially those that function as supervised machine learning models. 
 
Time also proved to be a limitation, as the team had to first explore the data and possibilities for 
analysis as well as understand the HVAC process for interpretation of results. If data with notes, or 
even a log made by the building engineer with dates and times included, was produced, it would be 
possible to execute further examination of outliers or provide meaning to the clusters that an 
algorithm creates. Without this understanding, results bear success in a superficial manner that 
would benefit greatly from an on-the-ground understanding of the device’s behavior and potential 
factors impacting this behavior.  
 
Additional Variables to Actively Measure 
 
PowerTron expressed explicit interest in understanding whether actively taking additional 
measurements would aid in future explorations. The following bulleted list represents possible items 
to measure actively that would add value to the datasets currently being produced by PowerTron’s 
sensor technology: 
 
- 
Amount of time daily that each compressor is spent on 
- 
MAD for a selected increment (daily or monthly) 
- 
Maximum and Minimum daily values for each variable 
- 
Daily averages and medians for all variables 
- 
Any record of mechanical failure or sensor failure 
- 
Pressure (needing additional sensor equipment) 
 
Conclusion 
 
While the production of simulated data did not produce any additional results, preliminary results 
seen in the exploration of MAD, Random Forest, agglomerative hierarchical clustering, and 
archetypal analysis were promising and presented room for additional exploration.  
 
Possible use cases for such algorithms range from the ability to notify individuals of a breach in 
threshold in real time to the ability to examine the impact of usage decisions and changes to a
