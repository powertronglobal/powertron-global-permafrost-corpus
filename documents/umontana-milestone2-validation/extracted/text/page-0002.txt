Capacity was also examined as it has an implied value related compressor function. Capacity can be 
considered as a measure of the ability of the device to provide a certain amount of cooling. Based on 
manufacturing standards, there are expected values for capacity when one compressor is 
functioning, two compressors are functioning, and so on. Also related to compressor function was 
developing an understanding of extracting the amount of time one compressor, two compressors, 
three compressors, and four compressors were running in a given time period. This can be 
designated by either the total number of seconds a device was running during a day or by producing 
the average cycle runtime, manifested as a percentage. 
 
Outdoor air temperature has an expected relationship with certain key variables mentioned above, 
such as the kW/ton used by the machine. When the temperature outside increases, the amount of 
energy required to provide cooling capabilities increases.  
 
Included in the determination of which features to extract is the exploration of statistical 
representations of each measure over a given time period. Certain measurements are less impacted 
by sensor errors or expected spikes (outliers) in calculated measurements due to the common 
nature of equipment function.  
 
For instance, kW/ton is expected to spike when a device cycles and compressors turn on or off. 
When a device turns on, it’s capacity is close to zero, so the calculation results in the kW being 
divided by a very small number, which results in a very large kW/ton measurement. An effective 
statistical approach to handling spikes in calculated measurements is to take the median, as 
opposed to the mean (average), as it is less impacted by outliers in very large data sets. Hence, 
several features explored include the median kW/ton, COP, and the EER. 
 
The variability of the data provided was also assessed during feature extraction.  Typical statistics 
for the assessment of variability consist of the range, the interquartile range (the lower and upper 
boundaries of the middle 50% of the data), and the standard deviation.  Unfortunately, the mean and 
standard deviation (based on the mean) are impacted by ‘common’ outliers in this data set and were 
discarded.  The range, which reflects the minimum and maximum values in a given data set, was 
used.  The interquartile range was also used to calculate a useful feature known as "percentage of 
outliers in a day" (calculated by dividing the number of datum categorized as outliers by the number 
of points in the entire set under examination). 
 
Outliers indicate unusual values, and a point is classified as an outlier if it is further than some 
defined distance away from the median, known as thresholding. This is a categorical feature, which 
allows for determining whether a datum is or is not an outlier.  Related to outliers and the creation of 
thresholds, the median absolute deviation from the median (MAD) was calculated and used as a 
feature.  Much like standard deviation, which portrays the average distance from the mean, MAD 
illustrates the typical distance from the median of the data. 
 
Finally, by exploring the relationship between data points, one can produce additional features 
based on the identified relationships.  Particularly fruitful was the examination of the relationship 
between outside air temperature and average cycle runtime. The expected relationship would model 
an increase in cycle runtime with increases in temperature i.e. the device has to run for longer if it is
