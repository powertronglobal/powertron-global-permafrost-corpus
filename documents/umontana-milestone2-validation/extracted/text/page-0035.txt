device within the framework of historical device behavior. Several methods left space for deeper 
exploration to potential develop a method for predictive mechanical failure, however limitations 
mentioned would need to be addressed prior to implementing such exploration. 
 
Successful application of a variety of analysis methods represents a true positive outcome of this 
project and opens the door to many possibilities in the world of analyzing HVAC sensor data and 
applying it to improving current business offerings as well as the potential for offering an entirely new 
service to existing customers if sensors were maintained post-treatment.
