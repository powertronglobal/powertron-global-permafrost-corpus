a given month, while relevant high temperature was set for 6:00 PM of same day.  From these 
anchor points, outside air temperature was linearly distributed to all 3-minute intervals represented 
between these monthly centers, with ratable temperature increase from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM, and 
ratable decrease from 6:00 PM to 6:00 AM. This sampling is depicted in figures 27, 28, and 29.
