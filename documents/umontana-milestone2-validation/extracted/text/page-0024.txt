Dates are on the x-axis, units of the variable on the y-axis. Note that COP is unitless 
 
Prior to performing archetypal analysis, the 38 points are normalized in each dimension separately, 
by dividing each measurement by the maximum value of the measurement in the data set.  Thus, 
the variables all ranges between 0 and 1, with fractions representing percentages, e.g., 0.5 is 50% of 
the max value achieved by that variable in the data set.   
The first step in applying archetypal analysis is to compute the total error in representing the data in 
terms of the archetypes, in this case it is the residual sum of squares, or RSS.  The RSS is 
computed for each set of archetypes and decreases as a larger number of archetypes is taken.  See 
Figure 22.
