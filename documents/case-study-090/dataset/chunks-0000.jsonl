Detailed forensic performance \ntesting (outlined later in this report) was performed on 2 split system DX units. \nImmediately following the baseline testing, the units were treated with the proper amount and type of \nPermaFrost NMR® product formulated for R-22 DX systems. Since there were no other ECM’s going on \nduring this pilot project, the improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at the units is \nsolely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. The units now provide cooler/drier supply air while \nusing less power. This greater operational efficiency is due to the restoration of the heat transfer ability of \nthe evaporator and condenser coils.\nFollowing treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, the 2 units showed an average 35.9% \nreduction in kW/ton based on the exact capacity measured in the baseline M&V and the post gestation \nM&V. The units showed an average 50.9% reduction in kWh. Prior to the ECM, the units produced a total of \n4.64 tons of cooling. After the ECM, the tonnage produced increased to 6.09 tons. This capacity increase \nfrom the baseline performance level led to an effective net average increase in COP of 71.5%. All of these \nfactors directly correlate to what Major Golf Organization HQ building will realize in energy savings as they operate these \nunits in the future under the same parameters.\nThe result of the ECM improvements is a ROI to the customer of a matter of months. The tables of data and \nfinancial calculations are available for review at the end of this report.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 577, "chars": 2670, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_086_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:5cb787349edaf24c74120c554dc5a34499629b5ccada05857ade735860304013"}

A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type \nof system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVAC/R systems and equipment \nthat PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); chilled water \nsystems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia refrigeration plants \n(single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The equipment utilized in \nthese systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single and multi-stage), scroll, \nreciprocating and screw configurations.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and \nimproved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point temperatures in a more \nrapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from the \nenhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW hours \nused, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced carbon footprint for \nthe Major Golf Organization HQ.\nEnergy Science Division\nBOUNDARY LAYER\nOIL REMOVED\nBEFORE TREATMENT\nAFTER TREATMENT\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 440, "chars": 2109, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_086_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_086_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:753fe3db2b895cfd309d6ec0de1ac0f859321b82b93fefa10033dd0eadcba87b"}

The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, \nRefrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization \n(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation \nmethods and products.\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Retrofit Isolation \n(Option B) is defined as: All parameter measurement with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as \nthe single source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the \nenergy conservation method affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the \nbaseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using \nmeasurements of proxies of energy use.\nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+/ - Routine adjustments  + /- Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 440, "chars": 2185, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_086_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_086_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:e354a62908ed64a82128da579635e079ec32cad86b4513e90437b492b03e0a91"}

A diagnostic examination of \nthe pilot equipment is implemented to determine if the unit’s operational conditions are satisfactory. \nBaseline measurements will be recorded and then the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® will be \ninjected. The product will be allowed 4 weeks to seat itself into the metal surfaces. At the end of this \ngestation period, Post M&V results were taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care \nto match the same or very similar entering air temperatures and compressor discharge pressures. These are \nthe two most critical measurements affected by the weather. Some units in this report required \nnormalization due to weather.\nIt was determined with Steve Cantrell of the Major Golf Organization HQ that the units run approximately 3,000 hours \nannually at a kWh cost of .1204 cents per kW. \nThe following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP International Performance Measurement and \nVerification Protocol as the M&V plan. Powertron Global’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer, Edward R. \n[Senior Energy Engineer], performed the final calculations and measurements.\nThe results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:\n \nkW= Volts X Amps * .9 / 1000 (single phase)\nBtuh Capacity = Measured CFM X 4.5 * Calculated Enthalpy Delta \nSystem Eﬃciency % = Actual Coil Capacity Btuh / Nominal Coil Capacity Btuh\nkW per Ton = Measured kW / Measured Tons\nCOP = 12 / kW per ton / 3.412\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\nEnergy Science Division\nMake\nModel  (outdoor/indoor unit)\nSerial    (outdoor/indoor unit)\nRefrigerant Type\nAge\nNominal Cooling Capacity Btuh \nTonnage\nAmerican Standard\n2A6B0060/TWE060\n5425UF52F/54851ELIV\n R-22\n 2005\n 60,000 Btuh\n 5\n       Detailed Results for Unit #1   \nSystem Description / Design Characteristics\nBaseline & Energy Reporting (Post) Periods\nThe baseline data was recorded on 6/20/13 using recently calibrated devices to insure measurement \naccuracy.
