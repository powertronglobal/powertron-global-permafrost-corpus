The post DB temperature (73 deg. F) entering the coil was matched to the baseline period (73 deg. F). After 
matching this temperature the post readings were taken to ensure that the work the coil had to do was as 
close as possible in the baseline. The post amperage was normalized due to the OAT being 4 degrees cooler 
in the post. Only 2 degrees or 2.33% (86 deg. F vs. 84 deg. F) adjustment upwards to the post amperage was 
implemented in the adjustment due to standard deviation of +/-2 degrees. Actual measured amps before 
adjustment for the outdoor unit was 21.8 amps.
