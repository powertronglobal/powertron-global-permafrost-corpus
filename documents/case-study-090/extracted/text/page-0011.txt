PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for Unit#1
Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for implementing 
the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to account for the amount of tonnage restored to 
the system. Once the percentage of improvement in capacity is determined, the kWh associated with the system in the 
Post is then reduced by the same percentage to account for the reduced number of hours the system will be required to 
run in the future to maintain the same set points. The average cost to operate the system prior to introduction of the 
ECM is then compared to the newly obtained cost to operate the system following the installation of the ECM to 
determine the estimated Payback Period for Major Golf Organization HQ Unit#2.  
Baseline kWh          1.74 kW * 3000 Annual Operating Hrs = 5,220 kWh
Cost to Run Baseline          5,220 kWh * $.1204 = $628.49
Post ECM kWh          1.39 kW * 3000 Annual Operating Hrs = 4,170 kWh
Revised kWh (based on 75.6% restored capacity)          4,170 kWh * (1 - .756) = 1,017 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Post          1,017 kWh * $.1204= $122.45
Avoided Energy Costs (Savings) Per Month          ($628.49- $122.45) / 12 = $42.17
Cost of ECM          $170
ROI          $170 / $42.17 = 4
   ROI = 4 months
