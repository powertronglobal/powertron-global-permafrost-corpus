PermaFrost NMR® Performance Report

Major Golf Organization HQ

June 30, 2013

Executive Summary

This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure

(ECM) PermaFrost NMR® for Major Golf Organization HQ located in Ponte Verde, FL. Detailed forensic performance

testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on 2 split system DX units.

Immediately following the baseline testing, the units were treated with the proper amount and type of

PermaFrost NMR® product formulated for R-22 DX systems. Since there were no other ECM’s going on

during this pilot project, the improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at the units is

solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. The units now provide cooler/drier supply air while

using less power. This greater operational efficiency is due to the restoration of the heat transfer ability of

the evaporator and condenser coils.

Following treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, the 2 units showed an average 35.9%

reduction in kW/ton based on the exact capacity measured in the baseline M&V and the post gestation

M&V. The units showed an average 50.9% reduction in kWh. Prior to the ECM, the units produced a total of

4.64 tons of cooling. After the ECM, the tonnage produced increased to 6.09 tons. This capacity increase

from the baseline performance level led to an effective net average increase in COP of 71.5%. All of these

factors directly correlate to what Major Golf Organization HQ building will realize in energy savings as they operate these

units in the future under the same parameters.

The result of the ECM improvements is a ROI to the customer of a matter of months. The tables of data and

financial calculations are available for review at the end of this report.

Product Brief

PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure

(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative® (NMR™) technology as its core agent. A sustainable,

one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type

of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVAC/R systems and equipment

that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); chilled water

systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia refrigeration plants

(single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The equipment utilized in

these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single and multi-stage), scroll,

reciprocating and screw configurations.

The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and

improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point temperatures in a more

rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from the

enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW hours

used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced carbon footprint for

the Major Golf Organization HQ.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol

The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) is utilized in the

development of this report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating,

Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization

(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation

methods and products.

There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They

are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Retrofit Isolation

(Option B) is defined as: All parameter measurement with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as

the single source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the

energy conservation method affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the

baseline data.

Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the

savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term

measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by

short-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using

measurements of proxies of energy use.

The final computation follows the formula:

Energy Science Division

Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy

+/ - Routine adjustments  + /- Non-Routine Adjustments

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content

The content of the following report will demonstrate the effects of PermaFrost NMR®’s ability to correct the

effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces.

It was determined with Major Golf Organization HQ to treat two small split system DX units. A diagnostic examination of

the pilot equipment is implemented to determine if the unit’s operational conditions are satisfactory.

Baseline measurements will be recorded and then the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® will be

injected. The product will be allowed 4 weeks to seat itself into the metal surfaces. At the end of this

gestation period, Post M&V results were taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care

to match the same or very similar entering air temperatures and compressor discharge pressures. These are

the two most critical measurements affected by the weather. Some units in this report required

normalization due to weather.

It was determined with Steve Cantrell of the Major Golf Organization HQ that the units run approximately 3,000 hours

annually at a kWh cost of .1204 cents per kW.

The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP International Performance Measurement and

Verification Protocol as the M&V plan. Powertron Global’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer, Edward R.

[Senior Energy Engineer], performed the final calculations and measurements.

The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:

kW= Volts X Amps * .9 / 1000 (single phase)

Btuh Capacity = Measured CFM X 4.5 * Calculated Enthalpy Delta

System Eﬃciency % = Actual Coil Capacity Btuh / Nominal Coil Capacity Btuh

kW per Ton = Measured kW / Measured Tons

COP = 12 / kW per ton / 3.412

The post DB temperature (73 deg. F) entering the coil was matched to the baseline period (73 deg. F). After

matching this temperature the post readings were taken to ensure that the work the coil had to do was as

close as possible in the baseline. The post amperage was normalized due to the OAT being 4 degrees cooler

in the post. Only 2 degrees or 2.33% (86 deg. F vs. 84 deg. F) adjustment upwards to the post amperage was

implemented in the adjustment due to standard deviation of +/-2 degrees. Actual measured amps before

adjustment for the outdoor unit was 21.8 amps.

PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for Unit#1

Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for implementing

the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to account for the amount of tonnage restored to

the system. Once the percentage of improvement in capacity is determined, the kWh associated with the system in the

Post is then reduced by the same percentage to account for the reduced number of hours the system will be required to

run in the future to maintain the same set points. The average cost to operate the system prior to introduction of the

ECM is then compared to the newly obtained cost to operate the system following the installation of the ECM to

determine the estimated Payback Period for Major Golf Organization HQ Unit#1.

Baseline kWh          6.06 kW * 3000 Annual Operating Hrs = 18,180 kWh

Cost to Run Baseline          18,180 kWh * $.1204 = $2,188.87

Post ECM kWh          5.74 kW * 3000 Annual Operating Hrs = 17,220 kWh

Revised kWh (based on 15.7% restored capacity)           17,220 kWh * (1 - .157) = 14,516 kWh

Revised Cost to Run Post          14,516 kWh * $.1204 = $1,747.73

Avoided Energy Costs (Savings) Per Month          ($2,188.87- $1,747.73) / 12 = $36.76

Cost of ECM          $425

ROI          $425 / $36.76= 11.6

ROI = 11.6 months
