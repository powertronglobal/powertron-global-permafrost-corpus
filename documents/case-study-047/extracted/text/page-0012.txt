Adjusted kW Baseline        .857 kW/ton * 24.06 tons = 20.62 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh        20.62 kW * 5,205 Annual Operating Hrs = 107,327 kWh  
Revised Cost to Run Baseline        107,327 kWh * $.09 = $9,659.43  
kW Post        .641 kW/ton * 24.06 tons = 15.42 kW  
Annual kWh Post         15.42 kW * 5,205 hours = 80,261 kWh  
Annual Cost Post         80,261 kWh * $.09 = $7,223.49  
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Month       ($9,659.43 – $7,223.49) /12 = $203  
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in each CRAC unit         $2,210.00
Estimated Energy Savings Payback Period for Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer         $2,210.00 / $203 = 10.9 months
*Note – A cost of $.09 per kWh was used for this [Texas Location] Pilot calculation. When using the national average kWh cost 
of $.105 the ROI will be 9.4 months
