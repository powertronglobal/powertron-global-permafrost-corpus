Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) was utilized in the 
development of this report. The Department of Energy (DOE), Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The 
American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency 
Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness 
of energy conservation measures and products.
There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They 
are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is 
defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM as the single source of 
measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM affected 
equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term 
measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by 
short-term measurements of baseline and avoided energy reporting period (AERP), and /or engineering 
computations using measurements of proxies of energy use. 
The final computation follows the formula:
