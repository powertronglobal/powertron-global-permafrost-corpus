Detailed Results for the Two Pilot CRAC’s
System Description / Design Characteristics
The two CRAC units provide cooling for the Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer’s mission-critical data center located in [Texas Location]. Based 
on the date of installation and total compressor runtime hours pulled directly from the system logs, the CRAC 
units run 5,205 hours per year prior to the ECM being implemented.  
Baseline & AERP Measurements
The identical IPMVP following data points were recorded for Baseline and AERP on 12/13/13 and 1/8/14 
respectively using recently NIST-calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. In all tests the discharge 
pressures of the compressors as well as the wet and dry bulb temperatures entering the coil were very similar 
in both periods so no adjustments to the data was necessary. Additionally, the CFM airflow readings taken in 
the baseline and AERP were within the 2% margin of error accepted so the same readings were used for both 
periods to ensure consistency of the data. The measurements are as follows:
