PermaFrost NMR® Eﬃciency Report
Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer
Legacy Rd Location, [Texas Location]
Report Summary
This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy conservation measure 
(ECM) PermaFrost NMR® into two computer room air conditioning (CRAC) units. The units (#3 and #5) 
are the same age (2001), same size (16.5 tons), use the same refrigerant (R22) and support the same 
mission-critical Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer data center housed within the Legacy Road facility in [Texas Location].
    
Following baseline detailed forensic performance measurement and verification (M&V) testing, each CRAC 
was treated with the proper amount and type of the PermaFrost NMR® technology specially formulated for 
these types of systems. After a gestation period of four weeks, identical testing was conducted under very 
similar conditions using the same test equipment as was used in the baseline.  The purpose of the testing 
was threefold:  
1. Demonstrate how the ECM improves the thermal performance 
2. Demonstrate ECM is safe and will not harm Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer’s critical HVAC equipment
3. Calculate the amount of energy saved per unit by restoring lost eﬃciency
 
Energy Science Division
This 16.5-ton Leibert CRAC unit was one of two units 
involved in the Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer pilot. These units help cool the 
mission-critical Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer internal data center in [Texas Location], 
TX.  The image shows several of the NIST-calibrated and 
certified digital instrumentation used to calculate the 
efficiency of each of the CRAC units in both the Baseline 
and Avoided Energy Reporting Period (AERP) or Post.

The improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at each CRAC was solely 
attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. This is a result of the successful removal of the accumulated 
excess lubricant layer on heat exchange surfaces.   
Following treatment with the ECM, CRAC units #3 and #5 showed a reduction in kW/ton of 24.3% and 
26.6% respectively based on the exact capacity measured in the baseline M&V and the post gestation 
M&V when operating at 100% load. The ECM also produced an increase cooling capacity of 21.9% and 
29% respectively equating to a total increase of 9.89 tons or an average of 4.95 tons per CRAC. This 
25.9% cooling capacity increase from the baseline performance levels led to an effective average increase 
in COP across the two CRAC’s of 34.7%.  Each of these factors directly correlate to what Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer will 
realize in energy savings as they operate these CRAC’s in the future, as well as other similar HVAC 
equipment across their portfolio.  
Following treatment, the two CRAC’s also showed a combined 25.9% increase in the Enthalpy Delta (i.e., 
amount of work done by the heat exchange coils) versus the Baseline. This is a critical measurement 
used to determine the thermodynamic enhancement brought about by the PermaFrost NMR®  ECM.  
The result of the ECM improvements is an ROI to Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer that is measured in less than one year. The 
tables of data used to determine the financial payback are available for review at the end of this report.
The charts on the following page visually capture the positive impact PermaFrost NMR® had on the 
average performance of the two pilot CRAC units.

Product Brief
PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure 
(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative® (NMR™) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, 
one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the rest of the useful life of 
system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and equipment 
that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); chilled water 
systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia refrigeration 
plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The equipment 
utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single and 
multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® in any type of HVACR system are improved cooling 
performance, increased capacity and improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to 
achieve set point temperatures in a more rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. 
The indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment 
include reduced run time, less kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life 
cycle time and a substantially reduced carbon footprint for Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer and their customers.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) was utilized in the 
development of this report. The Department of Energy (DOE), Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The 
American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency 
Valuation Organization (EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness 
of energy conservation measures and products.
There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They 
are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is 
defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM as the single source of 
measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM affected 
equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term 
measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by 
short-term measurements of baseline and avoided energy reporting period (AERP), and /or engineering 
computations using measurements of proxies of energy use. 
The final computation follows the formula:

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to remove the 
accumulated lubricant excess layer on the heat exchange surfaces. 
A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the operational 
conditions of the systems were satisfactory. Baseline M&V was recorded on each of the two CRAC units 
comprised of four (4) compressors and then the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected 
directly into the low pressure service port of the refrigerant loop. The gestation period for the Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer pilot 
was four weeks. 
Prior to taking AERP (i.e., post) measurements, systems need to achieve at least 300 or more hours of 
runtime to ensure adequate performance improvement. At the end of this gestation period, AERP 
measurements were taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same 
discharge pressures on the compressors as well as the wet bulb and dry bulb temperatures of the air 
entering the respective coils. These are three of the most critical variables to contend with in an in-situ 
HVAC testing situation. When analyzing all of the data in the baseline and AERP, the amps in the AERP 
period were adjusted downward per industry standards to account for the slightly warmer temperatures 
entering the condenser.
Wes Patterson, Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer’s building manager and Jerry Palacios, one of three HVAC service technicians 
supporting the facility, oversaw the testing on behalf of Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer. The final calculations were performed by 
Powertron Global®’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer] and signed off by Jerry Palacios.

Detailed Results for the Two Pilot CRAC’s
System Description / Design Characteristics
The two CRAC units provide cooling for the Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer’s mission-critical data center located in [Texas Location]. Based 
on the date of installation and total compressor runtime hours pulled directly from the system logs, the CRAC 
units run 5,205 hours per year prior to the ECM being implemented.  
Baseline & AERP Measurements
The identical IPMVP following data points were recorded for Baseline and AERP on 12/13/13 and 1/8/14 
respectively using recently NIST-calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. In all tests the discharge 
pressures of the compressors as well as the wet and dry bulb temperatures entering the coil were very similar 
in both periods so no adjustments to the data was necessary. Additionally, the CFM airflow readings taken in 
the baseline and AERP were within the 2% margin of error accepted so the same readings were used for both 
periods to ensure consistency of the data. The measurements are as follows:

Results
The following are the final calculated average performance measurement improvements following the 
PermaFrost NMR® AERP on the two Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer CRAC units.  
PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer
Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer for 
implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This greater capacity reduces the runtime hours and in turn 
reduces the annual kWh expended in the AERP. The true ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the 
system was when operating at its original energy profile then subtracting the cost to operate the system at its newly 
restored energy profile less the percentage of increased capacity. This regression calculation is the most scientific 
method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the units will now run due to their increased capacity which 
allows the units to reach set temperatures quicker and shut off sooner.   
Since this regression analysis involves two units, the average kW/ton and total tons are used to calculate an average 
ROI across the two units.
