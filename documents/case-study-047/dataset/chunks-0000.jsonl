The units (#3 and #5) \nare the same age (2001), same size (16.5 tons), use the same refrigerant (R22) and support the same \nmission-critical Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer data center housed within the Legacy Road facility in [Texas Location].\n    \nFollowing baseline detailed forensic performance measurement and verification (M&V) testing, each CRAC \nwas treated with the proper amount and type of the PermaFrost NMR® technology specially formulated for \nthese types of systems. After a gestation period of four weeks, identical testing was conducted under very \nsimilar conditions using the same test equipment as was used in the baseline.  The purpose of the testing \nwas threefold:  \n1. Demonstrate how the ECM improves the thermal performance \n2.

This is a result of the successful removal of the accumulated \nexcess lubricant layer on heat exchange surfaces.   \nFollowing treatment with the ECM, CRAC units #3 and #5 showed a reduction in kW/ton of 24.3% and \n26.6% respectively based on the exact capacity measured in the baseline M&V and the post gestation \nM&V when operating at 100% load. The ECM also produced an increase cooling capacity of 21.9% and \n29% respectively equating to a total increase of 9.89 tons or an average of 4.95 tons per CRAC. This \n25.9% cooling capacity increase from the baseline performance levels led to an effective average increase \nin COP across the two CRAC’s of 34.7%.  Each of these factors directly correlate to what Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer will \nrealize in energy savings as they operate these CRAC’s in the future, as well as other similar HVAC \nequipment across their portfolio.  \nFollowing treatment, the two CRAC’s also showed a combined 25.9% increase in the Enthalpy Delta (i.e., \namount of work done by the heat exchange coils) versus the Baseline. This is a critical measurement \nused to determine the thermodynamic enhancement brought about by the PermaFrost NMR®  ECM.  \nThe result of the ECM improvements is an ROI to Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer that is measured in less than one year. The \ntables of data used to determine the financial payback are available for review at the end of this report.\nThe charts on the following page visually capture the positive impact PermaFrost NMR® had on the \naverage performance of the two pilot CRAC units.  \nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 516, "chars": 2323, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_048_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_048_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:9fda3df98653827758e4e227c470e5372ec0d54e1b4eedcc641bdac3d203db8f"}

A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the rest of the useful life of \nsystem in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and equipment \nthat PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); chilled water \nsystems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia refrigeration \nplants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The equipment \nutilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single and \nmulti-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® in any type of HVACR system are improved cooling \nperformance, increased capacity and improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to \nachieve set point temperatures in a more rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. \nThe indirect benefits resulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment \ninclude reduced run time, less kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life \ncycle time and a substantially reduced carbon footprint for Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer and their customers.\nEnergy Science Division\nBOUNDARY LAYER\nOIL REMOVED\nBEFORE TREATMENT\nAFTER TREATMENT\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website.", "tokens": 799, "chars": 3154, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_048_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_048_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:664fcdd278a3b207cae5db82e078a5860b1ed3912e9a8ca0a524f05d4ffdc95c"}

Option B is \ndefined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM as the single source of \nmeasurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM affected \nequipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and avoided energy reporting period (AERP), and /or engineering \ncomputations using measurements of proxies of energy use. \nThe final computation follows the formula:\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 496, "chars": 2454, "pages": {"start": 5, "end": 6}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_048_chunk_0003", "next_id": "pdf_048_chunk_0005", "content_hash": "sha256:deb896dafa05d52e13b7c929cd686e60fc2d45c8408ff380ce5f93a122c6628d"}

Baseline M&V was recorded on each of the two CRAC units \ncomprised of four (4) compressors and then the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected \ndirectly into the low pressure service port of the refrigerant loop. The gestation period for the Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer pilot \nwas four weeks. \nPrior to taking AERP (i.e., post) measurements, systems need to achieve at least 300 or more hours of \nruntime to ensure adequate performance improvement. At the end of this gestation period, AERP \nmeasurements were taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same \ndischarge pressures on the compressors as well as the wet bulb and dry bulb temperatures of the air \nentering the respective coils. These are three of the most critical variables to contend with in an in-situ \nHVAC testing situation. When analyzing all of the data in the baseline and AERP, the amps in the AERP \nperiod were adjusted downward per industry standards to account for the slightly warmer temperatures \nentering the condenser.\nWes Patterson, Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer’s building manager and Jerry Palacios, one of three HVAC service technicians \nsupporting the facility, oversaw the testing on behalf of Global Telecom Equipment Manufacturer. The final calculations were performed by \nPowertron Global®’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer] and signed off by Jerry Palacios. \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\nEnergy Science Division\nSamples of Key Measurements\nThe results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:\n \nkW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) \n \nBTUH = CFM * 4.5 * Wet Bulb Enthalpy Delta\n \nkW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage\n \nPercentage Eﬃciency = Measured BTUH / Manufacturers Design BTUH\n \nCoeﬃcient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 691, "chars": 3154, "pages": {"start": 6, "end": 8}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_048_chunk_0004", "next_id": "pdf_048_chunk_0006", "content_hash": "sha256:a4ffd4da965421e65eb1b13d66092db457e58693913b5b632a9d36452ad5fe30"}
