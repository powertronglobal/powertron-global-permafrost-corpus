Method of Procedure for testing: 
 
 
The objective of measuring the overall cooling production of HVAC/R systems can 
be realized by measuring the total energy consumed by the specific unit being 
tested and the total BTUH production of the system then calculating these 
parameters to obtain current capacity, kW/ton, EER (energy efficient ratio) and 
COP (coefficient of performance). Using that information the total BTUH of 
cooling production can be realized.  
 
The objective of measuring overall power consumed by an HVAC/R system can 
be realized by measuring voltage, amperage and power factor.
