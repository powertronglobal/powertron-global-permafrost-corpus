For these HVAC/R systems, parameters were measured continuously every 
second during all hours for a period of seven (7) days to develop a scientific 
baseline. The same exact parameters were measured for the post data collection 
period. 
 
The outdoor air temperature entering the air-cooled condenser coils of each unit 
will affect the design capacity. An analysis is provided for each of the seven (7) 
day periods (baseline & post) of performance profiles of subsequent kW/ton, EER 
and COP across a variation of outdoor air temperatures spanning a twenty-five 
(25) degree span (75ºF-100ºF). 
 
Total BTUH was developed along with total kW consumption by measuring all 
required data points (33 points - see appendix for points measured) and entering 
them into industry best practice engineering formulae. All measurement hardware 
was certified under NIST or CE standards. Engineering formulae was developed 
by AHRI / ASHRAE (American Heating and Refrigeration Institute / American 
Society of Heating Refrigeration & Air Conditioning Engineers): 
 
 
Kilo-watt (kW) = Volts (V) x Amps (A) x Power Factor (PF) x √3 / 1000 
British Thermal Units (BTU) = CFM x 4.5 x Enthalpy Delta  
Capacity / Tons = BTU / 12,000 
Kilo-watt per Ton (kW/Ton) = kW Energy / Tons (capacity) 
Co-Efficient of Performance (COP) = 12/kW per ton/ 3.412 
Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) = BTU / Watts
