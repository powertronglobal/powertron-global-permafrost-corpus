To Determine Capacity: 
 
 
The entering evaporator air volume, dry bulb temperature and enthalpy are 
measured by the CFM and inlet temperature/enthalpy sensors. The evaporator 
leaving air temperature and enthalpy are measured by the outlet air temperature 
enthalpy sensor. The inlet and outlet enthalpies are subtracted from each other 
resulting in a sum called the Enthalpy delta. This enthalpy delta (∆) is used in the 
shown formula below. Other components of this formula complete the equation. 
These include the volume of air passing through the evaporator (CFM or Cubic feet 
of air per minute) and an engineering standard ratio of 4.5 (Ratio of Standard Air) 
or constant.  The result of this calculation yields the industry standard the British 
Thermal Unit (BTU), which is used to calculate the unit’s capacity in BTU. This BTU 
number is then divided by the constant 12,000 which is to convert to refrigeration 
tons because every 12,000 BTUs equals 1 Ton of HVAC capacity. The capacity 
formula is: 
 
 
CFM x 4.5 x Enthalpy ∆ = BTUs / 12,000 = Tons (capacity) 
 
 
CFM – Cubic Feet per Minute of Air Flow or Air Volume 
4.5 – Ratio of Standard Air (constant)
