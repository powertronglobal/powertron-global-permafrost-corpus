Enthalpy ∆ - Enthalpy Delta of the Inlet – Outlet Enthalpy 
BTU – British Thermal Units  
12,000 – every 12,000 BTUs equals 1 Ton (constant) 
 
 
 
Example 
 
4000 (CFM) X 4.5 (Standard Air Ratio) X 8 (Enthalpy Delta) = 144,000 BTU, then 
divide by 12,000 = 12 tons 
 
 
To Determine Electrical Energy Consumption: 
 
Total electrical consumption is measured at the main source of electric service of 
each rooftop unit. This includes, voltage, amperage and power factor and a 
constant of the square root of 3 (√3). This is then divided by 1000 to obtain 
kilowatts. The electrical formula for kilowatt (kW) is: 
 
kW = V x A x PF x √3 / 1000 
 
V – Voltage 
A – Amperage 
PF – Power Factor 
√3 – Square Root of 3 for 3-phase Input Power 
1000 – constant  
 
 
Example 
 
480 (volts) X 45 (amps) X √3 (phase angle for three phase power only) X 0.90 
(power factor) / 1000 = 33.67 kilowatts  
 
 
 
To Determine Efficiency: 
 
Divide the measured kilowatts (kW) by the measured tons to obtain kW per ton. kW 
per ton is the industry standard to determine system efficiency.  
 
Example 
 
33.67 kW / 12 tons = 2.80 kilowatts per ton
