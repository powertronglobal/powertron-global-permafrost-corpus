INTRODUCTION

Baseline monitoring was performed from July 8 - 14 at the San Antonio, TX 
location, to verify the current energy efficiency of fourteen (14) DX systems using 
Powertron Global’s FMV platform in conjunction with F2 devices utilizing the latest 
in the Internet of Things (IoT) cloud based reporting. This confirmatory testing 
scenario was designed to give Retail Chain C a full review into the efficiency gains 
and performance provided by Powertron Global’s Enhanced Preventative 
Maintenance (EPM) service on one entire store. Post data was captured on 
September 12-18, 2020 after enough gestation time was captured for most of the 
units located at this site. Detailed performance analysis for each unit can be found 
in this report. All HVAC/R pieces of equipment that service this location are being 
monitored. The HVAC/R equipment information can be found below:

The confirmatory testing is designed to monitor the operation of any system, 
before and after installation of PermaFrost NMR® and the Multi-Enzyme exterior 
coil cleaning, to verify the amount of capacity restored and current kW/ton energy 
savings improvement.  
 
The monitoring isolates the entry and departure points of the medium being 
cooled and the power being used. By recording the conditions at those entry and 
departure points the overall cooling results can be compared to the overall power 
consumed to quantify the power costs per unit of cooling kW/Ton (kilowatt-per-
ton), EER (Energy Efficiency Ratio), COP (Co-Efficient of Performance), Total 
Capacity & Enthalpy Delta T. 
 
 
Notes: 
 
RTU 8 & RTU 9 & unfortunately did not run enough to meet the required gestation 
time (~500 hours per circuit) in order for PermaFrost NMR to fully seat into the 
metal surfaces of the refrigeration circuits. No results were available for the post-
reporting period. 
 
RTU 13 had all of it’s gestation time was met in compressor 1(circuit 1) but not in 
the other two compressors/circuits. As mentioned in the baseline report submitted 
on July 22, 2020, RTU 13 is equipped with 3 compressors however the primary 
compressor that is used is compressor 1. This compressor does work in 
conjunction with compressor 2 on occasion throughout a given seven-day period. 
This compressor is rated at 6 tons but only outputting an average of .37 tons. We 
recommend this unit being serviced AFTER the testing is completed. Compressor 
3 is never energized. It was determined to use the data set when compressor 1 & 
2 were energized. No usable post data was available. 
 
These three units were omitted form the results summary and appendix sections.

Method of Procedure for testing:

The objective of measuring the overall cooling production of HVAC/R systems can 
be realized by measuring the total energy consumed by the specific unit being 
tested and the total BTUH production of the system then calculating these 
parameters to obtain current capacity, kW/ton, EER (energy efficient ratio) and 
COP (coefficient of performance). Using that information the total BTUH of 
cooling production can be realized.  
 
The objective of measuring overall power consumed by an HVAC/R system can 
be realized by measuring voltage, amperage and power factor.

For these HVAC/R systems, parameters were measured continuously every 
second during all hours for a period of seven (7) days to develop a scientific 
baseline. The same exact parameters were measured for the post data collection 
period. 
 
The outdoor air temperature entering the air-cooled condenser coils of each unit 
will affect the design capacity. An analysis is provided for each of the seven (7) 
day periods (baseline & post) of performance profiles of subsequent kW/ton, EER 
and COP across a variation of outdoor air temperatures spanning a twenty-five 
(25) degree span (75ºF-100ºF). 
 
Total BTUH was developed along with total kW consumption by measuring all 
required data points (33 points - see appendix for points measured) and entering 
them into industry best practice engineering formulae. All measurement hardware 
was certified under NIST or CE standards. Engineering formulae was developed 
by AHRI / ASHRAE (American Heating and Refrigeration Institute / American 
Society of Heating Refrigeration & Air Conditioning Engineers):

Kilo-watt (kW) = Volts (V) x Amps (A) x Power Factor (PF) x √3 / 1000

British Thermal Units (BTU) = CFM x 4.5 x Enthalpy Delta

Capacity / Tons = BTU / 12,000

Kilo-watt per Ton (kW/Ton) = kW Energy / Tons (capacity)

Co-Efficient of Performance (COP) = 12/kW per ton/ 3.412

Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) = BTU / Watts

To Determine Capacity: 
 
 
The entering evaporator air volume, dry bulb temperature and enthalpy are 
measured by the CFM and inlet temperature/enthalpy sensors. The evaporator 
leaving air temperature and enthalpy are measured by the outlet air temperature 
enthalpy sensor. The inlet and outlet enthalpies are subtracted from each other 
resulting in a sum called the Enthalpy delta. This enthalpy delta (∆) is used in the 
shown formula below. Other components of this formula complete the equation. 
These include the volume of air passing through the evaporator (CFM or Cubic feet 
of air per minute) and an engineering standard ratio of 4.5 (Ratio of Standard Air) 
or constant.  The result of this calculation yields the industry standard the British 
Thermal Unit (BTU), which is used to calculate the unit’s capacity in BTU. This BTU 
number is then divided by the constant 12,000 which is to convert to refrigeration 
tons because every 12,000 BTUs equals 1 Ton of HVAC capacity. The capacity 
formula is: 
 
 
CFM x 4.5 x Enthalpy ∆ = BTUs / 12,000 = Tons (capacity) 
 
 
CFM – Cubic Feet per Minute of Air Flow or Air Volume 
4.5 – Ratio of Standard Air (constant)

Enthalpy ∆ - Enthalpy Delta of the Inlet – Outlet Enthalpy 
BTU – British Thermal Units  
12,000 – every 12,000 BTUs equals 1 Ton (constant) 
 
 
 
Example 
 
4000 (CFM) X 4.5 (Standard Air Ratio) X 8 (Enthalpy Delta) = 144,000 BTU, then 
divide by 12,000 = 12 tons

To Determine Electrical Energy Consumption: 
 
Total electrical consumption is measured at the main source of electric service of 
each rooftop unit. This includes, voltage, amperage and power factor and a 
constant of the square root of 3 (√3). This is then divided by 1000 to obtain 
kilowatts. The electrical formula for kilowatt (kW) is:

kW = V x A x PF x √3 / 1000 
 
V – Voltage 
A – Amperage 
PF – Power Factor 
√3 – Square Root of 3 for 3-phase Input Power 
1000 – constant  
 
 
Example 
 
480 (volts) X 45 (amps) X √3 (phase angle for three phase power only) X 0.90 
(power factor) / 1000 = 33.67 kilowatts

To Determine Efficiency: 
 
Divide the measured kilowatts (kW) by the measured tons to obtain kW per ton. kW 
per ton is the industry standard to determine system efficiency.

Example

33.67 kW / 12 tons = 2.80 kilowatts per ton

Technical

When PermaFrost NMR® (interior coil surface treatment) is installed into a unit, a 
molecular transformation develops. This transformation displaces layers of 
lubricating fluids that have been impinged in the evaporator and condenser heat 
exchanger metal surfaces. When the fluid is displaced, the evaporator and 
condenser can transfer additional heat energy through the tube walls (thermal 
restoration). This enables the evaporator to completely dehumidify the air per the  
 
unit’s design specifications.  When more dehumidification is developed, the 
enthalpy (a measure of how many grains of moisture are contained in a pound of 
air) increases. 
 
If the CFM and 4.5 remain constant, then it is the effect of PermaFrost NMR®’s 
Enthalpy Delta increase that restores (increases) the lost capacity (Tons).  
 
If the tonnage increases, then the kW/ton decreases by means of mathematical 
function, demonstrating PermaFrost NMR®’s post-treatment effect lowering the 
electrical cost of every ton of cooling produced, no matter how many tons are 
called for at any given time.  
  
PermaFrost NMR® cannot change any unit’s electrical characteristics i.e. 
everything that requires electricity is rated for the required power under different 
loads e.g. compressors and fans.  
 
The multi-enzyme evaporator coil cleaner (exterior surface treatment) is designed 
for the removal of organic and inorganic debris (biofilm) from the heat exchangers 
to improve efficiency, reduces running costs while improving indoor air quality. The 
proprietary enzyme based cleaner is non corrosive and completely biodegradable.

A common form of fouling (exterior surface) arises from the formation of bacteria 
and fungi deep inside the coils. This biological form of fouling is exceptionally 
problematic for HVAC systems. When microbes take root deep inside the coils they 
begin to form biofilms, which is a plasticity type of membrane excreted by these 
micro-organisms. Biofilms are particularly detrimental to the HVAC system because 
these films are highly conductive which works to inhibit heat transfer between the 
metal surfaces of the coil and the passing air flow. In addition, biofilms can have 
sticky surfaces that can accumulate dust and the other fouling debris, thereby 
acting to inhibit air flow and efficient heat transfer though the coils.

Conclusion 
 
 
The Retail Chain C DX units' confirmatory testing results validate the performance 
improvements of the treated HVAC/R system and are in line with a previously 
tested UL (formally Underwriters Laboratories) unit as well as +300 P.E. reviewed 
case studies available upon request.  The results of the confirmatory testing 
demonstrate the efficacy of PermaFrost NMR® by restoring the evaporator and 
condenser heat transfer capabilities per manufacturer’s design, thereby restoring 
cooling capacity while lowering the electrical cost per ton of cooling.
