Detailed forensic \nperformance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on this package RTU using R22 as the \nrefrigerant.  Following testing, the RTU was treated with the proper amount and type of the PermaFrost \nNMR® technology specially formulated for these types of systems.  Measurement and Verification (M&V) \nwas conducted pre-installation and post-gestation. The purpose of the testing was to 1) show how the ECM \nimproves the thermal performance of any system it is installed in, and 2) show that the ECM is safe and will \nnot harm Major University’s HVAC equipment.\nThe improvement in efficiency and restored capacity \ngained directly at the unit was solely attributable to \nthe PermaFrost NMR® ECM. This is a result of the \nreversal of thermal inefficiency on heat exchange surfaces.  \nFollowing treatment with the ECM, the packaged \nRTU showed an effective net 21.4% reduction in \nkW/ton based on the exact capacity measured in the \nbaseline M&V and the post gestation M&V when \noperating at 100% load. The ECM also produced an \naverage increase cooling capacity of 24% or 5.79 \ntons. Prior to the ECM, the system produced 24.17 \ntons of cooling as measured in-situ. After the ECM, \nthe average combined tonnage produced increased \nto 29.96 tons. This 24% cooling capacity increase from the baseline performance levels led to an effective \naverage increase in COP of 27.1% and a calculated reduction in kWh of 26% All of these factors directly \ncorrelate to what Major University University (part of University A) will realize in energy savings as they operate this \npackage RTU in the future as well as other similar HVAC equipment across their portfolio.\nThis 30-ton Mammoth package RTU involved in the Major University \nUniversity A pilot supports the medical labs and management offices \nwithin Duchess Hall on the South Campus of the University.  The \nimage shows several of the certified digital instrumentation used to \ncalculate the efficiency of the RTU in both the Baseline and Post.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 722, "chars": 3241, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_098_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:d0d258f882992baaa7975fd2614016496241c949906e57ccd957cb5ea8a67b05"}

A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for at least 10 years in any type of \nsystem in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and equipment that \nPermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); chilled water systems \n(both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia refrigeration plants (single \ncompressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The equipment utilized in these \nsystems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single and multi-stage), scroll, \nreciprocating and screw configurations.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® in any type of HVACR system are improved cooling performance, \nincreased capacity and improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point \ntemperatures in a more rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits \nresulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, \nless kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced \ncarbon footprint for Major University University and the rest of University A too.\nEnergy Science Division\nBOUNDARY LAYER\nOIL REMOVED\nBEFORE TREATMENT\nAFTER TREATMENT\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 655, "chars": 3092, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_098_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_098_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:f49cba43c20fe366655f1ae1738de3e1e941e584ab0feccb6c9a41a0d9f3f5a5"}

Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM affected \nequipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained.

Baseline M&V was recorded on the supporting compressor and \nthen the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected. The gestation period for the Stony \nBrook University pilot was 9 weeks. Prior to taking Post measurements, systems need to achieve at least 300 \nor more hours of runtime to ensure adequate performance improvement time. At the end of this gestation \nperiod, Post M&V results were taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match \nthe same or very similar entering air wet bulb and dry bulb as well as compressor discharge pressures. \nThese are three of the most critical variables to contend with in an in-situ HVAC testing situation. When \nanalyzing all of the data baseline and post data, the post Amps were adjusted upwards slightly to \ncompensate for the 5 degree cooler outdoor air temps in the post testing period.\n  \nThe following report produces the utilization of the International Performance Measurement and \nVerification Protocol (IPMVP) as the M&V plan.

This greater capacity reduces the runtime hours and in turn \nreduces the annual kWh expended in the Post.
