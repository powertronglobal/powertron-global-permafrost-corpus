PermaFrost NMR® Eﬃciency Report
Major University University   
September, 2013 
Executive Summary
         This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure (ECM) 
PermaFrost NMR® into a 30-ton Mammoth package roof top unit (RTU) supporting the medical labs and 
offices within Duchess Hall on the South Campus of Major University University, NY.  Detailed forensic 
performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on this package RTU using R22 as the 
refrigerant.  Following testing, the RTU was treated with the proper amount and type of the PermaFrost 
NMR® technology specially formulated for these types of systems.  Measurement and Verification (M&V) 
was conducted pre-installation and post-gestation. The purpose of the testing was to 1) show how the ECM 
improves the thermal performance of any system it is installed in, and 2) show that the ECM is safe and will 
not harm Major University’s HVAC equipment.
The improvement in efficiency and restored capacity 
gained directly at the unit was solely attributable to 
the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. This is a result of the 
reversal of thermal inefficiency on heat exchange surfaces.  
Following treatment with the ECM, the packaged 
RTU showed an effective net 21.4% reduction in 
kW/ton based on the exact capacity measured in the 
baseline M&V and the post gestation M&V when 
operating at 100% load. The ECM also produced an 
average increase cooling capacity of 24% or 5.79 
tons. Prior to the ECM, the system produced 24.17 
tons of cooling as measured in-situ. After the ECM, 
the average combined tonnage produced increased 
to 29.96 tons. This 24% cooling capacity increase from the baseline performance levels led to an effective 
average increase in COP of 27.1% and a calculated reduction in kWh of 26% All of these factors directly 
correlate to what Major University University (part of University A) will realize in energy savings as they operate this 
package RTU in the future as well as other similar HVAC equipment across their portfolio.
This 30-ton Mammoth package RTU involved in the Major University 
University A pilot supports the medical labs and management offices 
within Duchess Hall on the South Campus of the University.  The 
image shows several of the certified digital instrumentation used to 
calculate the efficiency of the RTU in both the Baseline and Post.

Following treatment the system also showed a 24.6% increase in the Enthalpy Delta across the coil versus 
the Baseline, which is a critical measurement used to determine the thermodynamic enhancement brought 
about by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result of the ECM improvement is an ROI to Major University that is 
measured in a months. The tables of data used to determine the financial payback are available for review at 
the end of this report.

Product Brief
         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure 
(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative® (NMR™) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, 
one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for at least 10 years in any type of 
system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and equipment that 
PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); chilled water systems 
(both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia refrigeration plants (single 
compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The equipment utilized in these 
systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single and multi-stage), scroll, 
reciprocating and screw configurations.
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® in any type of HVACR system are improved cooling performance, 
increased capacity and improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point 
temperatures in a more rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits 
resulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, 
less kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced 
carbon footprint for Major University University and the rest of University A too.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) was utilized in the 
development of this report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating, 
Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization 
(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation 
methods and products.
There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They 
are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is 
defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM as the single source of 
measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM affected 
equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term 
measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by 
short-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations 
using measurements of proxies of energy use. 
The final computation follows the formula:

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces. 
A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the operational 
conditions of the system was satisfactory. Baseline M&V was recorded on the supporting compressor and 
then the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected. The gestation period for the Stony 
Brook University pilot was 9 weeks. Prior to taking Post measurements, systems need to achieve at least 300 
or more hours of runtime to ensure adequate performance improvement time. At the end of this gestation 
period, Post M&V results were taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match 
the same or very similar entering air wet bulb and dry bulb as well as compressor discharge pressures. 
These are three of the most critical variables to contend with in an in-situ HVAC testing situation. When 
analyzing all of the data baseline and post data, the post Amps were adjusted upwards slightly to 
compensate for the 5 degree cooler outdoor air temps in the post testing period.
  
The following report produces the utilization of the International Performance Measurement and 
Verification Protocol (IPMVP) as the M&V plan. [Director of Facilities Maintenance], Director of Facilities Maintenance for Stony 
Brook University sanctioned this pilot. The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global®’s 
Forensic Mechanical Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer].   
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
BTUH = CFM * 4.5 * Wet Bulb Enthalpy Delta
 
kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage
 
Percentage Eﬃciency = Measured BTUH / Manufacturers Design BTUH
 
Coeﬃcient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)

       Detailed Results for 30-Ton Package RTU
System Description / Design Characteristics
This system provides cooling for the Duchess Hall facility located on Major University University’s south 
campus. Given the internal load of the facility and national weather BIN data, it is estimated that the system 
runs ~2,950 hours per year prior to the ECM being implemented.  
Baseline & Energy Reporting (Post) Periods
The identical IPMVP following data points were recorded for Baseline and Post on 6/26/13 and 9/5/13 
respectively using recently NIST calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. The return wet and 
dry bulb temperatures entering the coil were very similar in both periods as were the discharge pressures of 
the compressor so only the post Amps were adjusted upwards slightly to compensate for the 5 degree 
cooler outdoor air temps in the post testing period.  Both original and adjusted post amps are shown in the 
table below. The measurements are as follows:

PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for Major University University
Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Major University 
for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This greater capacity reduces the runtime hours and in turn 
reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post. The true ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the system 
was when operating at its original energy profile then subtracting the cost to operate the system at its newly restored 
energy profile less the percentage of increased capacity. This regression calculation is the most scientific method of 
accounting for the reduced number of hours the units will now run due to their increased capacity which allows the 
units to reach set temperatures quicker and shut off sooner.   
Baseline kWh        40.49 kW * 2,950 Annual Operating Hrs = 119,435 kWh
Cost to Run Baseline        119,435 kWh * $.105 = $12,540.68
Post ECM kWh        39.42 kW * 2,950 Annual Operating Hrs = 116,289 kWh
Revised kWh (based on 24% restored capacity)        116,298 kWh * (1 - .24) = 88,380 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Post        88,380 kWh * $.105 = $9,279.90
Avoided Energy Costs (Savings) Per Month        ($12,540.68 - $9,279.90) / 12 = $271.73
Cost of ECM        $3,450
ROI        $3,450 / $271.73 = 12.7 
 
 ROI = 13 months
*Note – A cost of $.105 per kWh was used for this south campus calculation. If the true cost is above this amount then 
the ROI will be even less.
