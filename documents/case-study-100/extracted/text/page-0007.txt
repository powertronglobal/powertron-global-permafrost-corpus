System Description / Design Characteristics
This system provides cooling for the Duchess Hall facility located on Major University University’s south 
campus. Given the internal load of the facility and national weather BIN data, it is estimated that the system 
runs ~2,950 hours per year prior to the ECM being implemented.  
Baseline & Energy Reporting (Post) Periods
The identical IPMVP following data points were recorded for Baseline and Post on 6/26/13 and 9/5/13 
respectively using recently NIST calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. The return wet and 
dry bulb temperatures entering the coil were very similar in both periods as were the discharge pressures of 
the compressor so only the post Amps were adjusted upwards slightly to compensate for the 5 degree 
cooler outdoor air temps in the post testing period.  Both original and adjusted post amps are shown in the 
table below. The measurements are as follows:
