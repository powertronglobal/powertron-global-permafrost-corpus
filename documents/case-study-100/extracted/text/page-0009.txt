PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for Major University University
Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Major University 
for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This greater capacity reduces the runtime hours and in turn 
reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post. The true ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the system 
was when operating at its original energy profile then subtracting the cost to operate the system at its newly restored 
energy profile less the percentage of increased capacity. This regression calculation is the most scientific method of 
accounting for the reduced number of hours the units will now run due to their increased capacity which allows the 
units to reach set temperatures quicker and shut off sooner.   
Baseline kWh        40.49 kW * 2,950 Annual Operating Hrs = 119,435 kWh
Cost to Run Baseline        119,435 kWh * $.105 = $12,540.68
Post ECM kWh        39.42 kW * 2,950 Annual Operating Hrs = 116,289 kWh
Revised kWh (based on 24% restored capacity)        116,298 kWh * (1 - .24) = 88,380 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Post        88,380 kWh * $.105 = $9,279.90
Avoided Energy Costs (Savings) Per Month        ($12,540.68 - $9,279.90) / 12 = $271.73
Cost of ECM        $3,450
ROI        $3,450 / $271.73 = 12.7 
 
 ROI = 13 months
*Note – A cost of $.105 per kWh was used for this south campus calculation. If the true cost is above this amount then 
the ROI will be even less.
