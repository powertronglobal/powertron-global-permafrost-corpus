Following treatment the system also showed a 24.6% increase in the Enthalpy Delta across the coil versus 
the Baseline, which is a critical measurement used to determine the thermodynamic enhancement brought 
about by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result of the ECM improvement is an ROI to Major University that is 
measured in a months. The tables of data used to determine the financial payback are available for review at 
the end of this report.
