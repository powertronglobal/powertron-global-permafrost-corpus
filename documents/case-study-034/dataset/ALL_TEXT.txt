HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report
Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study
Thermal degradation is well documented by the American Society of 
Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) and 
the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). It is a major cause of 
capacity loss in Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and 
Refrigeration (HVACR) systems, preventing them from operating at the 
original design efficiency. 
The purpose of this efficiency study is to verify the effectiveness of the 
PermaFrost NMR® Energy Conservation Measure (ECM) in Major US Warehouse Retailer’s 
refrigeration systems and document the future energy cost reductions 
associated with the same.

Rack-A was forensically tested using the IPMVP methodology to determine the low and 
medium compressor performance capabilities before and after the implementation of the 
PermaFrost ECM. Rack-B was also treated so store’s power bill would reflect reduction 
resulting from total refrigeration improvement. Images below left are of the awards the 
Clima-Check performance analyzer has won in the field of thermal dynamic improvement 
monitoring. Image directly below is of the Clima-Check performance analyzer itself.

Process
This comprehensive report contains specific information regarding the performance profile of the low and 
medium temperature compressors comprising Rack-A which supports the Major US Warehouse Retailer facility in [Florida Location]. 
For this report, detailed performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on each half of Rack 
A before (baseline) and after (post) the installation of the ECM. The data was collected using the Clima-Check 
performance analyzer. This testing determined the impact on three key elements relating to the operational 
performance of the systems prior to the ECM that greatly affect the refrigeration portion of Major US Warehouse Retailer’s power bill. 
They include:
 
1. The cooling capacity required of Rack-A to reach evaporator set points after 11 years in service. 
 
2. The amount of kWh’s used to achieve similar evaporator set points in baseline and post periods. 
 
3. The thermal dynamic ability of the equipment to still perform at or close to operational design.  
Methodology
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the 
IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. [Technical Specialist] and [Technical Specialist], 
working in direct coordination with Clima-Check of Sweden, remotely collected and verified all of the pilot 
refrigeration measurements. All of the temperature and pressure sensors were installed with support from 
Refrigeration Contractor A, Major US Warehouse Retailer’s refrigeration support contractor.  
The Clima-Check performance analyzer is specifically designed to monitor thermal dynamic and power efficiency 
performance improvement in all types of HVAC and refrigeration systems instantaneously and over time. 
For this pilot, ten days of data was collected prior to Rack-A being treated with the PermaFrost NMR® ECM 
on 10 May 2014. The ECM was then allowed to work for a period of at least 400+ hours before any post 
collection data was compared to the baseline data. 
 
To reduce the impact the store and weather variables may have on the data, two similar periods of time with 
similar outside air temperatures and time of day were chosen to compare refrigeration performance before 
and after the ECM. These comparisons included:
Tuesday 8 April (75.5°) & Tuesday 29 April (77.2°), 1AM – 5AM (no activity in store)
Monday 7 April (79.3°) & Monday 5 May (80.6°), 10AM – 9PM (full day of operations)
The boundary of the testing was the low and medium temperature compressors and nothing else; therefore 
the performance calculations are extremely accurate.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the low and medium temperature 
portions of Rack-A to perform prior to PermaFrost NMR® (ECM) being installed, as well as illustrate the 
amount of thermal degradation within the heat exchangers. 
Following a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to determine the operational condition of the 
systems was satisfactory, Baseline M&V data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. Approximately 
five weeks after installation of PermaFrost NMR®, the M&V team returned to uninstall all the monitoring 
equipment after verifying with Clima-Check that the data taken during the pilot was satisfactory. The delta of 
these combination of measurements and associated calculations show the amount improvement the 
PermaFrost NMR® had on Rack-A.
The following report was produced utilizing the IPMVP framework as the M&V plan.
The results were tracked by the Clima-Check Performance Analyzer either directly or formulated by 
entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
• kWh= kW * Runtime Hours
 
• Thermal Transfer Delta T = Evap Temp Leaving – Returning Refrigerant Temp
 
• Amps = direct collection showing amount of work the compressor is doing
 
• kW = (Volts * Amps * Power Factor * √3) / 1000

Refrigeration Eﬃciency Study Results
Calculated Eﬃciency of Major US Warehouse Retailer Refrigeration Baseline and Post
The charts below illustrate where the energy savings achieved in this pilot are stemming from. The average 
tonnage required to achieve the multiple low and medium evaporator set points has been reduced from 30.75 
in each section of Rack-A down to 28.65. This equates to a reduction of 6.83%. The overall annual kWh’s 
associated with the operation of Rack-A dropped 6.63%, from 1,486,660 kWh in the baseline to 1,388,032 in the 
post.  Given nearly identical voltage recorded in both the baseline and post measurement periods, the average 
Amps used by the compressors to reach given evaporator set points dropped from 208.4 down to 195.2, equating 
to 6.33%. Finally, the calculated kW/ton dropped from 2.76 to 2.58 which equates to a reduction of 6.52%.
The key system improvements have come by way of thermal dynamic efficiency improvement, which 
demonstrates how much heat is being absorbed in the cooling cycle. In particular, the delta of the leaving 
refrigerant temperature at the compressor and the refrigerant temperature returning from the evaporators.  For 
Rack-A, the refrigerant delta in the baseline averaged 39.3 degrees and increased to 42.08 degrees in the post. 
This equates to an increase in the thermal transfer ability of Rack-A of 7.1%

Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period 
for Major US Warehouse Retailer for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true 
energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended 
in the Avoided Energy Reporting (Post) Analysis Period. In this case, where less tonnage is now required to achieve 
evaporator set points, the ROI first comes from determining what the cost to run Rack-A was when operating at the 
original energy profile. To account for the reduced amount of tonnage now needed to achieve set points, the original 
tonnage is used in the formulation of the post kW/ton rating. This post kW/ton rating is then used in conjunction with 
the original tonnage and the actual kW produced by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. The result directly correlates with 
the other savings achieved by the ECM. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for 
the reduced number of hours the systems will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows 
the systems to reach the internal evaporator set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor 
demand loading.
