The data was collected using the Clima-Check \nperformance analyzer. This testing determined the impact on three key elements relating to the operational \nperformance of the systems prior to the ECM that greatly affect the refrigeration portion of Major US Warehouse Retailer’s power bill. \nThey include:\n \n1. The cooling capacity required of Rack-A to reach evaporator set points after 11 years in service. \n \n2. The amount of kWh’s used to achieve similar evaporator set points in baseline and post periods. \n \n3. The thermal dynamic ability of the equipment to still perform at or close to operational design.  \nMethodology\nThe measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the \nIPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) framework. [Technical Specialist] and [Technical Specialist], \nworking in direct coordination with Clima-Check of Sweden, remotely collected and verified all of the pilot \nrefrigeration measurements. All of the temperature and pressure sensors were installed with support from \nRefrigeration Contractor A, Major US Warehouse Retailer’s refrigeration support contractor.  \nThe Clima-Check performance analyzer is specifically designed to monitor thermal dynamic and power efficiency \nperformance improvement in all types of HVAC and refrigeration systems instantaneously and over time. \nFor this pilot, ten days of data was collected prior to Rack-A being treated with the PermaFrost NMR® ECM \non 10 May 2014. The ECM was then allowed to work for a period of at least 400+ hours before any post \ncollection data was compared to the baseline data. \n \nTo reduce the impact the store and weather variables may have on the data, two similar periods of time with \nsimilar outside air temperatures and time of day were chosen to compare refrigeration performance before \nand after the ECM. These comparisons included:\nTuesday 8 April (75.5°) & Tuesday 29 April (77.2°), 1AM – 5AM (no activity in store)\nMonday 7 April (79.3°) & Monday 5 May (80.6°), 10AM – 9PM (full day of operations)\nThe boundary of the testing was the low and medium temperature compressors and nothing else; therefore \nthe performance calculations are extremely accurate.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 671, "chars": 3222, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_038_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_038_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:8789cb8c4de148ee9837371aa61537200de7bbd0e6a75358f02320a30fd09199"}

The average \ntonnage required to achieve the multiple low and medium evaporator set points has been reduced from 30.75 \nin each section of Rack-A down to 28.65. This equates to a reduction of 6.83%. The overall annual kWh’s \nassociated with the operation of Rack-A dropped 6.63%, from 1,486,660 kWh in the baseline to 1,388,032 in the \npost.  Given nearly identical voltage recorded in both the baseline and post measurement periods, the average \nAmps used by the compressors to reach given evaporator set points dropped from 208.4 down to 195.2, equating \nto 6.33%. Finally, the calculated kW/ton dropped from 2.76 to 2.58 which equates to a reduction of 6.52%.\nThe key system improvements have come by way of thermal dynamic efficiency improvement, which \ndemonstrates how much heat is being absorbed in the cooling cycle. In particular, the delta of the leaving \nrefrigerant temperature at the compressor and the refrigerant temperature returning from the evaporators.  For \nRack-A, the refrigerant delta in the baseline averaged 39.3 degrees and increased to 42.08 degrees in the post. \nThis equates to an increase in the thermal transfer ability of Rack-A of 7.1%   \nRefrigeration Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 680, "chars": 2567, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_038_chunk_0003", "next_id": "pdf_038_chunk_0005", "content_hash": "sha256:c9b3169e69fcc41449d5945b2f60dee2b4cb3a5cf881a5328adfe92e2f56b2b6"}

This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended \nin the Avoided Energy Reporting (Post) Analysis Period. In this case, where less tonnage is now required to achieve \nevaporator set points, the ROI first comes from determining what the cost to run Rack-A was when operating at the \noriginal energy profile. To account for the reduced amount of tonnage now needed to achieve set points, the original \ntonnage is used in the formulation of the post kW/ton rating. This post kW/ton rating is then used in conjunction with \nthe original tonnage and the actual kW produced by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. The result directly correlates with \nthe other savings achieved by the ECM. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for \nthe reduced number of hours the systems will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows \nthe systems to reach the internal evaporator set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor \ndemand loading.\n7\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\n28.8\nPassenger vehicles\n7\nGarbage trucks of waste sent to\nthe landﬁll instead of recycled\n15,375\nGallons of gasoline\nconsumed\n146,763\nPounds of coal burned\nannually\n318\nBarrels of oil\nconsumed\n.733\nRailcars worth\nof coal burned\n18.8\nHomes’ electricity use for\none year\n8\nMajor US Warehouse Retailer is Saving More than just Energy\nBy treating both refrigeration Racks in the Major US Warehouse Retailer store in [Florida Location], with PermaFrost NMR® and \nbased on the current manner in which Major US Warehouse Retailer operates these refrigeration systems, the company will save \napproximately 198,152 kWh per year and all the costs associated with those savings.

The Copeland \ncompressors are all original 11 year old units while the four Bitzer compressors have all been installed within \nthe last 3 years.\n \nGiven that Rack-A supports varying types and sizes of evaporators, it runs 8,760 hours at varying capacities.   \nCLEARWATER Major US Warehouse Retailer REFRIGERATION PLANT LAYOUT\nECONOMIZER\nLIQUID\nRECEIVER\nSUCTION\nRECEIVER\nAIR COOLED\nCONDENSER\nP=AI4\nT=T4\nP=AI1\nT=T3\nP=AI3\nT=T2\nLow Temp\nSuction Header\nCopeland Low Temp\nMed Temp\nSuction Header\nCommon Discharge\nHeader\nP=AI2\nT=T1\nT=T5\nT=T6\n1\nCopeland Med Temp\nBitzer Low Temp\nBitzer Med Temp\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nPower Connections\n1S1 & 1S2 CT1 = Comp 1-4\n4S1 & 4S2 CT2 = Comp 5-8\nCompressor Model Numbers\n1:  3DA3A075L-TFD-423\n2:  4B3139PH-2NU\n3:  4B3139ph-2NL\n4:  4DH3-250L-TSK-423\n5:  4B2707PL-2NU\n6:  4DT3F76KE-TSK-800\n7:  4B2707PL-2NU\n8:  3DB3A075L-TFD-423\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 772, "chars": 2389, "pages": {"start": 11, "end": 13}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_038_chunk_0007", "next_id": "", "content_hash": "sha256:3cb696d0266c9817b75c2ec39c99fe8897a58a7801c4ddcec653bfde8171966e"}
