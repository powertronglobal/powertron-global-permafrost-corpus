• Rack A now is using 2.1 fewer tons in the post to achieve the
same multiple evaporator set points as in the baseline.
• Using the national average cost per kWh of $.105, the reduction
of 99,076 kWh’s equates to an annual energy savings of $10,403.

Refrigeration Eﬃciency Study Results
Calculated Eﬃciency of Major US Warehouse Retailer Refrigeration Baseline and Post
The charts below illustrate where the energy savings achieved in this pilot are stemming from. The average 
tonnage required to achieve the multiple low and medium evaporator set points has been reduced from 30.75 
in each section of Rack-A down to 28.65. This equates to a reduction of 6.83%. The overall annual kWh’s 
associated with the operation of Rack-A dropped 6.63%, from 1,486,660 kWh in the baseline to 1,388,032 in the 
post.  Given nearly identical voltage recorded in both the baseline and post measurement periods, the average 
Amps used by the compressors to reach given evaporator set points dropped from 208.4 down to 195.2, equating 
to 6.33%. Finally, the calculated kW/ton dropped from 2.76 to 2.58 which equates to a reduction of 6.52%.
The key system improvements have come by way of thermal dynamic efficiency improvement, which 
demonstrates how much heat is being absorbed in the cooling cycle. In particular, the delta of the leaving 
refrigerant temperature at the compressor and the refrigerant temperature returning from the evaporators.  For 
Rack-A, the refrigerant delta in the baseline averaged 39.3 degrees and increased to 42.08 degrees in the post. 
This equates to an increase in the thermal transfer ability of Rack-A of 7.1%
