Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period 
for Major US Warehouse Retailer for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true 
energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended 
in the Avoided Energy Reporting (Post) Analysis Period. In this case, where less tonnage is now required to achieve 
evaporator set points, the ROI first comes from determining what the cost to run Rack-A was when operating at the 
original energy profile. To account for the reduced amount of tonnage now needed to achieve set points, the original 
tonnage is used in the formulation of the post kW/ton rating. This post kW/ton rating is then used in conjunction with 
the original tonnage and the actual kW produced by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. The result directly correlates with 
the other savings achieved by the ECM. This regression analysis is the most widely accepted method of accounting for 
the reduced number of hours the systems will now operate due to the restored capacity. This restored capacity allows 
the systems to reach the internal evaporator set points with increased efficiency resulting in reduced compressor 
demand loading.
