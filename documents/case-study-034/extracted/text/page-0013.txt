System Description
The Rack-A refrigeration system is depicted below. Four compressors support the low temperature evaporator 
freezers while the other four compressors support the medium temperature coolers in the store. The Copeland 
compressors are all original 11 year old units while the four Bitzer compressors have all been installed within 
the last 3 years.
 
Given that Rack-A supports varying types and sizes of evaporators, it runs 8,760 hours at varying capacities.
