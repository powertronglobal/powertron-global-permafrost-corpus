Recovered Wasted Energy with PermaFrost NMR® 
The chart to the right illustrates the performance
restoration the ECM created Rack-A following 
treatment.       . 
The average cost to operate Rack-A before 
it was treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as 
calculated in kW/ton, was 2.76.
The specific cost to operate Rack-A after it was 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, is currently 2.58. This equates to a 6.52%
reduction in kW/ton.
The delta of the refrigeration kW/ton ratings 
measured in-situ were expected as they fell within the 
average improvement savings shown over more than 
120,000 installations globally.
