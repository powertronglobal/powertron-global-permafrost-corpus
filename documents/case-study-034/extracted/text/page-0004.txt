Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content detailed in this report will first demonstrate the ability of the low and medium temperature 
portions of Rack-A to perform prior to PermaFrost NMR® (ECM) being installed, as well as illustrate the 
amount of thermal degradation within the heat exchangers. 
Following a diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment to determine the operational condition of the 
systems was satisfactory, Baseline M&V data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. Approximately 
five weeks after installation of PermaFrost NMR®, the M&V team returned to uninstall all the monitoring 
equipment after verifying with Clima-Check that the data taken during the pilot was satisfactory. The delta of 
these combination of measurements and associated calculations show the amount improvement the 
PermaFrost NMR® had on Rack-A.
The following report was produced utilizing the IPMVP framework as the M&V plan.
The results were tracked by the Clima-Check Performance Analyzer either directly or formulated by 
entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
• kWh= kW * Runtime Hours
 
• Thermal Transfer Delta T = Evap Temp Leaving – Returning Refrigerant Temp
 
• Amps = direct collection showing amount of work the compressor is doing
 
• kW = (Volts * Amps * Power Factor * √3) / 1000
