HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report
Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study
Thermal degradation is well documented by the American Society of 
Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) and 
the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). It is a major cause of 
capacity loss in Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and 
Refrigeration (HVACR) systems, preventing them from operating at the 
original design efficiency. 
The purpose of this efficiency study is to verify the effectiveness of the 
PermaFrost NMR® Energy Conservation Measure (ECM) in Major US Warehouse Retailer’s 
refrigeration systems and document the future energy cost reductions 
associated with the same.

Rack-A was forensically tested using the IPMVP methodology to determine the low and 
medium compressor performance capabilities before and after the implementation of the 
PermaFrost ECM. Rack-B was also treated so store’s power bill would reflect reduction 
resulting from total refrigeration improvement. Images below left are of the awards the 
Clima-Check performance analyzer has won in the field of thermal dynamic improvement 
monitoring. Image directly below is of the Clima-Check performance analyzer itself.
