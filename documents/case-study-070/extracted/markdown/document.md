Energy Performance Report

Data Center Provider Chicago Data Center

June 5, 2013

Executive Summary

This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure

(ECM) PermaFrost NMR® in Oak Brook, IL for Data Center Provider Data Center. Detailed forensic performance testing

(outlined later in this report) was performed on a 30 ton Liebert DX unit.

Immediately following the baseline testing, both stages were treated with the proper amount and type of

PermaFrost NMR® product formulated for R-22 DX systems. Since there were no other ECM’s going on

during this pilot project, the improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at the units is

solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. The unit(s) now provides cooler/drier supply air while

using less power. This greater operational efficiency is due to the restoration of the heat transfer ability of

the evaporator and condenser coils.

Following treatment of PermaFrost NMR® the unit showed a substantial increase in coil capacity of 179,434

Btuh or 47.1% improvement overall system efficiency. This restored capacity equates to 15 tons. The unit

also showed a substantial reduction in total Watts of 31.8% and an 46.6% improvement in COP.

Additionally, the unit showed an 33.5% improvement in Enthalpy Delta, which is another measurable way

to view the thermodynamic enhancement of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.

The result of the ECM improvements is an ROI to customer of just 6.3 months. The tables of data and

financial calculations are available for review at the end of this report.

Product Brief

PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure

(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) technology as its core agent. A sustainable,

one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any

type of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and

equipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX);

chilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia

refrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The

equipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single

and multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.

The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and

improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point temperatures in a more

rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from the

enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW hours

used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced carbon footprint

for Data Center Provider.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol

The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) is utilized in the

development of this report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating,

Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization

(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation

methods and products.

There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They

are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Retrofit Isolation

(Option B) is defined as: All parameter measurement with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as

the single source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the

energy conservation method affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the

baseline data.

Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the

savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term

measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by

short-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using

measurements of proxies of energy use.

The final computation follows the formula:

Energy Science Division

Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy

+ - Routine adjustments / + - Non-Routine Adjustments

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content

The content of the following report will demonstrate the effects of PermaFrost NMR®’s ability to correct the

effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces.

A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment is implemented to determine if the unit’s operational

conditions are satisfactory. Baseline measurements were recorded and the proper amount and type of

Permafrost were injected. The product was allowed 4 weeks to seat itself into the metal surfaces. At the end

of this gestation period, post M&V results were taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking

special care to match the same or very similar entering air temperatures and compressor discharge

pressures.

It was determined by Data Center Provider that the units run approximately 4,380 hours annually at a kWh cost of .08

cents per kW.

A Local 73 union sheet metal worker who is employed by RMC INC., took the CFM readings. There were 19

points that were traversed on the return duct, which was every 6" across the entire length of the duct. Each

measurement was documented and measured with a hot wire anemometer. This procedure was done three

times on the Baseline and the Energy Reporting (post) periods. The three readings from the Baseline where

averaged and then this process was repeated in the Energy Reporting Period.

The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP International Performance Measurement and

Verification Protocol as the M&V plan. The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global®’s

Forensic Mechanical Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer].

The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:

kW = Volts x Amperage x 1.64 (.95 x 1.732) / 1000 (for 3-phase)

Actual GPM = GPM2 = GPM * Measured Pressure Drop (ft) / by Design Pressure Drop (ft) (squared)

MEASUREMENT

The post DB temperature (75.2 vs. 75.3 deg. F) entering the coil was matched as close as possible to the

baseline period. After matching this temperature the post readings were taken to ensure that the work the

coil had to do was as similar to the baseline.

** The nominal capacity for the HVAC units in this report were determined ARI (American Refrigeration Institute) at

the conditions of incoming condenser air at 95 degree F and entering evaporator air temperature of 80 degrees F. The

conditions during this M&V procedures were less than the design parameters, which accounted for the capacities well

above design even before the ECM PermaFrost NMR® was installed. These conditions were present in both baseline

and post (Energy Reporting Period) periods therefore the improvements PermaFrost NMR® brought about are sound

and scientifically verified.

Results

The following are the final calculated performance measurements after performing the regression analysis to

account to the restored capacity brought about by PermaFrost NMR®.

Baseline kWh       (55,315 Watts / 1,000) * 4,380 Annual Operating Hours = 242,280 kWh

Baseline Cost To Run       242,280 kWh * $.08 = $19,382 USD

Regression Analysis

Adjusted Base Tonnage       46.7 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)

Adjusted Total Watts       1,741 Watts per Ton * 46.7 tons = 81,305 Total Watts

Adjusted Base kWh       (81,305 Watts /1,000) * 4,380 Annual Operating hrs = 356,116 kWh

Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM       356,116 kWh * $.08 = $28,489 USD

Post ECM kWh       (55,486 Watts / 1,000) * 4,380 Annual Operating hrs = 243,029 kWh

Cost to Run After ECM       243,029 kWh * $.08 = $19,442 USD

Cost Savings per Month       ($28,489 - $19,442) / 12 = $754

Cost of PermaFrost NMR® @ $4,750 / $754 = 6.3 months

ROI = 6.3 months
