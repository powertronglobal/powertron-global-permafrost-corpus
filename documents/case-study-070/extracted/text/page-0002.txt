Energy Performance Report

Executive Summary
         This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure 
(ECM) PermaFrost NMR® in Oak Brook, IL for Data Center Provider Data Center. Detailed forensic performance testing 
(outlined later in this report) was performed on a 30 ton Liebert DX unit. 
Immediately following the baseline testing, both stages were treated with the proper amount and type of 
PermaFrost NMR® product formulated for R-22 DX systems. Since there were no other ECM’s going on 
during this pilot project, the improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at the units is 
solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. The unit(s) now provides cooler/drier supply air while 
using less power. This greater operational efficiency is due to the restoration of the heat transfer ability of 
the evaporator and condenser coils.
Following treatment of PermaFrost NMR® the unit showed a substantial increase in coil capacity of 179,434 
Btuh or 47.1% improvement overall system efficiency. This restored capacity equates to 15 tons. The unit 
also showed a substantial reduction in total Watts of 31.8% and an 46.6% improvement in COP. 
Additionally, the unit showed an 33.5% improvement in Enthalpy Delta, which is another measurable way 
to view the thermodynamic enhancement of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. 
The result of the ECM improvements is an ROI to customer of just 6.3 months. The tables of data and 
financial calculations are available for review at the end of this report.
