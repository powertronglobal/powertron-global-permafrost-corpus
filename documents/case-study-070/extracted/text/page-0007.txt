MEASUREMENT
The post DB temperature (75.2 vs. 75.3 deg. F) entering the coil was matched as close as possible to the 
baseline period. After matching this temperature the post readings were taken to ensure that the work the 
coil had to do was as similar to the baseline. 
** The nominal capacity for the HVAC units in this report were determined ARI (American Refrigeration Institute) at 
the conditions of incoming condenser air at 95 degree F and entering evaporator air temperature of 80 degrees F. The 
conditions during this M&V procedures were less than the design parameters, which accounted for the capacities well 
above design even before the ECM PermaFrost NMR® was installed. These conditions were present in both baseline 
and post (Energy Reporting Period) periods therefore the improvements PermaFrost NMR® brought about are sound 
and scientifically verified.
