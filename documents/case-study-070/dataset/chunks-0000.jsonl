Detailed forensic performance testing \n(outlined later in this report) was performed on a 30 ton Liebert DX unit. \nImmediately following the baseline testing, both stages were treated with the proper amount and type of \nPermaFrost NMR® product formulated for R-22 DX systems. Since there were no other ECM’s going on \nduring this pilot project, the improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at the units is \nsolely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. The unit(s) now provides cooler/drier supply air while \nusing less power. This greater operational efficiency is due to the restoration of the heat transfer ability of \nthe evaporator and condenser coils.\nFollowing treatment of PermaFrost NMR® the unit showed a substantial increase in coil capacity of 179,434 \nBtuh or 47.1% improvement overall system efficiency. This restored capacity equates to 15 tons. The unit \nalso showed a substantial reduction in total Watts of 31.8% and an 46.6% improvement in COP. \nAdditionally, the unit showed an 33.5% improvement in Enthalpy Delta, which is another measurable way \nto view the thermodynamic enhancement of the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. \nThe result of the ECM improvements is an ROI to customer of just 6.3 months. The tables of data and \nfinancial calculations are available for review at the end of this report.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 545, "chars": 2485, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_070_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:9a274b103feb2f54eaf351a79eedc9e62f3f0d3752e87d54c94c713bb4e7366a"}

A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any \ntype of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and \nequipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); \nchilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia \nrefrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The \nequipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single \nand multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and \nimproved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point temperatures in a more \nrapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from the \nenhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW hours \nused, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced carbon footprint \nfor Data Center Provider.\nEnergy Science Division\nOIL BUILD-UP\nOIL REMOVED\nBEFORE TREATMENT\nAFTER TREATMENT\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 435, "chars": 2075, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_070_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_070_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:8294db74465f8f3b154fd097ac117ad4d650d51ea3c109a8e993038bf4c398d1"}

The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, \nRefrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization \n(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation \nmethods and products.\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Retrofit Isolation \n(Option B) is defined as: All parameter measurement with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as \nthe single source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the \nenergy conservation method affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the \nbaseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using \nmeasurements of proxies of energy use.\nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+ - Routine adjustments / + - Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 439, "chars": 2182, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_070_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_070_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:dd371999a586f9124f14975f6f07af93a7f327cbfa7f84196aa7f5cda63a3970"}

Baseline measurements were recorded and the proper amount and type of \nPermafrost were injected. The product was allowed 4 weeks to seat itself into the metal surfaces. At the end \nof this gestation period, post M&V results were taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking \nspecial care to match the same or very similar entering air temperatures and compressor discharge \npressures. \nIt was determined by Data Center Provider that the units run approximately 4,380 hours annually at a kWh cost of .08 \ncents per kW.\nA Local 73 union sheet metal worker who is employed by RMC INC., took the CFM readings. There were 19 \npoints that were traversed on the return duct, which was every 6\" across the entire length of the duct. Each \nmeasurement was documented and measured with a hot wire anemometer. This procedure was done three \ntimes on the Baseline and the Energy Reporting (post) periods. The three readings from the Baseline where \naveraged and then this process was repeated in the Energy Reporting Period.\nThe following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP International Performance Measurement and \nVerification Protocol as the M&V plan. The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global®’s \nForensic Mechanical Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer].\nThe results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:\n \nkW = Volts x Amperage x 1.64 (.95 x 1.732) / 1000 (for 3-phase)\n \nActual GPM = GPM2 = GPM * Measured Pressure Drop (ft) / by Design Pressure Drop (ft) (squared)\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 538, "chars": 2484, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_070_chunk_0003", "next_id": "pdf_070_chunk_0005", "content_hash": "sha256:ba05abe14191be6a18dd8355a21ada177b459ae6a9019953699fe1a3985441c5"}
