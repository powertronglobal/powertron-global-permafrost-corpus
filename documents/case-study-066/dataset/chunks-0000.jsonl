Detailed forensic performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed \non the three units.  Following testing, each unit was treated with the proper amount and type of the \nPermaFrost NMR® technology specially formulated for these types of systems.\nMeasurement and Verification (M&V) was conducted to establish an initial energy baseline and a post \navoided energy-reporting period. The purpose of the testing was to show how the ECM improves the \nthermal performance of any system it is installed in.\nThe improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at each unit was solely attributable to \nPermaFrost NMR® ECM. This is a result of the reversal of thermal inefficiency on the heat exchanger surfaces.\nHeat Pump / DX\nFollowing treatment with the ECM, the lobby heat pump (HVAC Equipment Manufacturer 12.5 ton) unit showed an effective 29.8% \nreduction in kW/ton based on the exact capacity measured in the baseline M&V and the post gestation \nM&V. The ECM also produced an increase cooling capacity of 33.3%; which equates to 2.25 tons. Prior to the \nECM, the unit produced a total of 6.76 tons of cooling as measured in-situ (one compressor engaged). After \nthe ECM, the average combined tonnage produced increased to 9.01 tons (one compressor engaged). This \nincrease in cooling capacity increase from the baseline performance levels led to an effective increase in COP \nof 42.5% and a calculated reduction in kWh of 37.8%. All of these factors directly correlate to what Commercial Real Estate Company \nRealty will realize in energy savings as they operate this unit in the future under the same parameters.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 657, "chars": 2970, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_067_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:6f5adc3709ba0fa965baec34dec44f17ea1391b3224061bc0bd8c05d5592ccab"}

The ECM \nalso produced an increase cooling capacity of 29.5%; which equates to 1.17 tons. Prior to the ECM, the unit \nproduced a total of 3.96 tons of cooling as measured in-situ. After the ECM, the average combined tonnage \nproduced increased to 5.13 tons. This increase in cooling capacity increase from the baseline performance \nlevels led to an effective increase in COP of 20% and a calculated reduction in kWh of 23.9%. All of these \nfactors directly correlate to what Commercial Real Estate Company Realty will realize in energy savings as they operate this unit in the \nfuture under the same parameters.\nFollowing treatment the two treated units mentioned above also showed a combined 31.5% increase in the \nEnthalpy Delta across the coil versus the Baseline, which is a critical measurement used to determine the \nthermodynamic enhancement brought about by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. The RTU’s also showed a \nsignificant improvement in refrigeration approach of 30.9%.\nChiller\nFollowing treatment with the PermaFrost \nNMR® technology and operating at 65% load \namps, the chiller showed an effective net \naverage 20.6% reduction in kW/ton and an \nincrease in capacity of 36.4%. The operating \ntonnage grew substantially from 483.6 tons to \n659.6 tons. This capacity increase from the \nbaseline performance level resulted in an \neffective average increase in COP of 24.4%. All of these factors directly correlate to what Commercial Real Estate Company Realty will \nrealize in energy savings as they operate this chiller in the future under the same parameters.\nFollowing treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, the refrigerant approach was also lowered \nfrom 6.4°F to 1.1°F. This represents a 82.8% improvement in approach, which is another measureable way to \ndetermine the thermodynamic enhancement brought about by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.\nThe result of the ECM improvements in all three (3) units) is an ROI to Commercial Real Estate Company Realty that is measured in months. \nThe tables of data used to determine the financial payback are available for review at the end of this report.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 668, "chars": 2962, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_067_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_067_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:791cc18c7ab9db8bea2da75105ceb6b5e097060ffdfb1c833037e7ab51468a1b"}

A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for at least 10 years in any type of \nsystem in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and equipment that \nPermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); chilled water systems \n(both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia refrigeration plants (single \ncompressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The equipment utilized in these \nsystems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single and multi-stage), scroll, \nreciprocating and screw configurations.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® in any type of HVACR system are improved cooling performance, \nincreased capacity and improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point \ntemperatures in a more rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits \nresulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, \nless kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced \ncarbon footprint for Commercial Real Estate Company Realty.\nBOUNDARY LAYER\nOIL REMOVED\nBEFORE TREATMENT\nAFTER TREATMENT\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 459, "chars": 2171, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_067_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_067_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:54667eff61bbf9e122feac5c094538cc60a99e18d03a6ea58ca1331473195523"}

They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is \ndefined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM as the single source of \nmeasurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM affected \nequipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations \nusing measurements of proxies of energy use. \nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+/ - Routine Adjustments +/ - Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 427, "chars": 2142, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_067_chunk_0003", "next_id": "pdf_067_chunk_0005", "content_hash": "sha256:267075793858ef7f3c111696b14f94a53c4214a015dd82d0792912f4e27e869c"}

Baseline M&V was recorded on each of the three units and then \nthe proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected directly into the suction side of the \nrefrigerant loop. The gestation period for the Commercial Real Estate Company Realty pilot was 4 weeks. At the end of this gestation \nperiod, Post M&V results were taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match \nthe same or very similar outside air temperatures as well as the wet bulb and dry bulb temperatures of the \nair entering the respective coils. These are three of the most critical variables to contend with in an in-situ \nHVAC testing situation. When analyzing all of the data in the baseline and post, only the lobby unit \nrequired an amp adjustment slightly downwards due to the fact that the O.A.T. in the post was 6 degrees F \nwarmer. The other two units, the chiller and the elevator room, did not require any adjustments.\nThe HVAC Equipment Manufacturer 12.5 ton unit’s (servicing the lobby) performance was validated at only 50% of its operating \ncapacity due to available building load. All measurements were taken with only one compressor operating \nbut both circuits were treated.\n  \nThe following report produces the utilization of \nthe International Performance Measurement \nand Verification Protocol (IPMVP) as the M&V \nplan. Sara Neff, Vice President of Sustainability, \nand Bill Wendt, Vice President of Facilities and \nEngineering, of Commercial Real Estate Company Realty, and Sarah Woods \nof CleanTek were all involved and witnessed \nthis pilot.

For the Elevator Room \nunit (Bard) the outside air temperatures as well as dry bulb temperatures entering the coil were the same in \nboth periods so no adjustments to the data was necessary. However, for the Lobby Unit (HVAC Equipment Manufacturer) the OAT was \nhigher in the post period for the Lobby unit therefore a weather adjustment was made and the amps were \nadjusted slightly downwards by 5.4%. The adjustment only accounted for the post weather being 78 deg. F \n(not 80) in the post due to the standard deviation +/- 2 degrees. The DB entering temps were matched.

This greater capacity reduces the runtime hours and in \nturn reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post. The true ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the \nsystem was when operating at its original energy profile then subtracting the cost to operate the system at its newly \nrestored energy profile less the percentage of increased capacity. This regression calculation is the most scientific \nmethod of accounting for the reduced number of hours the units will now run due to their increased capacity which \nallows the units to reach set temperatures quicker and shut off sooner.\nBaseline kWh        163.3 kW * 3,744 Annual Operating Hrs = 611,395 kWh\nCost to Run Baseline        611,395 kWh * $.1333 = $81,498.95\nPost ECM kWh        179.2 kW * 3,744 Annual Operating Hrs = 670,925 kWh\nRevised kWh (based on avg. 36.4% restored capacity)        670,925 kWh * (1 - .364) = 426,708 kWh\nRevised Cost to Run Post        426,708 kWh * $.1333 = $56,880.18\nAvoided Energy Costs (Savings) Per Month        ($81,498.95 - $56,880.18) / 12 = $2,051.56\nCost of ECM        $14,375\nROI        $14,375 / $2,051.56 = 7 months \n \n ROI = 7 months   \nEﬃciency\nImprovements\nkWh\nkW per Ton*\nOperating Tonnage*\nCOP\nRefrigerant Approach\n(30.3%) \n(20.6%) \n36.4%\n24.4%\n82.8%\nPost\n426,708*   \n.27 \n659.6 \n12.95\n1.1\nBaseline\n611,395 \n.34 \n483.6 \n10.41\n6.4\n(adjusted for\nincreased capacity) \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\nCarbon Footprint Reduction\nIn conclusion, regarding the carbon footprint reduction in respect to this project, Commercial Real Estate Company Realty will save the \nenvironment 148 metric tons of green house gas emissions -carbon dioxide- as well as saved 209,771 \n(690,253 baseline – 480,482 post) kWh of power, for implementing this ECM in these 3 units.\nEnergy Science Division\nThe greenhouse gas emissions\nfrom 30.8 passenger vehicles\neach year.\nThe CO2 emissions from 16,592\ngallons of gasoline consumed. \nThe CO2 emissions from 344\nbarrels of oil consumed.\nThe CO2 emissions from 6,167\npropane cylinders used for home barbeques. \nThe CO2 emissions from the electricity\nuse of 20.4 homes for one year.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 862, "chars": 3427, "pages": {"start": 13, "end": 15}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_067_chunk_0009", "next_id": "", "content_hash": "sha256:57bb35d34e5c1c7d98b6ff99b600bdf93ed808a9d00c0a6c2eb81f96fce0ca79"}
