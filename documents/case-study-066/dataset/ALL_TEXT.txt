PermaFrost NMR® Eﬃciency Report
Commercial Real Estate Company Realty Corporation
September, 2013
Executive Summary
         This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy conservation measure 
(ECM) PermaFrost NMR® into one (1) package RTU heat pump, one (1) package modular DX unit located at 
12100 Olympic Blvd. in Los Angeles, CA., and one (1) water-cooled chiller located at 909 North Sepulveda 
Blvd. in El Segundo, CA. Detailed forensic performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed 
on the three units.  Following testing, each unit was treated with the proper amount and type of the 
PermaFrost NMR® technology specially formulated for these types of systems.
Measurement and Verification (M&V) was conducted to establish an initial energy baseline and a post 
avoided energy-reporting period. The purpose of the testing was to show how the ECM improves the 
thermal performance of any system it is installed in.
The improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at each unit was solely attributable to 
PermaFrost NMR® ECM. This is a result of the reversal of thermal inefficiency on the heat exchanger surfaces.
Heat Pump / DX
Following treatment with the ECM, the lobby heat pump (HVAC Equipment Manufacturer 12.5 ton) unit showed an effective 29.8% 
reduction in kW/ton based on the exact capacity measured in the baseline M&V and the post gestation 
M&V. The ECM also produced an increase cooling capacity of 33.3%; which equates to 2.25 tons. Prior to the 
ECM, the unit produced a total of 6.76 tons of cooling as measured in-situ (one compressor engaged). After 
the ECM, the average combined tonnage produced increased to 9.01 tons (one compressor engaged). This 
increase in cooling capacity increase from the baseline performance levels led to an effective increase in COP 
of 42.5% and a calculated reduction in kWh of 37.8%. All of these factors directly correlate to what Commercial Real Estate Company 
Realty will realize in energy savings as they operate this unit in the future under the same parameters.

Following treatment with the ECM, the elevator room (Bard 5 ton) unit showed an effective 16.4% reduction 
in kW/ton based on the exact capacity measured in the baseline M&V and the post gestation M&V. The ECM 
also produced an increase cooling capacity of 29.5%; which equates to 1.17 tons. Prior to the ECM, the unit 
produced a total of 3.96 tons of cooling as measured in-situ. After the ECM, the average combined tonnage 
produced increased to 5.13 tons. This increase in cooling capacity increase from the baseline performance 
levels led to an effective increase in COP of 20% and a calculated reduction in kWh of 23.9%. All of these 
factors directly correlate to what Commercial Real Estate Company Realty will realize in energy savings as they operate this unit in the 
future under the same parameters.
Following treatment the two treated units mentioned above also showed a combined 31.5% increase in the 
Enthalpy Delta across the coil versus the Baseline, which is a critical measurement used to determine the 
thermodynamic enhancement brought about by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. The RTU’s also showed a 
significant improvement in refrigeration approach of 30.9%.
Chiller
Following treatment with the PermaFrost 
NMR® technology and operating at 65% load 
amps, the chiller showed an effective net 
average 20.6% reduction in kW/ton and an 
increase in capacity of 36.4%. The operating 
tonnage grew substantially from 483.6 tons to 
659.6 tons. This capacity increase from the 
baseline performance level resulted in an 
effective average increase in COP of 24.4%. All of these factors directly correlate to what Commercial Real Estate Company Realty will 
realize in energy savings as they operate this chiller in the future under the same parameters.
Following treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, the refrigerant approach was also lowered 
from 6.4°F to 1.1°F. This represents a 82.8% improvement in approach, which is another measureable way to 
determine the thermodynamic enhancement brought about by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.
The result of the ECM improvements in all three (3) units) is an ROI to Commercial Real Estate Company Realty that is measured in months. 
The tables of data used to determine the financial payback are available for review at the end of this report.

Product Brief
         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure 
(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative® (NMR™) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, 
one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for at least 10 years in any type of 
system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and equipment that 
PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); chilled water systems 
(both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia refrigeration plants (single 
compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The equipment utilized in these 
systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single and multi-stage), scroll, 
reciprocating and screw configurations.
The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® in any type of HVACR system are improved cooling performance, 
increased capacity and improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point 
temperatures in a more rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits 
resulting from the enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, 
less kW hours used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced 
carbon footprint for Commercial Real Estate Company Realty.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol
The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) was utilized in the 
development of this report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating, 
Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization 
(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation 
methods and products.
There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They 
are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is 
defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM as the single source of 
measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM affected 
equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.
Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the 
savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term 
measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by 
short-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations 
using measurements of proxies of energy use. 
The final computation follows the formula:
Energy Science Division
Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy
+/ - Routine Adjustments +/ - Non-Routine Adjustments

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content
The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the 
effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces. 
A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the operational 
conditions of the systems were satisfactory. Baseline M&V was recorded on each of the three units and then 
the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected directly into the suction side of the 
refrigerant loop. The gestation period for the Commercial Real Estate Company Realty pilot was 4 weeks. At the end of this gestation 
period, Post M&V results were taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match 
the same or very similar outside air temperatures as well as the wet bulb and dry bulb temperatures of the 
air entering the respective coils. These are three of the most critical variables to contend with in an in-situ 
HVAC testing situation. When analyzing all of the data in the baseline and post, only the lobby unit 
required an amp adjustment slightly downwards due to the fact that the O.A.T. in the post was 6 degrees F 
warmer. The other two units, the chiller and the elevator room, did not require any adjustments.
The HVAC Equipment Manufacturer 12.5 ton unit’s (servicing the lobby) performance was validated at only 50% of its operating 
capacity due to available building load. All measurements were taken with only one compressor operating 
but both circuits were treated.
  
The following report produces the utilization of 
the International Performance Measurement 
and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) as the M&V 
plan. Sara Neff, Vice President of Sustainability, 
and Bill Wendt, Vice President of Facilities and 
Engineering, of Commercial Real Estate Company Realty, and Sarah Woods 
of CleanTek were all involved and witnessed 
this pilot. The final calculations were performed 
by Powertron Global®’s Forensic Mechanical 
Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer].

The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
BTUH = CFM * 4.5 * Wet Bulb Enthalpy Delta
 
kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
 
Percentage Eﬃciency = Measured BTUH / Manufacturers Design BTUH
 
Coeﬃcient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
 
Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU 
 
Refrigerant Approach = Supply Water Temp – Saturated Evaporator Temp (CH) or Supply Air  -

       Detailed Results
System Description / Design Characteristics
The Lobby unit is a heat pump and the efficiency gains brought about by PermaFrost NMR® can be utilized in 
both heating and cooling mode. Given the internal load of the facility and national weather BIN data, it is 
estimated that this RTU runs ~4,380 hours per year prior to the ECM being implemented. The elevator room unit 
has a constant heat load and runs year around at an estimated ~4,500 hours per year prior to the ECM being 
implemented.
Baseline and Post Measurements
The identical IPMVP following data points were recorded for Baseline and Post on 8/8/13 and 9/13/13 
respectively using recently NIST-calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. For the Elevator Room 
unit (Bard) the outside air temperatures as well as dry bulb temperatures entering the coil were the same in 
both periods so no adjustments to the data was necessary. However, for the Lobby Unit (HVAC Equipment Manufacturer) the OAT was 
higher in the post period for the Lobby unit therefore a weather adjustment was made and the amps were 
adjusted slightly downwards by 5.4%. The adjustment only accounted for the post weather being 78 deg. F 
(not 80) in the post due to the standard deviation +/- 2 degrees. The DB entering temps were matched. The 
measurements are as follows:

The following are the final calculated average performance measurement improvements following the 
PermaFrost NMR® Post measurement periods on the two Commercial Real Estate Company Realty RTU’s.  
PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for Commercial Real Estate Company Realty
Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Commercial Real Estate Company 
Realty for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true 
energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This greater capacity reduces the runtime hours and in 
turn reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post. The true ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the 
system was when operating at its original energy profile then subtracting the cost to operate the system at its newly 
restored energy profile less the percentage of increased capacity. This regression calculation is the most scientific 
method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the units will now run due to their increased capacity which 
allows the units to reach set temperatures quicker and shut off sooner.
