System Description / Design Characteristics
The Lobby unit is a heat pump and the efficiency gains brought about by PermaFrost NMR® can be utilized in 
both heating and cooling mode. Given the internal load of the facility and national weather BIN data, it is 
estimated that this RTU runs ~4,380 hours per year prior to the ECM being implemented. The elevator room unit 
has a constant heat load and runs year around at an estimated ~4,500 hours per year prior to the ECM being 
implemented.
Baseline and Post Measurements
The identical IPMVP following data points were recorded for Baseline and Post on 8/8/13 and 9/13/13 
respectively using recently NIST-calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. For the Elevator Room 
unit (Bard) the outside air temperatures as well as dry bulb temperatures entering the coil were the same in 
both periods so no adjustments to the data was necessary. However, for the Lobby Unit (HVAC Equipment Manufacturer) the OAT was 
higher in the post period for the Lobby unit therefore a weather adjustment was made and the amps were 
adjusted slightly downwards by 5.4%. The adjustment only accounted for the post weather being 78 deg. F 
(not 80) in the post due to the standard deviation +/- 2 degrees. The DB entering temps were matched. The 
measurements are as follows:
