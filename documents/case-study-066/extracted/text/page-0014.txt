PermaFrost NMR®: Determining the Payback Period for Commercial Real Estate Company Realty
Utilizing data in the above charts, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period for Commercial Real Estate Company 
Realty for implementing the PermaFrost NMR® ECM, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true 
energy savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This greater capacity reduces the runtime hours and in 
turn reduces the annual kWh expended in the Post. The true ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the 
system was when operating at its original energy profile then subtracting the cost to operate the system at its newly 
restored energy profile less the percentage of increased capacity. This regression calculation is the most scientific 
method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the units will now run due to their increased capacity which 
allows the units to reach set temperatures quicker and shut off sooner.
Baseline kWh        163.3 kW * 3,744 Annual Operating Hrs = 611,395 kWh
Cost to Run Baseline        611,395 kWh * $.1333 = $81,498.95
Post ECM kWh        179.2 kW * 3,744 Annual Operating Hrs = 670,925 kWh
Revised kWh (based on avg. 36.4% restored capacity)        670,925 kWh * (1 - .364) = 426,708 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Post        426,708 kWh * $.1333 = $56,880.18
Avoided Energy Costs (Savings) Per Month        ($81,498.95 - $56,880.18) / 12 = $2,051.56
Cost of ECM        $14,375
ROI        $14,375 / $2,051.56 = 7 months 
 
 ROI = 7 months
