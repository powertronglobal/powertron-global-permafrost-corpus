Detailed forensic \nperformance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on both of the nominal 20-ton CRAC units, \neach outfitted with two compressors using R22 refrigerant. Following testing, the CRACs were treated with \nthe proper amount and type of the PermaFrost NMR® technology specially formulated for these types of \nsystems.  Measurement and Verification (M&V) was conducted pre-installation and post-gestation.\n \nThe improvement in efficiency and restored \ncapacity gained directly across both systems \nwas solely attributable to the PermaFrost \nNMR® ECM. This is a result of the reversal of \nthermal inefficiency on heat exchange surfaces, creating \ngreater efficiency in refrigerant approach and \nthe thermal energy transfer abilities of the \ncooler and condenser vessels. \nFollowing treatment with the PermaFrost \nNMR® technology, the systems showed an \neffective net average 41.4% reduction in \nkW/ton based on the exact capacity measured \nin the baseline M&V and the post gestation M&V. With each of the 20-ton CRACs operating at full load, the \nsystems showed an average 24.2% reduction in kW consumption while simultaneously producing an \nincrease in average capacity of 4.3 tons. This 31.9% average capacity increase from the baseline performance \nlevels produced an effective average increase in system efficiency of 31.9%, which directly correlates to what \nRegional Cable Provider will realize in energy savings as they operate these systems in the future under the same parameters. \nDriving these savings was an average 23.5% reduction in amp draw under full load conditions.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 623, "chars": 2865, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_091_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:81806cc1b08e6bfef682ed39b0f4bf35fed45e852bc25af600c337f4f9fe1550"}

The result of the ECM \nimprovement is an ROI to Regional Cable Provider that is measured in months. The tables of data are available for review at \nthe end of this report. Financial calculations determining the true ROI are proprietary to Regional Cable Provider under \nseparate cover.  \nProduct Brief\n         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure \n(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any \ntype of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and \nequipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); \nchilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia \nrefrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The \nequipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal \n(single and multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and \nimproved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point temperatures in a more \nrapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from the \nenhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW hours \nused, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced carbon footprint \nfor Regional Cable Provider.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 534, "chars": 2616, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_091_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_091_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:4dfc4298ec33dc2fed0f40206d1c77d97f34c9b4fc2de6d5b5a53d495045848a"}

The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating, \nRefrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization \n(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation \nmethods and products.\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is \ndefined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single \nsource of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM \naffected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations \nusing measurements of proxies of energy use. \nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+/ - Routine Adjustments +/ - Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 444, "chars": 2204, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_091_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_091_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:05e4bfb51762e1aea0bb2feaa67b8bbe1d9924355aa038a42321552bba27688f"}

Baseline M&V were recorded and then the proper amount and type of \nPermaFrost NMR® was injected. The gestation period for the Regional Cable Provider pilot was six (6) weeks on these \nparticular CRACs to allow them each to achieve the required ~300 hours of runtime on each system to \nensure adequate performance improvement time. At the end of this gestation period, Post M&V results \nwere taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same or very similar \nentering air temperatures and compressor discharge pressures. These are the two most critical \nmeasurements affected by the weather. When analyzing the data, no adjustments for weather were \nnecessary.\n \nThe following report produces the utilization of the International Performance Measurement and \nVerification Protocol (IPMVP) as the M&V plan. Mike Romanovitch and Jeff Stage from Regional Cable Provider witnessed the \ncollection of the data used in this report. The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global’s \nForensic Mechanical Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer].  \nThe results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:\n \nkW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) \n \nBTUH = CFM * 4.5 (standard air) * Calculated Enthalpy Delta\n \nkW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage \n \nPercentage Eﬃciency = Measured BTUH / Manufacturers Design BTUH\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 506, "chars": 2342, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_091_chunk_0003", "next_id": "pdf_091_chunk_0005", "content_hash": "sha256:75a5392b3fa454e9e9401de3e0e499afe791ac4c3230b210bf8016473bb619e0"}

Both Baseline and Post analysis reporting \nperiod energy measurements were repeated during the data gathering \nperiods in the identical manner. The performance of the CRAC units is \nbeing affected by the HVAC facility design. Changing the duct work to \nallow the supply air from CRAC unit #2 to flow directly into the data \ncenter instead of being routed through CRAC unit #1 first will serve to \nfurther enhance the overall facility performance and reduce energy usage \neven more. \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 685, "chars": 2820, "pages": {"start": 7, "end": 9}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_091_chunk_0005", "next_id": "", "content_hash": "sha256:433581b27997cccf35d4cd8536084f0b993cd1e9de08fddd2545614bdc12f140"}
