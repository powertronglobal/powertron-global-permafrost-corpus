Detailed Results for CRAC Units 1 & 2
System Description / Design Characteristics
These CRAC units provide the critical cooling for the data center at the Regional Cable Provider facility in Allentown, PA. Each 
CRAC runs ~3,200 hours per year in alternating weekly cycles according to the Regional Cable Provider facility team. 
Baseline and Post Measurements
The identical IPMVP following data points were recorded for Baseline and Post on 4/3/13 and 5/15/13 
respectively using recently NIST calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. The Return Air entering 
the coil was very similar in both periods. Additionally, the discharge pressures of the compressors in both 
periods were very similar so no adjustments were made to the calculations. The measurements are as follows:
