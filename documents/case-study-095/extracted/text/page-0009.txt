Engineering Conclusions
Please note that the energy baseline period (Pre) and the avoided energy 
reporting period (Post) data was compiled when these systems were 
operating at full capacity (100%). Both Baseline and Post analysis reporting 
period energy measurements were repeated during the data gathering 
periods in the identical manner. The performance of the CRAC units is 
being affected by the HVAC facility design. Changing the duct work to 
allow the supply air from CRAC unit #2 to flow directly into the data 
center instead of being routed through CRAC unit #1 first will serve to 
further enhance the overall facility performance and reduce energy usage 
even more.
