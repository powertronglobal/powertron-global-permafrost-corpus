Determining the Payback Period
Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to determine an accurate Payback 
Period for Regional Cable Provider for implementing this ECM:
Baseline kW         1.92 kW/ton * 16 tons = 30.72 kW
Baseline Annual kWh         30.72 kW * 3,200 hours = 98,304 kWh
Baseline Annual Cost         98,304 kWh * .095 cents = $9,339
Regression Analysis is then used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Split System 
 
Adjusted Baseline Tonnage         20.3 tons (equates to tonnage in Post)
Adjusted kW Baseline         1.92 kW/ton * 20.3 tons = 38.98 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh         38.98 kW * 3,200 Annual Operating Hrs = 124,736 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline         124,736 kWh * $.095 = $11,850
kW Post         1.075 kW/ton * 20.3 tons = 21.82 kW
Annual kWh Post         21.82 kW * 3,200 hours = 69,824 kWh
Annual Cost Post         69,824 kWh * .095 cents = $6,633
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Month         ($11,850 - $6,633)/12 = $434.75
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed         $2,500 / $434.75 = 6 months
 
ROI = 6 months
