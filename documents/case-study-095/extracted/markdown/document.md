PermaFrost NMR® Eﬃciency Report

Regional Cable Provider - Data Center

May, 2013
Executive Summary

This report contains specific information   regarding the installation of the energy control measure

(ECM) PermaFrost NMR® in the two HVAC Computer room Air Conditioners (CRACs) serving the data

center at the Regional Cable Provider facility located at 2112 West Tilghman Street, Allentown, PA. Detailed forensic

performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on both of the nominal 20-ton CRAC units,

each outfitted with two compressors using R22 refrigerant. Following testing, the CRACs were treated with

the proper amount and type of the PermaFrost NMR® technology specially formulated for these types of

systems.  Measurement and Verification (M&V) was conducted pre-installation and post-gestation.

The improvement in efficiency and restored

capacity gained directly across both systems

was solely attributable to the PermaFrost

NMR® ECM. This is a result of the reversal of

thermal inefficiency on heat exchange surfaces, creating

greater efficiency in refrigerant approach and

the thermal energy transfer abilities of the

cooler and condenser vessels.

Following treatment with the PermaFrost

NMR® technology, the systems showed an

effective net average 41.4% reduction in

kW/ton based on the exact capacity measured

in the baseline M&V and the post gestation M&V. With each of the 20-ton CRACs operating at full load, the

systems showed an average 24.2% reduction in kW consumption while simultaneously producing an

increase in average capacity of 4.3 tons. This 31.9% average capacity increase from the baseline performance

levels produced an effective average increase in system efficiency of 31.9%, which directly correlates to what

Regional Cable Provider will realize in energy savings as they operate these systems in the future under the same parameters.

Driving these savings was an average 23.5% reduction in amp draw under full load conditions.

Following treatment with the PermaFrost NMR® technology, the systems also showed a substantial

31.9% average improvement in Enthalpy Delta, which is a critical HVAC measurement used to determine

the thermodynamic enhancement brought about by the PermaFrost NMR® ECM.  The result of the ECM

improvement is an ROI to Regional Cable Provider that is measured in months. The tables of data are available for review at

the end of this report. Financial calculations determining the true ROI are proprietary to Regional Cable Provider under

separate cover.

Product Brief

PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure

(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) technology as its core agent. A sustainable,

one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any

type of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and

equipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX);

chilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia

refrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The

equipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal

(single and multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.

The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and

improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point temperatures in a more

rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from the

enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW hours

used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced carbon footprint

for Regional Cable Provider.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol

The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) was utilized in the

development of this report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), The American Society of Heating,

Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization

(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation

methods and products.

There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They

are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Option B is

defined as: All parameter measurements with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as the single

source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the ECM

affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the baseline data.

Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the

savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term

measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by

short-term measurements of baseline and energy reporting period (post), and /or engineering computations

using measurements of proxies of energy use.

The final computation follows the formula:

Energy Science Division

Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy

+/ - Routine Adjustments +/ - Non-Routine Adjustments

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content

The content within the following report will demonstrate the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the

effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces.

A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the unit’s operational

conditions were satisfactory. Baseline M&V were recorded and then the proper amount and type of

PermaFrost NMR® was injected. The gestation period for the Regional Cable Provider pilot was six (6) weeks on these

particular CRACs to allow them each to achieve the required ~300 hours of runtime on each system to

ensure adequate performance improvement time. At the end of this gestation period, Post M&V results

were taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same or very similar

entering air temperatures and compressor discharge pressures. These are the two most critical

measurements affected by the weather. When analyzing the data, no adjustments for weather were

necessary.

The following report produces the utilization of the International Performance Measurement and

Verification Protocol (IPMVP) as the M&V plan. Mike Romanovitch and Jeff Stage from Regional Cable Provider witnessed the

collection of the data used in this report. The final calculations were performed by Powertron Global’s

Forensic Mechanical Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer].

The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:

kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase)

BTUH = CFM * 4.5 (standard air) * Calculated Enthalpy Delta

kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage

Percentage Eﬃciency = Measured BTUH / Manufacturers Design BTUH

Determining the Payback Period

Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following steps were taken to determine an accurate Payback

Period for Regional Cable Provider for implementing this ECM:

Baseline kW         1.92 kW/ton * 16 tons = 30.72 kW

Baseline Annual kWh         30.72 kW * 3,200 hours = 98,304 kWh

Baseline Annual Cost         98,304 kWh * .095 cents = $9,339

Regression Analysis is then used to account for amount of tonnage restored to Split System

Adjusted Baseline Tonnage         20.3 tons (equates to tonnage in Post)

Adjusted kW Baseline         1.92 kW/ton * 20.3 tons = 38.98 kW

Adjusted Baseline kWh         38.98 kW * 3,200 Annual Operating Hrs = 124,736 kWh

Revised Cost to Run Baseline         124,736 kWh * $.095 = $11,850

kW Post         1.075 kW/ton * 20.3 tons = 21.82 kW

Annual kWh Post         21.82 kW * 3,200 hours = 69,824 kWh

Annual Cost Post         69,824 kWh * .095 cents = $6,633

Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Month         ($11,850 - $6,633)/12 = $434.75

Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed         $2,500 / $434.75 = 6 months

ROI = 6 months

Engineering Conclusions

Please note that the energy baseline period (Pre) and the avoided energy

reporting period (Post) data was compiled when these systems were

operating at full capacity (100%). Both Baseline and Post analysis reporting

period energy measurements were repeated during the data gathering

periods in the identical manner. The performance of the CRAC units is

being affected by the HVAC facility design. Changing the duct work to

allow the supply air from CRAC unit #2 to flow directly into the data

center instead of being routed through CRAC unit #1 first will serve to

further enhance the overall facility performance and reduce energy usage

even more.
