A. Executive Summary 
 
The purpose of this study is to compare and confirm the test results of AHRI 
Standards efficiency testing at Underwriters Laboratories, Inc (UL) of PermaFrost 
NMR® to verify results under field conditions at 10 cell tower sites in Houston, 
Texas.   
PermaFrost NMR® is an efficiency restoration chemical that treats the surface of 
metal. It works the same way on every air conditioner, every time.  Measuring the 
performance accurately is based on measuring expected variables and the 
mitigation of uncontrolled variables, so forensic based standards field testing 
should be in line with laboratory testing due to the chemical nature of the 
technology.   Major Telecom E requested expanding the testing parameters to include energy 
use (runtime) under the same weather conditions (where possible) to determine 
energy savings in situ. Twenty units generated a large enough sample size to help 
account for uncontrolled variables with a high level of confidence.  Together, these 
methodologies should help to create additional confidence in the data. 
1. Average kWh savings of 19.4% achieved in field testing across all sites is 
comparable to the 18% - 22% efficiency gains found in controlled AHRI lab 
testing by UL (Gold Standard of the HVAC industry). 
2. Runtime was reduced by 18,818 minutes or 18.3% matching UL controlled test 
results. 
3. Weather conditions (temperature data) in the post were slightly warmer. 
Cooling Degree Days (CDDs) in the post were within .2% of baseline. This 
small amount of additional work was overcome providing high confidence in 
the data sets with respect to weather conditions.  
4. Eight of the ten sites had comparable runtime data sets. Two sites required a 
regression analysis (blue) due to mechanical issues in a couple of units 
(normal) affecting runtimes. The independent kWh and runtime savings 
matched the EER and kW/ton improvements.  
5. Runtime reduction equates to a ~19% equipment life extension and 
maintenance expense reduction. 
6. The forensic study data in this pilot can be used by Major Telecom E to cut additional 
expenses outside of the focus of this pilot.  Powertron engineers and data staff 
have uncovered opportunities in equipment, service, and operational protocols 
that can be leveraged if desired.    
 
B. Introduction 
 
A selection of twenty (20) consecutive days prior to the implementation of 
PermaFrost NMR® is compared to twenty (20) consecutive days in the Energy 
Reporting Period (ERP) or post period. The Energy Reporting Period was selected 
after ample time was allowed for the treated Bard units to have gestated as 
determined by measuring each units compressor run time after the 
nanotechnology had been installed.

Powertron Global’s digital F2 monitoring systems were installed on each individual 
HVAC unit (2 per site) at ten (10) selected cell tower building sites (Appendix A). 
The measurement boundary will be the HVAC equipment itself. The F2 devices 
recorded data every second on a continual basis. The data is automatically 
uploaded to Powertron’s FMV data gathering platform. Each F2 device is 
equipped with a revenue grade power meter and specific levels of sensor 
technology including a variety of temperature, humidity, airflow, and current 
measurements (compressor on/off) capabilities. The list of points measured can 
be found within Appendix B in this report. All measurements were collected to 
provide the establishment of a confident baseline power consumption and thermal 
performance as determined by the use of temperature data (CDD). The F2 
systems remained attached to the equipment throughout the entire project. 
 
After baseline data was established, a total of twenty (20) HVAC units were 
treated with the proper amount of PermaFrost NMR®, a nanotechnical chemical, 
designed to restore any lost cooling capacity because of internal heat exchanger 
lubricant fouling. The goal of the technology is to restore lost efficiency, enhance 
cooling capacity from depleted levels, and to reduce compressor runtime/cycle 
time periods.  
 
Accomplishing the deliverance of additional cooling capacity by improving heat 
exchanger performance will reduce the amount of time the compressor must 
operate therefore reducing the amount of total kilowatt hours consumed on a daily 
basis.   
 
After treatment and required time for the nanotechnology to gestate (up to 500 
compressor runtime hours) throughout the refrigeration circuit of each unit, the 
ERP or post data gathering was recorded. The ERP data will be compared to the 
baseline power data taking into account the CDD totals to normalize the results. 
 
 
C. Project Description 
 
The initial baseline period was conducted on May 11-24 of 2023 but due to the 
delayed installation of the product, Powertron Global F2 devices captured 
additional 6 weeks approximately of baseline data (May 25 – July 4). A pivot in the 
selection of the baseline data period was determined to compare pre & post data 
sets with the exact or near exact Cooling Degree Day (CDD) totals for like weather 
conditions. Another important static factor that influenced the data selection was to 
include an even number of lead and lag days in both data sets. The Lead/Lag 
settings on the controllers are set for 1 day allowing the units to alternate each day 
as the lead.  
 
Powertron was able to use a more compelling and comparable baseline period 
with external load temperatures and additional days of exposure (data). This year 
in Texas the spring temperatures were unseasonably cool followed by above

average summer temps occurring in the [Texas City] area. Expanding the 
baseline and post periods to allow for ideal weather comparisons provides higher 
confidence in the data. 
 
The installation of PermaFrost NMR occurred on July 5-6, 2023. Immediately after 
the installation the Bard thermostat controllers were lowered in each tower sites 
building and allowed to run for approximately thirty (30) days uninterrupted to 
speed up the gestation time required for the nanotechnology to seat itself into the 
metal surfaces of each unit. The data collected during this period will not be used 
in any analysis. The thermostat controllers were returned to the normal operating 
settings of 80-degree set point on August 7, 2023. Further gestation was required 
at normal operating conditions in order to produce a proper post data set.  
 
The Energy Reporting Period (ERP) was from September 6 to October 3, 2023. 
Twenty (20) consecutive days are used in the post-period to simulate weather 
conditions following product gestation. 
 
D. ECM Description 
 
As PermaFrost NMR nanotechnology (interior coil surface treatment) is installed 
into a sealed vapor compression system (Package HVAC Unit), a molecular 
transformation develops. This transformation displaces layers of lubricating fluids 
that have been impinged in the evaporator and condenser heat exchanger metal 
surfaces. When the fluid is displaced, the evaporator and condenser can transfer 
additional heat energy through the tube walls (thermal restoration). This enables 
the evaporator to completely dehumidify the air per the unit’s design specifications.  
When more dehumidification is developed, the enthalpy delta is increased. This is 
the action that increases thermal performance through heat exchanger restoration. 
 
 
As the capacity increases, the kW/ton decreases by means of mathematical 
function, demonstrating PermaFrost NMR’s post-treatment effect lowering the 
electrical cost of every ton of cooling produced, no matter how many tons are called 
for at any given time.  
  
PermaFrost NMR does not change or alter any unit’s electrical characteristics. This 
change of performance is purely thermal in nature. 
 
 
E. Measurement & Verification 
 
The primary objective is to measure the complete power use by each HVAC unit 
utilizing revenue grade power meters directly connected to each unit to measure 
power consumption during both Baseline and Energy Reporting Periods. 
Measuring overall power consumed by an HVAC system can be realized by 
measuring voltage, amperage and power factor. Parameters were measured 
continuously every second during all hours for a period of twenty (20) days to 
develop a baseline. The outdoor air temperature sensors are mounted near each 
HVAC unit to quantify the number of CDDs each unit experienced during the data-

collecting periods. 
 
The supplemental objective of measuring the overall cooling production of HVAC 
systems can be realized by measuring the total energy consumed by the specific 
unit being tested and the total BTUH production of the system then calculating 
these parameters to obtain current capacity, kW/ton, EER (energy efficient ratio) 
and COP (coefficient of performance). Using that information the total BTUH of 
cooling production can be realized.  
 
For these HVAC systems, parameters were measured continuously every second 
during all hours for a period of twenty (20) days to develop a scientific baseline. 
The outdoor air temperature entering the air-cooled condenser coils of each unit 
will affect the design capacity. An analysis is provided of the twenty (20) day 
period of performance profiles of subsequent kW/ton, EER and COP across a 
variation of outdoor air temperatures spanning a twenty-five (25) degree span 
(75ºF-100ºF). 
 
Total BTUH was developed along with total kW consumption by measuring all 
required data points and entering them into industry best practice engineering 
formulae. All measurement hardware was certified under NIST or CE standards. 
Engineering formulae was developed by AHRI / ASHRAE (American Heating and 
Refrigeration Institute / American Society of Heating Refrigeration & Air 
Conditioning Engineers): 
 
Kilo-watt (kW) = Volts (V) x Amps (A) x Power Factor (PF) / 1000 
British Thermal Units (BTU) = CFM x 4.5 x Enthalpy Delta  
Capacity / Tons = BTU / 12,000 
Kilo-watt per Ton (kW/Ton) = kW Energy / Tons (capacity) 
Co-Efficient of Performance (COP) = 12/kW per ton/ 3.412 
Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) = BTU / Watts 
 
 
F. Baseline Period Energy and Conditions 
Baseline dates varied slightly for each unit due to CDD selections measured by 
onsite outdoor air temp sensors as to compare exact or near exact data sets in 
post in respect to CDD totals. Generally, the dates occurred between May 31 – 
June 25. Operating hours for these cell huts are 24/7 365 days a year. Each 
individual units baseline dates can be found later in this report. Each hut was 
allowed to operate as normal without interruption. Thermostat settings were static 
and left alone during both the Baseline and Energy Reporting Periods. Internally 
generated heat produced by Major Telecom E servers and antennas varied from hut to hut 
but were considered static in both Baseline and ERP.

G. Energy Reporting Period and Conditions 
 
Energy reporting period dates is from Sept 6 – 25 except for Nodes 513 & 514 
(Sept 11-Oct 3 range) due to the matching of like weather data sets (20 
consecutive days each set). All conditions were left the same as in the baseline 
period. No adjustments were made. Specific data for each unit’s data set can be 
found in Appendix D.

The weather difference in this study between the two periods is negligible (.2% difference on average) and 
in some cases warmer in the post period therefore no weather regression analysis will be performed for this 
independent variable. These huts are unmanned with no windows and secured.

L. Accounting for Uncontrolled Variables using Industry Standards 
 
Cell Hut #1 has the most internally generated heat of cell site in this project. It 
contains approx. 20 antennas along with other standard equipment that give off 
significant amounts of heat. Network usage traffic here likely plays a significant roll 
in HVAC usage even more than outdoor air temps.  
• Node 508 had a leak in the baseline which was reported for repair prior to 
baseline ERP.  The unit steadily declined in performance and in the 
baseline and into the post.  Efficiency was improved but the runtime data is 
unreliable.  We did calculate the avoided energy savings in the regression 
from efficiency improvements in the site. 
 
 
• Node 507 showed an unexplained improvement in output during the 
extended baseline period that showed a 4-ton unit outputting over 5 tons.  
However baseline data prior to the change gives us reliable data to 
calculate savings by kW/ton reduction. Regression analysis accounted for 
PermaFrost NMR improvements and removed the influence due to the 
output anomaly.  The energy use was improved 20.5% (adjusted down from 
52% output anomaly)

Cell Hut #2 located at Benfer Rd. 
Node 509 (HVAC #1) & 510 (HVAC #2) demonstrated some anomalous HVAC 
controls behavior in respect to their lead/lag schedule. It is most likely a controls 
issue or malfunction that did not permit comparable runtime data.    Industry 
standards data showed efficiency improvement which matched the data in larger 
sample of sites.  
 
a. Unit 2 is a 3-ton system that was not allowed to run much in the post. 
This malfunction showed a false positive decrease in runtime which 
overstated the reduction. The unit ran every other day as normal during 
the baseline but did not operate that way in the post. Please see 
Appendix E.

b. Unit 1 is a 5-ton system that was forced to run in place of unit 2 in the 
post.  This unit is much larger and consumes almost twice the kW while 
running, but we can still calculate the savings due to running it at a 
much higher efficiency.  These two units used 23.25 % less energy than 
the baseline consumption.

Cell Hut #7 located at 7167-7133 Nelms St. 
Powertron Global discovered that HVAC #1 (node 519) has an ongoing issue that 
prevented it from running properly in the Baseline and in the ERP. It is currently 
still malfunctioning. It was fixed back in late July but soon malfunctioned again 
around September 1st due to the compressor energizing briefly but then defaults to 
the evaporator fan only running as if it was in a fan mode. This condition was 
witnessed and reported to Major Telecom E prior to the installation of the PermaFrost NMR.  
• The other unit (node 520) handled the entire workload (as planned) and 
exhibited runtime and kWh savings as well energy efficiency improvements 
in the unit. While operating alone, the unit saved 29.1% kwh and runtime. 
Below are the efficiency improvements for reference. 
 
 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
We are pleased to conclude that this study confirmed energy savings of +19% and 
these results fell directly in line with the 18-22% results in UL Laboratory testing. 
The forensic approach showed comprehensive data accounting for uncontrolled 
variables and normal rates of equipment failure. This methodology combined with 
kWh use and weather (degrees), provides an accurate savings measurement 
when variable interference and comparable data was not available or unreliable.  
The complete data set supports the testing requirements of Major Telecom E, AHRI, UL, and 
Powertron Global while allowing more accurate modeling results in diverse 
conditions across a national portfolio.
