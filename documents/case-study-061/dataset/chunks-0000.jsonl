Detailed forensic performance testing \n(outlined later in this report) was performed on 8 DX units ranging from 15 to 40 tons in size. It was \ndetermined to demonstrate the performance of the product in both administrative and branch type \nbuildings.\nImmediately following the baseline testing, all the units were treated with the proper amount and type of \nPermaFrost NMR® product formulated for R-22 DX and R-438A systems. Since there were no other ECM’s \ngoing on during this pilot project, the improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at the \nunits is solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. The unit(s) now provide cooler/drier supply air \nwhile using less power. This greater operational efficiency is due to the restoration of the heat transfer \nability of the evaporator and condenser coils.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.\n\n\n\nProduct Brief\n         PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure \n(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, \none-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any \ntype of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and \nequipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX); \nchilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia \nrefrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The \nequipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single \nand multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.\nThe direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and \nimproved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point temperatures in a more \nrapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from the \nenhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW hours \nused, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced carbon footprint \nfor International Bank A.\nEnergy Science Division\nBOUNDARY LAYER\nOIL REMOVED\nBEFORE TREATMENT\nAFTER TREATMENT\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 794, "chars": 3716, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_061_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:ff14039be62bd2d94aeeaf837b225543687282aaa214c88098c0e7fc1a6dd748"}

The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating, \nRefrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization \n(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation \nmethods and products.\nThere are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They \nare options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Retrofit Isolation \n(Option B) is defined as: All parameter measurement with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as \nthe single source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the \nenergy conservation method affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the \nbaseline data.\nMeasurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the \nsavings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term \nmeasurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by \nshort-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using \nmeasurements of proxies of energy use.\nThe final computation follows the formula:\nEnergy Science Division\nOption B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy\n+ - Routine adjustments / + - Non-Routine Adjustments\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 477, "chars": 2347, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_061_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_061_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:730539913a8394a29437bf28aa14dcc3b5be876d49ef35ca996c3194f3845fb3"}

A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment is \nimplemented to determine if the unit’s operational conditions are satisfactory. Baseline measurements were  \nrecorded and then the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected. The product was \nallowed 4 weeks to seat itself into the metal surfaces. At the end of this gestation period, Post M&V results \nwere taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same or very similar \nentering air temperatures and compressor discharge pressures. These are the two most critical \nmeasurements affected by the weather. Some units in this report required normalization due to weather.\nThe following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP International Performance Measurement and \nVerification Protocol as the M&V plan. The final calculations and measurements were performed by \nPowertron Global’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer] and the equipment analysis and \nproduct installation was overseen, conducted and verified with International Bank A employees Mr. [Bank Representative] and Mr. \n[Bank Representative].\nThe results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:\n \n \nkW= Volts X Amps * 1.47 Three Phase / 1000\n \n \nBtuh Capacity = Measured CFM X 4.5 * Calculated Enthalpy Delta \n \n \nSystem Eﬃciency % = Actual Coil Capacity Btuh / Nominal Coil Capacity Btuh\n \n \nkW per Ton = Measured kW / Measured Tons\n \n \nCOP = 12 / kW per ton / 3.412\n \nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 518, "chars": 2359, "pages": {"start": 4, "end": 5}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_061_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_061_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:082c7c500ad82a52535424396dca24493f5e7a72b08d8eb91c181cf367b28db3"}

F) entering the coil was matched exactly to the baseline period. \nAfter matching this temperature the post readings were taken to ensure that the work the coil had to do was \njust like in the baseline. The post amperage was also normalized for the entering condenser water and the \nOAT differences. The entering condenser tower water and the outdoor air temperature were both 3.45% \nwarmer.\n**Please note that the design entering condenser water temperatures for this equipment as recorded during the baseline \nand avoided energy reporting periods were not in accordance with design. This accounts for increased capacity over \ndesign as detailed in the calculated analysis of the measured and verified data for both the baseline and the avoided \nenergy reporting periods.

The conditions during this M&V procedures were less than the design parameters, which \naccounted for the capacities well above design even before the ECM PermaFrost NMR® was installed. \nThese conditions were present in both baseline and post (Energy Reporting Period) periods therefore the \nimprovements PermaFrost NMR® brought about are sound and scientifically verified.\nThe runtime and electric energy cost (0,43R$ with all Brazilian taxes) was informed by [Bank Representative]  (from Branches department) and [Bank Representative] (for Administrative department) and moreover that \nconsideration was taken in the equipments 60% of the total runtime only.\nThe total cost of PermaFrost NMR® was calculated based on the price with all the Brazilian taxation, as well \nas, trading company costs included which reached out the value per unit of $ 205,8USD.\nFollowing the treatment of PermaFrost NMR®, the installed units (8) showed a substantial reduction in \nWatts/energy of 47.1%, the average improvement in COP was 44.7%, the average overall system efficiency \nand Btuh capacity improvements were 38.0% and the total restored capacity was 54.5 tons.\nIn conclusion, regarding the ECO efficient/sustainable respect to this project International Bank A saved the \nenvironment 149 metric tons of green house gas emissions -carbon dioxide- as well as saved 210,592 kWh of \npower.\nEnergy Science Division\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 489, "chars": 2258, "pages": {"start": 37, "end": 38}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_061_chunk_0023", "next_id": "pdf_061_chunk_0025", "content_hash": "sha256:b3c8563a310e8854a83583b68c0fb8f33b655a7bdc402fe4d7b7a9cac221d23f"}
