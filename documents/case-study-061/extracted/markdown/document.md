PermaFrost NMR® Performance Report

International Bank A

June 12, 2013

Executive Summary

This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure

(ECM) PermaFrost NMR® in [Brazil Location] for International Bank A. Detailed forensic performance testing

(outlined later in this report) was performed on 8 DX units ranging from 15 to 40 tons in size. It was

determined to demonstrate the performance of the product in both administrative and branch type

buildings.

Immediately following the baseline testing, all the units were treated with the proper amount and type of

PermaFrost NMR® product formulated for R-22 DX and R-438A systems. Since there were no other ECM’s

going on during this pilot project, the improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at the

units is solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. The unit(s) now provide cooler/drier supply air

while using less power. This greater operational efficiency is due to the restoration of the heat transfer

ability of the evaporator and condenser coils.

Product Brief

PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented nanotechnology surface chemistry Energy Control Measure

(ECM) that uses Nucleo Molecular Regenerative (NMR) technology as its core agent. A sustainable,

one-time treatment with no down time required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any

type of system in which it is installed. Examples of the types of commercial HVACR systems and

equipment that PermaFrost NMR® has proven success with are direct expansion air systems (DX);

chilled water systems (both flooded and DX; air and water cooled); ice making equipment; ammonia

refrigeration plants (single compressor and cascade) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) designs. The

equipment utilized in these systems within our expanding portfolio of clients includes centrifugal (single

and multi-stage), scroll, reciprocating and screw configurations.

The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling performance, increased capacity and

improved refrigerant velocity – all of which allow systems to achieve set point temperatures in a more

rapid fashion which reduces compressor operating periods. The indirect benefits resulting from the

enhanced thermodynamic characteristics following treatment include reduced run time, less kW hours

used, less amp draw at the compressor, longer equipment life cycle time and a reduced carbon footprint

for International Bank A.

Measurement and Veriﬁcation Protocol

The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) was utilized in the

development of this report. The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE), American Society of Heating,

Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and The Efficiency Valuation Organization

(EVO) accept the IPMVP as a global methodology for determining the effectiveness of energy conservation

methods and products.

There are four distinct options in the IPMVP protocol for energy conservation professionals to utilize. They

are options A, B, C and D.  Retrofit Isolation (Option B) was the option used for this report. Retrofit Isolation

(Option B) is defined as: All parameter measurement with the boundary of the ECM (PermaFrost NMR®) as

the single source of measurement. Savings are determined by field measurement of the energy use of the

energy conservation method affected equipment or system and any performance enhancements versus the

baseline data.

Measurement frequency ranges from short term to continuous, depending on the expected variations in the

savings and the length of the reporting period.  For the boundary utilized for Option B short-term

measurements are very useful as data when the variables are contained. The savings are calculated by

short-term measurements of baseline and reporting period energy, and /or engineering computations using

measurements of proxies of energy use.

The final computation follows the formula:

Energy Science Division

Option B savings = Baseline Energy – Reporting Period Energy

+ - Routine adjustments / + - Non-Routine Adjustments

Energy Conservation Method (ECM) Content

The content of the following report will demonstrate the effects of PermaFrost NMR®’s ability to correct the

effects of thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces.

It was determined with International Bank A to treat 8 DX units. A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment is

implemented to determine if the unit’s operational conditions are satisfactory. Baseline measurements were

recorded and then the proper amount and type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected. The product was

allowed 4 weeks to seat itself into the metal surfaces. At the end of this gestation period, Post M&V results

were taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match the same or very similar

entering air temperatures and compressor discharge pressures. These are the two most critical

measurements affected by the weather. Some units in this report required normalization due to weather.

The following report produces the utilization of the IPMVP International Performance Measurement and

Verification Protocol as the M&V plan. The final calculations and measurements were performed by

Powertron Global’s Forensic Mechanical Engineer, [Senior Energy Engineer] and the equipment analysis and

product installation was overseen, conducted and verified with International Bank A employees Mr. [Bank Representative] and Mr.

[Bank Representative].

The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:

kW= Volts X Amps * 1.47 Three Phase / 1000

Btuh Capacity = Measured CFM X 4.5 * Calculated Enthalpy Delta

System Eﬃciency % = Actual Coil Capacity Btuh / Nominal Coil Capacity Btuh

kW per Ton = Measured kW / Measured Tons

COP = 12 / kW per ton / 3.412

Baseline & Energy Reporting (Post) Periods

The baseline data was recorded on 4/9/13 using NIST calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy.

The following results were recorded as a result of the implementation of the IPMVP Protocol. The identical

IPMVP data recordings from the baseline were recorded on 5/21/13 using the same NIST calibrated devices

to insure measurement accuracy. The Energy Reporting Period measurements are as follows:

It was discovered that the Bitzer package unit #1 was low on refrigerant. It was evident that this unit had a

leak(s). 10 lbs of R-22 gas was added to the unit in the post trip. The unit certainly showed significant

improvements but the unit did not get the full exposure of PF due to this leak(s).

The post DB temperature (72 deg. F) entering the coil was matched exactly to the baseline period. After

matching this temperature the post readings were taken to ensure that the work the coil had to do was as

close as possible to the baseline. The post amperage was also normalized for the OAT difference. The OAT

or outdoor air temperature was 5.33% or 4 degrees F higher in the Energy Reporting Period (post).

**Please note that the design entering condenser water temperatures for this equipment as recorded during the baseline

and avoided energy reporting periods were not in accordance with design. This accounts for increased capacity over

design as detailed in the calculated analysis of the measured and verified data for both the baseline and the avoided

energy reporting periods. Please see the Conclusion/Notes at the end of the report for further details.

Period (post). The Bitzer package unit #3 did not show maximum results because when we performed a

survey of the overall operating performance of the unit he noticed it was low on refrigerant indicating a

significant leak(s). The team installed 30 lbs of R-22 before the baseline was performed. PermaFrost NMR®

was then installed. Upon return, to do the post analysis approximately 4 weeks later, more refrigerant had

leaked out again. We had to install another 10 lbs of R-22 so in one month there was a notable release of

refrigerant. The unit certainly showed significant improvements but the unit did not get the full exposure of

PermaFrost NMR® due to this leak(s).

The post DB temperature (74.8 vs. 74 deg. F) entering the coil was matched as close as possible to the

baseline period. After matching this temperature the post readings were taken to ensure that the work the

coil had to do was as similar to the baseline. Normalization of the post amperage in this case was not

performed due to the OAT in the Energy Reporting Period was only 1.83 % or 1.4 degrees F.

**Please note that the design entering condenser water temperatures for this equipment as recorded during the baseline

and avoided energy reporting periods were not in accordance with design. This accounts for increased capacity over

design as detailed in the calculated analysis of the measured and verified data for both the baseline and the avoided

energy reporting periods. Please see the Conclusion/Notes at the end of the report for further details.

The post DB temperature (73 vs. 73 deg. F) entering the coil was matched exactly to the baseline period.

After matching this temperature the post readings were taken to ensure that the work the coil had to do was

just like in the baseline. The post amperage was also normalized for the entering condenser water and the

OAT differences. The entering condenser tower water and the outdoor air temperature were both 3.45%

warmer.

Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following performance measurements were placed into the

regression analysis to account for the restored capacity brought about by PermaFrost NMR® and to

determine an accurate ROI for implementing this ECM:.

Regression Analysis

Adjusted Base Tonnage         38.55 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)

Adjusted Total Watts         782 Watts per Ton * 38.55 tons = 30,146.1 Watts

Adjusted Base kWh         (30,146.1 Watts /1,000) * 5,256 Annual Operating hrs = 158,447 kWh

Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM         158,447 kWh * $.2098 = $33,242.26 USD

Post ECM kWh         (21,909.7 Watts / 1,000) * 5,256 Annual Operating hrs = 115,159 kWh

Cost to Run After ECM         115,159 kWh * $.2098 = $24,160.02

Cost Savings per Year         ($33,242.26 - $24,160.02) = $9,082.24 USD

Cost of PermaFrost NMR® $6,174 USD

KwH Saving per Year         ($158,447 - 115,159) = 43,288 kWh

Environmental Impact of the Project         * 30.5 metric ton reduction of carbons dioxide emissions

*Emission factor calculated by 7.055 x 10 to the negative 4 metric tons Co2/KwH

The DB temperature (73 vs. 73.2 deg. F) entering the coil was matched as close as possible to the baseline

period. After matching this temperature the post readings were taken to ensure that the work the coil had to

do was as similar to the baseline. The amperage was also normalized for the OAT difference. The OAT or

outdoor air temperature was 20.59% or 14 degrees F higher in the Energy Reporting Period (post).

**Please note that the design entering condenser water temperatures for this equipment as recorded during the baseline

and avoided energy reporting periods were not in accordance with design. This accounts for increased capacity over

design as detailed in the calculated analysis of the measured and verified data for both the baseline and the avoided

energy reporting periods. Please see the Conclusion/Notes at the end of the report for further details.

Conclusion / Notes

The nominal capacity for the HVAC units in this report were determined by the manufacturer at the

conditions of incoming condenser water at 85 degree F and entering evaporator air temperature of 80

degrees F. The conditions during this M&V procedures were less than the design parameters, which

accounted for the capacities well above design even before the ECM PermaFrost NMR® was installed.

These conditions were present in both baseline and post (Energy Reporting Period) periods therefore the

improvements PermaFrost NMR® brought about are sound and scientifically verified.

The runtime and electric energy cost (0,43R$ with all Brazilian taxes) was informed by [Bank Representative]

(from Branches department) and [Bank Representative] (for Administrative department) and moreover that

consideration was taken in the equipments 60% of the total runtime only.

The total cost of PermaFrost NMR® was calculated based on the price with all the Brazilian taxation, as well

as, trading company costs included which reached out the value per unit of $ 205,8USD.

Following the treatment of PermaFrost NMR®, the installed units (8) showed a substantial reduction in

Watts/energy of 47.1%, the average improvement in COP was 44.7%, the average overall system efficiency

and Btuh capacity improvements were 38.0% and the total restored capacity was 54.5 tons.

In conclusion, regarding the ECO efficient/sustainable respect to this project International Bank A saved the

environment 149 metric tons of green house gas emissions -carbon dioxide- as well as saved 210,592 kWh of

power.
