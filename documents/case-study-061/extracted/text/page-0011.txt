The post DB temperature (72 vs. 72.7 deg. F) entering the coil was matched as close as possible to the 
baseline period. After matching this temperature the post readings were taken to ensure that the work the 
coil had to do was as similar to the baseline. The post amperage was also normalized for the OAT 
difference. The OAT or outdoor air temperature was 5.33% or 4 degrees F higher in the Energy Reporting 
Period (post).
**Please note that the design entering condenser water temperatures for this equipment as recorded during the baseline 
and avoided energy reporting periods were not in accordance with design. This accounts for increased capacity over 
design as detailed in the calculated analysis of the measured and verified data for both the baseline and the avoided 
energy reporting periods. Please see the Conclusion/Notes at the end of the report for further details.
