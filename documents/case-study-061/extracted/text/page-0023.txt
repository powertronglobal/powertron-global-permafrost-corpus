The post DB temperature (73 vs. 73 deg. F) entering the coil was matched exactly to the baseline period. 
After matching this temperature the post readings were taken to ensure that the work the coil had to do was 
just like in the baseline. The post amperage was also normalized for the entering condenser water and the 
OAT differences. The entering condenser tower water and the outdoor air temperature were both 3.45% 
warmer.
**Please note that the design entering condenser water temperatures for this equipment as recorded during the baseline 
and avoided energy reporting periods were not in accordance with design. This accounts for increased capacity over 
design as detailed in the calculated analysis of the measured and verified data for both the baseline and the avoided 
energy reporting periods. Please see the Conclusion/Notes at the end of the report for further details.
