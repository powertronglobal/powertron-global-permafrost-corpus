Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following performance measurements were placed into the 
regression analysis to account for the restored capacity brought about by PermaFrost NMR® and to 
determine an accurate ROI for implementing this ECM:.
Regression Analysis 
Adjusted Base Tonnage         38.55 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted Total Watts         782 Watts per Ton * 38.55 tons = 30,146.1 Watts
Adjusted Base kWh         (30,146.1 Watts /1,000) * 5,256 Annual Operating hrs = 158,447 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM         158,447 kWh * $.2098 = $33,242.26 USD
Post ECM kWh         (21,909.7 Watts / 1,000) * 5,256 Annual Operating hrs = 115,159 kWh
Cost to Run After ECM         115,159 kWh * $.2098 = $24,160.02
Cost Savings per Year         ($33,242.26 - $24,160.02) = $9,082.24 USD
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® $6,174 USD
KwH Saving per Year         ($158,447 - 115,159) = 43,288 kWh
Environmental Impact of the Project         * 30.5 metric ton reduction of carbons dioxide emissions
*Emission factor calculated by 7.055 x 10 to the negative 4 metric tons Co2/KwH
