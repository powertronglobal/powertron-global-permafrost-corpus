Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following performance measurements were placed into the 
regression analysis to account for the restored capacity brought about by PermaFrost NMR® and to 
determine an accurate ROI for implementing this ECM:.
Regression Analysis 
Adjusted Base Tonnage         17.31 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted Total Watts         1,121 Watts per Ton * 17.31 tons = 19,393.8 Total Watts
Adjusted Base kWh         (19,393.8 Watts /1,000) * 1,482 Annual Operating hrs = 28,742 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM         28,742 kWh * $.2098 = $6029.74 USD
Post ECM kWh         (17,294.6 Watts /1,000) * 1,482 Annual Operating hrs = 25,631 kWh
Cost to Run After ECM         25,631 kWh * $.2098 = $5,377.30 USD
Cost Savings per Year         ($6029.74 - $5,377.30) = $652.44 USD
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® $3,087 USD
KwH Saving per Year         ($28,742 - 25,631) = 3,111 kWh
Environmental Impact of the Project         * 2.2 metric ton reduction of carbons dioxide emissions
*Emission factor calculated by 7.055 x 10 to the negative 4 metric tons Co2/KwH
