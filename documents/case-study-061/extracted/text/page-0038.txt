Conclusion / Notes
The nominal capacity for the HVAC units in this report were determined by the manufacturer at the 
conditions of incoming condenser water at 85 degree F and entering evaporator air temperature of 80 
degrees F. The conditions during this M&V procedures were less than the design parameters, which 
accounted for the capacities well above design even before the ECM PermaFrost NMR® was installed. 
These conditions were present in both baseline and post (Energy Reporting Period) periods therefore the 
improvements PermaFrost NMR® brought about are sound and scientifically verified.
The runtime and electric energy cost (0,43R$ with all Brazilian taxes) was informed by [Bank Representative] 
(from Branches department) and [Bank Representative] (for Administrative department) and moreover that 
consideration was taken in the equipments 60% of the total runtime only.
The total cost of PermaFrost NMR® was calculated based on the price with all the Brazilian taxation, as well 
as, trading company costs included which reached out the value per unit of $ 205,8USD.
Following the treatment of PermaFrost NMR®, the installed units (8) showed a substantial reduction in 
Watts/energy of 47.1%, the average improvement in COP was 44.7%, the average overall system efficiency 
and Btuh capacity improvements were 38.0% and the total restored capacity was 54.5 tons.
In conclusion, regarding the ECO efficient/sustainable respect to this project International Bank A saved the 
environment 149 metric tons of green house gas emissions -carbon dioxide- as well as saved 210,592 kWh of 
power.
