Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following performance measurements were placed into the 
regression analysis to account for the restored capacity brought about by PermaFrost NMR® and to 
determine an accurate ROI for implementing this ECM:.
Regression Analysis 
Adjusted Base Tonnage         16.52 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted Total Watts         1,122 Watts per Ton * 16.52 tons = 18,535.4 Total Watts
Adjusted Base kWh         (18,535.4 Watts /1,000) * 1,482 Annual Operating hrs = 27,469 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM         27,469 kWh * $.2098 = $5,762.97 USD
Post ECM kWh         (16,064.4 Watts /1,000) * 1,482 Annual Operating hrs = 23,807 kWh
Cost to Run After ECM         23,897 kWh * $.2098 = $4,994.80 USD
Cost Savings per Year         ($5,762.97 - $4,994.80) = $768.17 USD
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® $3,087 USD
KwH Saving per Year         ($27,469 - 23,870) = 3,662 kWh
Environmental Impact of the Project         * 2.6 metric ton reduction of carbons dioxide emissions
*Emission factor calculated by 7.055 x 10 to the negative 4 metric tons Co2/KwH
