Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following performance measurements were placed into the 
regression analysis to account for the restored capacity brought about by PermaFrost NMR® and to 
determine an accurate ROI for implementing this ECM:.
Regression Analysis 
Adjusted Base Tonnage         24.48 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted Total Watts         860 Watts per Ton * 24.48 tons = 21,052.8 Total Watts
Adjusted Base kWh         (21,052.8 Watts /1,000) * 1,482 Annual Operating hrs = 31,201 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM         31,201 kWh * $.2098 = $6,545.87 USD
Post ECM kWh         (14,367.3 Watts /1,000) * 1,482 Annual Operating hrs = 21,292 kWh
Cost to Run After ECM         21,292 kWh * $.2098 = $4,467.04 USD
Cost Savings per Year         ($6,545.87 - $4,467.04) = $2,078.83 USD
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® $4,116 USD
KwH Saving per Year         ($31,201 - 21,292) = 9,909 kWh
Environmental Impact of the Project         * 7.0 metric ton reduction of carbons dioxide emissions
*Emission factor calculated by 7.055 x 10 to the negative 4 metric tons Co2/KwH
