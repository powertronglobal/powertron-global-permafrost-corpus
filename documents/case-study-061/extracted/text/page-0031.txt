The DB temperature (74.7 vs. 75.2 deg. F) entering the coil was matched as close as possible to the baseline 
period. After matching this temperature the post readings were taken to ensure that the work the coil had to 
do was as similar to the baseline. The OAT and entering condenser water in the post were negligible 
therefore no adjustments.
**Please note that the design entering condenser water temperatures for this equipment as recorded during the baseline 
and avoided energy reporting periods were not in accordance with design. This accounts for increased capacity over 
design as detailed in the calculated analysis of the measured and verified data for both the baseline and the avoided 
energy reporting periods. Please see the Conclusion/Notes at the end of the report for further details.
