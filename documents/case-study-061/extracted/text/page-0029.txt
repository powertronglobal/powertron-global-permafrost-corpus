Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following performance measurements were placed into the 
regression analysis to account for the restored capacity brought about by PermaFrost NMR® and to 
determine an accurate ROI for implementing this ECM:.
Regression Analysis 
Adjusted Base Tonnage         42.03 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted Total Watts         799 Watts per Ton * 42.03 tons = 33,582 Total Watts
Adjusted Base kWh         (33,582 Watts /1,000) * 5,256 Annual Operating hrs = 176,506 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM         176,506 kWh * $.2098 = $37,031.17 USD
Post ECM kWh         (24,597.2 Watts / 1,000) * 5,256 Annual Operating hrs = 129,282 kWh
Cost to Run After ECM         129,282 * $.2098 = $27,123.33 USD
Cost Savings per Year         ($37,031.17 - $27,123.33) = $9,907.84 USD
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® $6,174 USD
KwH Saving per Year         ($176,506 - 129,282) = 47,224 kWh
Environmental Impact of the Project         * 33.3 metric ton reduction of carbons dioxide emissions
*Emission factor calculated by 7.055 x 10 to the negative 4 metric tons Co2/KwH
