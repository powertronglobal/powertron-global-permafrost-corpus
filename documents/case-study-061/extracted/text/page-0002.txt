PermaFrost NMR® Performance Report
International Bank A
June 12, 2013 
Executive Summary
         This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure 
(ECM) PermaFrost NMR® in [Brazil Location] for International Bank A. Detailed forensic performance testing 
(outlined later in this report) was performed on 8 DX units ranging from 15 to 40 tons in size. It was 
determined to demonstrate the performance of the product in both administrative and branch type 
buildings.
Immediately following the baseline testing, all the units were treated with the proper amount and type of 
PermaFrost NMR® product formulated for R-22 DX and R-438A systems. Since there were no other ECM’s 
going on during this pilot project, the improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at the 
units is solely attributable to the PermaFrost NMR® ECM. The unit(s) now provide cooler/drier supply air 
while using less power. This greater operational efficiency is due to the restoration of the heat transfer 
ability of the evaporator and condenser coils.
