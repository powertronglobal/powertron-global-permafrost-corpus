The post DB temperature (72 vs. 72.7 deg. F) entering the coil was matched as close as possible to the 
baseline period. After matching this temperature the post readings were taken to ensure that the work the 
coil had to do was as similar to the baseline. The post amperage was also normalized for the OAT 
difference. The OAT or outdoor air temperature was 4.0% or 3 degrees F higher in the Energy Reporting 
Period (post). The Bitzer package unit #3 did not show maximum results because when we performed a 
survey of the overall operating performance of the unit he noticed it was low on refrigerant indicating a 
significant leak(s). The team installed 30 lbs of R-22 before the baseline was performed. PermaFrost NMR® 
was then installed. Upon return, to do the post analysis approximately 4 weeks later, more refrigerant had 
leaked out again. We had to install another 10 lbs of R-22 so in one month there was a notable release of 
refrigerant. The unit certainly showed significant improvements but the unit did not get the full exposure of 
PermaFrost NMR® due to this leak(s).
