Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following performance measurements were placed into the 
regression analysis to account for the restored capacity brought about by PermaFrost NMR® and to 
determine an accurate ROI for implementing this ECM:.
Regression Analysis 
Adjusted Base Tonnage         22.31 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted Total Watts         1,581 Watts per Ton * 22.31 tons = 35,272.1 Total Watts
Adjusted Base kWh         (35,272.1 Watts /1,000) * 1,482 Annual Operating hrs = 52,273 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM         52,273 kWh * $.2098 = $10,967 USD
Post ECM kWh         (14,892.7 Watts /1,000) * 1,482 Annual Operating hrs = 22,071 kWh
Cost to Run After ECM         22,071 kWh * $.2098 = $4,631 USD
Cost Savings per Year         ($10,967 - $4,631) = $6,336 USD
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® $4,116 USD
KwH Saving per Year         ($52,273 - 22,071) = 30,202 kWh
Environmental Impact of the Project         * 21.3 metric ton reduction of carbons dioxide emissions
*Emission factor calculated by 7.055 x 10 to the negative 4 metric tons Co2/KwH
