System Description / Design Characteristics
Baseline & Energy Reporting (Post) Periods
The baseline data was recorded on 4/9/13 using NIST calibrated devices to insure measurement accuracy. 
The following results were recorded as a result of the implementation of the IPMVP Protocol. The identical 
IPMVP data recordings from the baseline were recorded on 5/21/13 using the same NIST calibrated devices 
to insure measurement accuracy. The Energy Reporting Period measurements are as follows:
It was discovered that the Bitzer package unit #1 was low on refrigerant. It was evident that this unit had a 
leak(s). 10 lbs of R-22 gas was added to the unit in the post trip. The unit certainly showed significant 
improvements but the unit did not get the full exposure of PF due to this leak(s).
