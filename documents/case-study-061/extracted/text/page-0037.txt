Utilizing the data in the above charts, the following performance measurements were placed into the 
regression analysis to account for the restored capacity brought about by PermaFrost NMR® and to 
determine an accurate ROI for implementing this ECM:.
Regression Analysis 
Adjusted Base Tonnage         44.07 tons (equates to tonnage in ERP)
Adjusted Total Watts         897 Watts per Ton * 44.07 tons = 39,530.8 Watts
Adjusted Base kWh         (39,530.8 Watts /1,000) * 5,256 Annual Operating hrs = 207,775 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Prior to ECM         207,775 kWh * $.2098 = $43,590.08 USD
Post ECM kWh         (26,626.8 Watts / 1,000) * 5,256 Annual Operating hrs = 139,951 kWh
Cost to Run After ECM         139,951 kWh * $.2098 = $29,361.83 USD
Cost Savings per Year         ($43,590.08 - $29,361.83) = $14,228.25 USD
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® $8,232 USD
KwH Saving per Year         ($207,775 - 139,951) = 67,824 kWh
Environmental Impact of the Project         * 47.9 metric ton reduction of carbons dioxide emissions
*Emission factor calculated by 7.055 x 10 to the negative 4 metric tons Co2/KwH
