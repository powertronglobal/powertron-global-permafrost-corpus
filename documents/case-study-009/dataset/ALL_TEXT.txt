HVAC/R Eﬃciency Report
Purpose of Energy Eﬃciency Study
The purpose of this study is to verify the industry wide problem of efficiency loss in HVAC/R as projected by 
ASHRAE research and to quantify the amount of money wasted due to this loss. Many industry leading 
organizations, including ASHRAE, project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they 
age. Thermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVAC/R equipment that operates 
as a vapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is 
well documented by the HVAC/R industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal 
degradation prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times 
and additional kWh consumption.
The chiller in this study is representative of the portfolio of cooling equipment operated by Major US Telecom facilities 
throughout the country. If thermal degradation is present in this chiller, it is present in the entire inventory of 
equipment. Energy waste can be calculated based on this equipment (portfolio representation) and then 
accurately extrapolated across the entire inventory of equipment.
This study verifies the effectiveness of the PermaFrost NMR® Energy Conservation Measure (ECM) in Major US Telecom 
HVAC/R systems and documents the performance improvements and future energy cost reductions 
associated.

Process
This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure (ECM), 
PermaFrost NMR®, into one (1) air-cooled chiller located in [Midwest Location], WI. 
Detailed forensic performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on this unit, which is 
owned by Major US Telecom, to determine three key elements that should be considered as they relate with the original 
design specifications: 
 
1. The cooling capacity the chiller is capable of producing after 10 years in service.
 
2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the chiller is delivering as 
 
    reflected in the kW/ton measurement.
 
3. The thermal dynamic ability of the chiller to still perform at or close to operational design.
Following baseline testing, the unit was treated with the proper amount and type of the PermaFrost NMR® 
technology specially formulated for these types of systems.
Methodology
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the 
IPMVP (International Performance Measurement & Verification Protocol) framework. NIST calibrated devices 
were used for the highest level of accuracy and data integrity. IPMVP is the industry standard according to the 
US Department of Energy. Because of its wide international adoption, the IPMVP has been identified as the 
best Measurement and Verification Framework for helping to determine and secure financial compensation 
for emissions reductions resulting from Energy Conservation Methods (ECM).
Measurement and Verification (M&V) was conducted to establish an initial energy baseline and a post 
avoided energy-reporting period. The purpose of the testing was to show how the ECM improves the thermal 
performance of any system it is installed in.
The improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at each unit was solely attributable to 
PermaFrost NMR®. This is a result of the reversal of thermal inefficiency on the heat exchanger surfaces.

Energy Conservation Method (ECM)
The content within the following report demonstrates the ability of PermaFrost NMR® to correct the effects of 
thermal degradation and fouling on the heat exchange surfaces. 
 
A diagnostic examination of the pilot equipment was implemented to determine if the operational conditions 
of the systems were satisfactory. Baseline M&V was recorded on the unit and then the proper amount and 
type of PermaFrost NMR® was injected directly into the suction side of the refrigerant loop. The gestation 
period for the pilot was approximately 11 months due to an abnormally cold winter that resulted in cold lake 
temperatures not allowing the ambient temperature to get warm enough. The chiller has been running most of 
the summer, just not at full capacity due to very mild summer temperatures. At the end of this gestation 
period, Post M&V results were taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match 
the same outside air temperatures. The chiller comes on line when the ambient temperature is above 55 deg. 
There was not enough of a load on the building to keep the chiller running at 100% capacity long enough to 
take the post readings until late in the summer. Standard procedure is to match the ambient temperature from 
the baseline test. 
The results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:
 
• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) 
 
• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage 
 
• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)
 
• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU 
 
• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Water Temp – Saturated Evaporator Temp
Notes 
Pursuant to AHRI performance certification testing, air cooled chillers under 200 tons are categorized under standard 
testing protocols. Testing limits are set to 95 deg f entering air temperature for the air cooled condensers and 55 degree 
entering chilled water temperature. 
These standards are difficult to replicate in-situ therefore when these levels are either lower or higher then the standards 
capacity will be affected. An example is lower than 95 degree entering condenser air will produce cooler condensed liquid 
refrigerant temperature thereby creating additional capacity in BTU's. Conversely higher temperature will reduce this 
capacity. Identical result will occur when the entering chilled water temperature is either reduced or increased.

HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Major US Telecom Chiller Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
The air-cooled chiller had the problem of thermal degradation. The high kW/ton ratings measured on site are 
in line with the ASHRAE estimated loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. The degraded equipment 
performance was costing Major US Telecom significant money and wasting energy. The equipment was currently using 
significantly more kWh to operate than it used when it was new. 
The problem of thermal degradation affecting the chiller has been significantly corrected by installing the ECM 
PermaFrost NMR®. The degraded equipment performance has been restored. The chiller is using significantly 
less kWh to operate than before the ECM was implemented. This efficiency summary combines the baseline 
and post tonnage & coefficient of performance. This summary is the cumulative impact of the ECM’s 
performance on the treated process chiller.

Recovered Wasted Energy with PermaFrost NMR® - Chiller
The next chart illustrates the performance restoration 
PermaFrost NMR® created in the treated chiller. The 
average cost to operate the chiller before it was treated 
with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in kW/ton, was 
.97.
The specific cost to operate this chiller after it has been 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, is currently .81.
The baseline kW/ton ratings measured in-situ were expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimations for 10 year old equipment. The post results are also 
in line with the average improvement savings shown over more than 120,000 installations globally.
Cost to Major US Telecom for Lost Eﬃciency
Left unfixed, the chiller system with it's reduced level of performance is costing (in money) an additional 
16.5% than it would if it were running at the original design specification. Extrapolated across Major US Telecom's 
inventory of equipment, this presents a tremendous savings opportunity in reduced costs and lower 
energy consumption.

Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The below are the final calculated performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® Post 
measurement period for the Major US Telecom Chiller.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 79.6 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: .97 kW/ton * 95.6 tons = 92.7 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 92.7 kW * 5,000 Annual Operating Hrs = 463,500 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 463,500 kWh * $.09 = $41,715
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: .81 kW/ton * 95.6 tons = 77.4 kW
Annual kWh Post: 77.4 kW * 5,000 hours = 387,000 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 387,000 kWh * .09 cents = $34,830
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $41,715 - $34,830= $6,885
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $6,885 / 12 = $573
Initial Payback Period
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot chiller: $8,193
Estimated Payback Period for Chiller: $8,193 / $573 = 14.3 months
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 84%
Return on Investment Over 10 Years = 840.4%
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period 
for Major US Telecom for implementing the PermaFrost NMR®, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in the 
Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems was when operating at the original 
energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost 
to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® was installed. This regression analysis is 
the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the systems will now operate due to the 
restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the internal building set points with increased 
efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
