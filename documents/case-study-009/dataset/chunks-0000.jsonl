Many industry leading \norganizations, including ASHRAE, project that all HVAC/R units degrade in capacity and efficiency as they \nage. Thermal degradation is caused by a phenomenon that is present in all HVAC/R equipment that operates \nas a vapor compression cycle associated with refrigerant and compressor lubricant. This thermal degradation is \nwell documented by the HVAC/R industry and the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s). Thermal \ndegradation prevents units from operating at the original design efficiency, which leads to excessive run-times \nand additional kWh consumption.\nThe chiller in this study is representative of the portfolio of cooling equipment operated by Major US Telecom facilities \nthroughout the country. If thermal degradation is present in this chiller, it is present in the entire inventory of \nequipment. Energy waste can be calculated based on this equipment (portfolio representation) and then \naccurately extrapolated across the entire inventory of equipment.\nThis study verifies the effectiveness of the PermaFrost NMR® Energy Conservation Measure (ECM) in Major US Telecom \nHVAC/R systems and documents the performance improvements and future energy cost reductions \nassociated.\n1\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 547, "chars": 2674, "pages": {"start": 1, "end": 2}, "section": "", "prev_id": "", "next_id": "pdf_017_chunk_0002", "content_hash": "sha256:f5d9470f87ecab2f050661cd7d9177087ccffb6dc253bb2ce87707e49f39fb68"}

The cooling capacity the chiller is capable of producing after 10 years in service.\n \n2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the chiller is delivering as \n \n    reflected in the kW/ton measurement.\n \n3. The thermal dynamic ability of the chiller to still perform at or close to operational design.\nFollowing baseline testing, the unit was treated with the proper amount and type of the PermaFrost NMR® \ntechnology specially formulated for these types of systems.\nMethodology\nThe measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the \nIPMVP (International Performance Measurement & Verification Protocol) framework. NIST calibrated devices \nwere used for the highest level of accuracy and data integrity. IPMVP is the industry standard according to the \nUS Department of Energy. Because of its wide international adoption, the IPMVP has been identified as the \nbest Measurement and Verification Framework for helping to determine and secure financial compensation \nfor emissions reductions resulting from Energy Conservation Methods (ECM).\nMeasurement and Verification (M&V) was conducted to establish an initial energy baseline and a post \navoided energy-reporting period. The purpose of the testing was to show how the ECM improves the thermal \nperformance of any system it is installed in.\nThe improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at each unit was solely attributable to \nPermaFrost NMR®. This is a result of the reversal of thermal inefficiency on the heat exchanger surfaces.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 528, "chars": 2639, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_017_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_017_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:8e205f4429d236e721a166a2090d756fb1fc9de6edc5b19aee52fbd38cd4185e"}

Baseline M&V was recorded on the unit and then the proper amount and \ntype of PermaFrost NMR® was injected directly into the suction side of the refrigerant loop. The gestation \nperiod for the pilot was approximately 11 months due to an abnormally cold winter that resulted in cold lake \ntemperatures not allowing the ambient temperature to get warm enough. The chiller has been running most of \nthe summer, just not at full capacity due to very mild summer temperatures. At the end of this gestation \nperiod, Post M&V results were taken in the identical manner as in the baseline, taking special care to match \nthe same outside air temperatures. The chiller comes on line when the ambient temperature is above 55 deg. \nThere was not enough of a load on the building to keep the chiller running at 100% capacity long enough to \ntake the post readings until late in the summer. Standard procedure is to match the ambient temperature from \nthe baseline test. \nThe results were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic engineering formulas:\n \n• kW = Volts * Amps * Power Factor of 1.47/1000 (for 3-Phase) \n \n• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage \n \n• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)\n \n• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T / 12,000 BTU \n \n• Refrigerant Approach = Supply Water Temp – Saturated Evaporator Temp\nNotes \nPursuant to AHRI performance certification testing, air cooled chillers under 200 tons are categorized under standard \ntesting protocols. Testing limits are set to 95 deg f entering air temperature for the air cooled condensers and 55 degree \nentering chilled water temperature. \nThese standards are difficult to replicate in-situ therefore when these levels are either lower or higher then the standards \ncapacity will be affected. An example is lower than 95 degree entering condenser air will produce cooler condensed liquid \nrefrigerant temperature thereby creating additional capacity in BTU's. Conversely higher temperature will reduce this \ncapacity. Identical result will occur when the entering chilled water temperature is either reduced or increased.\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 672, "chars": 3120, "pages": {"start": 3, "end": 4}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_017_chunk_0002", "next_id": "pdf_017_chunk_0004", "content_hash": "sha256:7cb1323dec7f467841950db146e52c2172371232dae5120adad7f72455721804"}

The high kW/ton ratings measured on site are \nin line with the ASHRAE estimated loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. The degraded equipment \nperformance was costing Major US Telecom significant money and wasting energy. The equipment was currently using \nsignificantly more kWh to operate than it used when it was new. \nThe problem of thermal degradation affecting the chiller has been significantly corrected by installing the ECM \nPermaFrost NMR®. The degraded equipment performance has been restored. The chiller is using significantly \nless kWh to operate than before the ECM was implemented.

This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in the \nPost Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems was when operating at the original \nenergy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost \nto run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® was installed. This regression analysis is \nthe most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the systems will now operate due to the \nrestored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the internal building set points with increased \nefficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.\n6\nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 613, "chars": 2520, "pages": {"start": 6, "end": 7}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_017_chunk_0005", "next_id": "pdf_017_chunk_0007", "content_hash": "sha256:2c819dc4c39bb034809f60db61adbf4aba4471e3a5cc5a08e05693622573b76c"}
