Process
This report contains specific information regarding the installation of the energy control measure (ECM), 
PermaFrost NMR®, into one (1) air-cooled chiller located in [Midwest Location], WI. 
Detailed forensic performance testing (outlined later in this report) was performed on this unit, which is 
owned by Major US Telecom, to determine three key elements that should be considered as they relate with the original 
design specifications: 
 
1. The cooling capacity the chiller is capable of producing after 10 years in service.
 
2. The actual cost of power required to produce the amount of cooling tons the chiller is delivering as 
 
    reflected in the kW/ton measurement.
 
3. The thermal dynamic ability of the chiller to still perform at or close to operational design.
Following baseline testing, the unit was treated with the proper amount and type of the PermaFrost NMR® 
technology specially formulated for these types of systems.
Methodology
The measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and compiled in accordance with the 
IPMVP (International Performance Measurement & Verification Protocol) framework. NIST calibrated devices 
were used for the highest level of accuracy and data integrity. IPMVP is the industry standard according to the 
US Department of Energy. Because of its wide international adoption, the IPMVP has been identified as the 
best Measurement and Verification Framework for helping to determine and secure financial compensation 
for emissions reductions resulting from Energy Conservation Methods (ECM).
Measurement and Verification (M&V) was conducted to establish an initial energy baseline and a post 
avoided energy-reporting period. The purpose of the testing was to show how the ECM improves the thermal 
performance of any system it is installed in.
The improvement in efficiency and restored capacity gained directly at each unit was solely attributable to 
PermaFrost NMR®. This is a result of the reversal of thermal inefficiency on the heat exchanger surfaces.
