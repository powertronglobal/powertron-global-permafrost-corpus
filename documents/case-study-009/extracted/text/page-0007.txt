Energy Consumption & Financial Metrics
The below are the final calculated performance measurements following the PermaFrost NMR® Post 
measurement period for the Major US Telecom Chiller.
Baseline Energy Consumption
Baseline Tonnage: 79.6 tons
Adjusted kW Baseline: .97 kW/ton * 95.6 tons = 92.7 kW
Adjusted Baseline kWh: 92.7 kW * 5,000 Annual Operating Hrs = 463,500 kWh
Revised Cost to Run Baseline: 463,500 kWh * $.09 = $41,715
Post Energy Consumption
kW Post: .81 kW/ton * 95.6 tons = 77.4 kW
Annual kWh Post: 77.4 kW * 5,000 hours = 387,000 kWh
Annual Cost Post: 387,000 kWh * .09 cents = $34,830
Savings Per Year
Avoided Energy Cost (savings) Per Year: $41,715 - $34,830= $6,885
Estimated Energy Savings Per Month: $6,885 / 12 = $573
Initial Payback Period
Cost of PermaFrost NMR® installed in the pilot chiller: $8,193
Estimated Payback Period for Chiller: $8,193 / $573 = 14.3 months
Annual Internal Rate of Return = 84%
Return on Investment Over 10 Years = 840.4%
Utilizing data in the charts on the previous pages, to obtain a true avoided energy cost and subsequent payback period 
for Major US Telecom for implementing the PermaFrost NMR®, a detailed Regression Analysis is used to calculate the true energy 
savings resulting from the improvement in capacity. This increased capacity reduces the annual kWh expended in the 
Post Analysis Period. ROI comes from determining what the cost to run the systems was when operating at the original 
energy profile to produce the newly restored amount of available tonnage capacity and then subtracting the revised cost 
to run the systems at the same restored tonnage after the PermaFrostNMR® was installed. This regression analysis is 
the most widely accepted method of accounting for the reduced number of hours the systems will now operate due to the 
restored capacity. This restored capacity allows the systems to reach the internal building set points with increased 
efficiency resulting in reduced compressor demand loading.
