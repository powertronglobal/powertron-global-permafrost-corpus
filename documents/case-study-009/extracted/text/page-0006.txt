Recovered Wasted Energy with PermaFrost NMR® - Chiller
The next chart illustrates the performance restoration 
PermaFrost NMR® created in the treated chiller. The 
average cost to operate the chiller before it was treated 
with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in kW/ton, was 
.97.
The specific cost to operate this chiller after it has been 
treated with PermaFrost NMR®, as calculated in 
kW/ton, is currently .81.
The baseline kW/ton ratings measured in-situ were expected when compared to the ASHRAE loss of 
performance efficiency and cost to operate estimations for 10 year old equipment. The post results are also 
in line with the average improvement savings shown over more than 120,000 installations globally.
Cost to Major US Telecom for Lost Eﬃciency
Left unfixed, the chiller system with it's reduced level of performance is costing (in money) an additional 
16.5% than it would if it were running at the original design specification. Extrapolated across Major US Telecom's 
inventory of equipment, this presents a tremendous savings opportunity in reduced costs and lower 
energy consumption.
