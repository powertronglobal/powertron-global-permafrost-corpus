HVAC/R Eﬃciency Study Results
Major US Telecom Chiller Eﬃciency with PermaFrost NMR® ECM
The air-cooled chiller had the problem of thermal degradation. The high kW/ton ratings measured on site are 
in line with the ASHRAE estimated loss of performance and cost to operate numbers. The degraded equipment 
performance was costing Major US Telecom significant money and wasting energy. The equipment was currently using 
significantly more kWh to operate than it used when it was new. 
The problem of thermal degradation affecting the chiller has been significantly corrected by installing the ECM 
PermaFrost NMR®. The degraded equipment performance has been restored. The chiller is using significantly 
less kWh to operate than before the ECM was implemented. This efficiency summary combines the baseline 
and post tonnage & coefficient of performance. This summary is the cumulative impact of the ECM’s 
performance on the treated process chiller.
