Nanotechnology Fact Sheet 
PermaFrost NMR® 
Our Nucleo Molecular Regenerative® is a nanotechnology chemical formulation that is 
injected into operating HVAC units. Over the course of 300 runtime hours the chemical 
reaction is complete having displace molecular debris from metal surfaces and substrate. In 
addition, the process creates a permanent bond to the metal preventing oil migration from 
recurring as the machine’s heat transfer properties return to ~OEM design cooling 
specification. 
•
ASHRAE finds all HVAC systems lose 20%-30% of cooling efficiency within 5-10
years
•
PermaFrost NMR® permanently restores efficiency loss in ~300 runtime hours
•
kW/ton or EER is returned to (or near) OEM design efficiency in all types of HVAC
•
Re-commissioning (TAB) optimizes savings typically, 15%-40% of HVAC portion of
bill
•
Deployment in new systems fully protects from thermal degradation over life of the
unit
•
Other benefits: fewer repairs, longer useful life, significant sustainability gains
ROI 
•
Typically, < 24 months
•
< 12 months in HVAC-intense data centers, manufacturing, labs, etc.
Confirmatory Testing 
•
UL
•
Florida Atlantic University (FAU)
•
M&V platform: ASHRAE nominated “breakthrough technology of 2017”
•
7M pre-post comparative data points substantiating kW/ton reductions (and EER)
