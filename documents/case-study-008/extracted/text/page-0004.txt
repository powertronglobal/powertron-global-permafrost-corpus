Improved Unit Cost 
The “Unit Cost” in the HVAC industry is the kW/ton ratio. KW/ton is commonly used for larger 
commercial and industrial air conditioning, heat pump and refrigeration systems. It is the HVAC industry’s 
standard of determining how much energy is required to create a single ton of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). 
When you reduce your unit cost of cooling you are saving energy regardless of how much overall cooling 
you require.
The chart to the right clearly illustrates the 
amount of efficiency restoration the ECM created 
in the pilot system four weeks after installation. 
The treated pilot system is now performing 15.6% 
more efficiently than before being treated. This 
degradation in operational efficiency was costing 
the stadium a substantial amount of money in 
wasted energy.
