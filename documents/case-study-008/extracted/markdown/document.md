Study Summary

This report details the results of the recently completed comprehensive energy performance study conducted

on a water-cooled system located in the Major US Telecom/Major Sports Venue in Arlington, TX.

The study was conducted from July 21, 2014 to January 8, 2016, the pilot was designed to illustrate the positive

impact the PermaFrost NMR® energy control measure (ECM) would have on the overall cooling performance

of a water-cooled system supporting the stadium.

As demonstrated in this field trial, PermaFrost NMR® restores the capacity lost over time due to fouling of the

heat exchange surfaces. This improvement in thermal performance will manifest itself in any or all of the

following ways:

• The cooling capacity of the chiller produces after 6 years in service, before and after the

administration of the ECM.

• Improved system efficiency, lowering cost to produce each ton of cooling required (i.e., kW/ton)

• Restored thermal dynamic ability of the chiller to perform in relation to the operational design,

before and after the administration of the ECM therefore reducing runtime and extending

equipment life by 15%+.

The improvements demonstrated in this or any field test resulting from PermaFrost NMR® are dependent on

factors such as age, condition, service history, runtime of the compressor and the design and application of

each system. The results in this pilot were very consistent with 10 to 6-year historical performance averages.

The identiﬁcation of pilot chiller involved in the study is recorded as follows:

Nominal 970 - Ton York Chiller, Mfg. Date: 2009, R-134, 208 volt-3 Phase, Model YKKKKKH-CZFS  Serial EPR-131

ECM Product Brief

PermaFrost NMR® is a multi-patented surface science nanotechnology that uses Nucleo Molecular

Regenerative (NMR®) technology as its core agent. A sustainable, one-time treatment with no down time

required, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type of climate control system in which it is

installed.  The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling efficiency and restored capacity, both

of which result in lower overall costs to operate a system and extended equipment life.

Methodology

After verifying the proper rates of water flowing through the chiller evaporator and condenser barrels before

beginning the pilot, the subsequent measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and

compiled in accordance with Option B of the IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol)

framework and AHRI standard 550/590.

The results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic

engineering formulas:

• kW = Volts * Amps * .88 * 1.732 / 1000 (for 3-Phase)

• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage

• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)

• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = (Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T) / 12,000 BTU

Notes

Following a diagnostic examination to determine the operational condition of the chiller was satisfactory, Baseline M&V

data was collected and recorded by the M&V team. 350+ runtime hours after installation of the ECM, the M&V team

returned on a very similar weather day to the Baseline to take Post M&V measurements in the identical fashion as in the

baseline. The delta of these measurements and associated calculations show the amount of capacity restored.

The GPM was recorded on Jul 14, 2014 using an instrument recently calibrated under the constraints of the National

Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to insure accurate flow measurements through the evaporator. The

remaining measurements were taken directly from the chiller’s control panel. The chiller was then treated with with

PermaFrost NMR® on Dec 9, 2015 and allowed to run normally until Jan 8, 2016 to ensure the technology had ample

time to seat into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All measurements were taken at nearly identical incoming

water temperatures.

Improved Unit Cost

The “Unit Cost” in the HVAC industry is the kW/ton ratio. KW/ton is commonly used for larger

commercial and industrial air conditioning, heat pump and refrigeration systems. It is the HVAC industry’s

standard of determining how much energy is required to create a single ton of cooling (i.e., conditioned air).

When you reduce your unit cost of cooling you are saving energy regardless of how much overall cooling

you require.

The chart to the right clearly illustrates the

amount of efficiency restoration the ECM created

in the pilot system four weeks after installation.

The treated pilot system is now performing 15.6%

more efficiently than before being treated. This

degradation in operational efficiency was costing

the stadium a substantial amount of money in

wasted energy.
