This improvement in thermal performance will manifest itself in any or all of the \nfollowing ways:\n• The cooling capacity of the chiller produces after 6 years in service, before and after the \nadministration of the ECM.\n• Improved system efficiency, lowering cost to produce each ton of cooling required (i.e., kW/ton)     \n• Restored thermal dynamic ability of the chiller to perform in relation to the operational design, \nbefore and after the administration of the ECM therefore reducing runtime and extending \nequipment life by 15%+.\nThe improvements demonstrated in this or any field test resulting from PermaFrost NMR® are dependent on \nfactors such as age, condition, service history, runtime of the compressor and the design and application of \neach system. The results in this pilot were very consistent with 10 to 6-year historical performance averages.\nThe identiﬁcation of pilot chiller involved in the study is recorded as follows:\nNominal 970 - Ton York Chiller, Mfg.

A sustainable, one-time treatment with no down time \nrequired, PermaFrost NMR® lasts for the remaining life of any type of climate control system in which it is \ninstalled.  The direct benefits of PermaFrost NMR® are improved cooling efficiency and restored capacity, both \nof which result in lower overall costs to operate a system and extended equipment life. \nMethodology\nAfter verifying the proper rates of water flowing through the chiller evaporator and condenser barrels before \nbeginning the pilot, the subsequent measurements used in the efficiency calculations were collected and \ncompiled in accordance with Option B of the IPMVP (International Measurement and Verification Protocol) \nframework and AHRI standard 550/590.\nThe results presented below were formulated by entering the data into the following thermodynamic \nengineering formulas:\n \n• kW = Volts * Amps * .88 * 1.732 / 1000 (for 3-Phase)\n \n• kW/Ton = kW / Actual Tonnage \n \n• Coefficient of Performance (COP) = (12 / kW per ton /3.412)\n \n• Actual Cooling Tons per Hour = (Evaporator GPM X 8.34 * 60 * Chilled Water Delta T) / 12,000 BTU\nNotes\nFollowing a diagnostic examination to determine the operational condition of the chiller was satisfactory, Baseline M&V \ndata was collected and recorded by the M&V team. 350+ runtime hours after installation of the ECM, the M&V team \nreturned on a very similar weather day to the Baseline to take Post M&V measurements in the identical fashion as in the \nbaseline. The delta of these measurements and associated calculations show the amount of capacity restored.\nThe GPM was recorded on Jul 14, 2014 using an instrument recently calibrated under the constraints of the National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to insure accurate flow measurements through the evaporator. The \nremaining measurements were taken directly from the chiller’s control panel. The chiller was then treated with with \nPermaFrost NMR® on Dec 9, 2015 and allowed to run normally until Jan 8, 2016 to ensure the technology had ample \ntime to seat into all the metal surfaces of the heat exchangers. All measurements were taken at nearly identical incoming \nwater temperatures. \nPlease be aware that our companies have a non-disclosure agreement in place and this document is covered under that agreement and the terms of use on our website. \nThis document is not to be distributed to any third party and is not to be in the public domain without our written approval. © Copyright 2016 Powertron Global, LLC.", "tokens": 673, "chars": 2974, "pages": {"start": 2, "end": 3}, "section": "", "prev_id": "pdf_016_chunk_0001", "next_id": "pdf_016_chunk_0003", "content_hash": "sha256:3bff5b77bf291f97d3379ed936927062106f2098d19900b6b86d0796fd9e5179"}

KW/ton is commonly used for larger \ncommercial and industrial air conditioning, heat pump and refrigeration systems. It is the HVAC industry’s \nstandard of determining how much energy is required to create a single ton of cooling (i.e., conditioned air). \nWhen you reduce your unit cost of cooling you are saving energy regardless of how much overall cooling \nyou require.\nThe chart to the right clearly illustrates the \namount of efficiency restoration the ECM created \nin the pilot system four weeks after installation. \nThe treated pilot system is now performing 15.6% \nmore efficiently than before being treated.
