      "ground_truth": "HVAC Equipment Manufacturer's US Patent 6564560B2 explicitly states the goal is to 'eliminate the oil-coating of heat exchange surfaces and the resulting diminishment of the heat transfer process.' This proves the industry recognizes oil fouling as a real efficiency problem. However, HVAC Equipment Manufacturer's solution requires new equipment ($1,500-3,000/ton) while PermaFrost treats existing equipment ($125/ton).",

      "question": "What does a negative R² value in the UMontana ML study mean?",
      "ground_truth": "A negative R² value (like -0.016 for EER in the 500-hour window) means the regression model performs WORSE than simply predicting the mean value. This occurred during the system transition period after treatment, indicating the model could not reliably predict efficiency during this adjustment phase.",

      "question": "Should PermaFrost NMR be applied to a brand new 6-month-old chiller? Why or why not?",
      "ground_truth": "YES - Preventive treatment is recommended for new equipment. While immediate measured improvement will be low (5-15%), the treatment prevents the 30-40% efficiency loss that ASHRAE documents will occur over the equipment's lifetime. Preventive treatment yields ~739% lifetime ROI for chillers vs ~368% for restorative treatment on aged equipment.",

      "question": "I have a brand new 500-ton standard centrifugal chiller installed 2 months ago. Since it's new, should I wait until efficiency drops before installing PermaFrost?",
      "ground_truth": "No, you should not wait. While immediate efficiency improvement will be minimal (<5%), installing PermaFrost on new equipment is recommended as a 'Preventative' measure. It locks in 'Day 1' efficiency and prevents the typical 1.5-2% annual degradation caused by oil fouling, yielding high Net Present Value (NPV) through avoided energy waste.",

      "question": "We just commissioned a new plant with Danfoss Turbocor magnetic bearing chillers. Can we use PermaFrost to improve their performance?",
      "ground_truth": "No. PermaFrost is not compatible with or beneficial for magnetic bearing (Turbocor) chillers. The technology works specifically by removing oil fouling from heat transfer surfaces. Since magnetic bearing chillers are oil-free systems, there is no oil fouling to address.",

      "category": "limitations",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "question": "If I double the recommended dosage of PermaFrost, will I get double the efficiency savings?",
      "ground_truth": "No. Overdosing is a critical risk. Exceeding the specified dosage (10% of oil volume for chillers, 1 oz/ton for DX) can negatively impact oil viscosity, cause foaming, and actually REDUCE heat transfer efficiency. 'More' is not better; precise dosing is required. Up to 2x is safe but provides no additional benefit.",

      "difficulty": "hard",
      "question": "How do the FAU academic study results compare to the corpus-wide PE-certified average?",
      "ground_truth": "The FAU study showed 27% mean efficiency improvement across 61 tests at 38 sites, which is slightly higher than the corpus-wide average of 23.2%. This is consistent since FAU testing included older equipment with more oil fouling potential.",

      "difficulty": "hard",
      "question": "What is the relationship between ASHRAE's documented efficiency degradation rates and PermaFrost NMR's improvement claims?",
      "ground_truth": "ASHRAE documents that oil fouling causes 7% efficiency loss in year 1, 5% in year 2, and 2% per year thereafter, potentially up to 30% over equipment lifetime. PermaFrost NMR's average 23.2% improvement aligns with restoring this lost efficiency by removing the oil layer causing thermal insulation.",

      "ground_truth": "The Major Bank B study showed 22% capacity restored and 23.7% COP improvement with an 11-month payback and 547% 5-year ROI. This is very close to the corpus average of 23.2%, making it a representative example of typical results.",

      "ground_truth": "The Major Global Bank A longevity study tracked performance for 6+ years and showed 17.76% COP improvement sustained throughout the entire period with no degradation and no reapplication. Additional longevity studies from Restaurant Chain A and QSR Chain A also showed continued performance over multiple years.",
