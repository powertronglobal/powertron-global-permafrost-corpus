  "version": "1.0.0",
  "last_updated": "2025-12-28",
  "purpose": "Address common sales objections with evidence-based responses",
  "objections": {
    "too_good_to_be_true": {
      "objection": "20-30% efficiency improvement sounds too good to be true",
      "response": "This is RESTORATION of lost efficiency, not improvement beyond design. All HVAC systems lose 20-30% efficiency over time due to oil fouling (documented by ASHRAE RP-751). We're returning the equipment to its original nameplate performance, not exceeding it.",
      "evidence": [
        "ASHRAE research documents 20-30% efficiency loss in all systems",
        "254 PE-certified field measurements confirm 23.2% mean improvement",
        "6 independent labs in 2 countries validated results"
      ]
    },
    "snake_oil": {
      "objection": "This sounds like snake oil / magic in a bottle",
      "response": "The science is straightforward: oil contaminates heat exchangers, creating a thermal barrier. Our nanotechnology displaces that oil and protects the surface. Major OEMs like HVAC Equipment Manufacturer developed oil-free compressors (Patent US6564560B2) specifically to avoid this problem - proving the problem is real.",
      "evidence": [
        "HVAC Equipment Manufacturer patent explicitly states goal of 'eliminating oil-coating of heat exchange surfaces'",
        "UL verified our testing methodology, not just results",
        "US Government/Military validated at 5 facilities"
      ]
    },
    "never_heard_of_it": {
      "objection": "I've been in HVAC for 20 years and never heard of this",
      "response": "Most technicians aren't trained on efficiency degradation - they focus on 'is it working?' not 'how efficiently?' ASHRAE research on oil fouling exists but isn't part of standard trade school curricula. That's why we have 254 PE-certified measurements proving results.",
      "evidence": [
        "ASHRAE RP-751 and RP-601 document the problem",
        "15+ years in business, 300,000+ deployments",
        "Fortune 500 customers including Major Telecom A, Major Telecom B, Major Global Bank A, Retail Chain A"
      ]
    },
    "will_it_damage_equipment": {
      "objection": "Will this damage my equipment or void the warranty?",
      "response": "300,000+ deployments across 38 countries with ZERO damage claims. We carry $2M insurance per machine from a Fortune 500 carrier. The product does not void OEM warranties.",
      "evidence": [
        "Zero damage claims in company history",
        "$2M insurance coverage per machine",
        "Loss of revenue coverage included"
      ]
    },
    "my_equipment_is_new": {
      "objection": "My equipment is new, it doesn't need this",
      "response": "New equipment benefits from PREVENTION of future degradation. Major Appliance Mfg A tested a brand-new Frigidaire unit and still measured 47.6% Delta T improvement. Treatment protects efficiency over the equipment's entire life.",
      "evidence": [
        "Major Appliance Mfg A OEM testing on new equipment",
        "Major OEM Electronics A manufacturing line testing showed 2.93% EER improvement on new units"
      ]
    },
    "my_equipment_is_too_old": {
      "objection": "My equipment is too old for this to help",
      "response": "Older equipment often shows the BEST results because it has more accumulated oil contamination to remove. We've treated equipment up to 27 years old successfully. The treatment restores what was lost.",
      "evidence": [
        "Equipment age range in studies: 1-27 years",
        "Average equipment age: 10.4 years",
        "Older equipment shows larger improvements"
      ]
    },
    "just_replace_equipment": {
      "objection": "We should just replace the equipment instead",
      "response": "Equipment replacement costs $1,500-3,000 per ton with 10-20 year payback. PermaFrost NMR costs $125 per ton with 7-16 month payback. Treat first, then if replacement is still needed, the new equipment will also benefit from treatment.",
      "evidence": [
        "12-24x cost difference ($125 vs $1,500-3,000 per ton)",
        "Payback: 7-16 months vs 10-20 years",
        "Zero downtime vs weeks of installation"
      ]
    },
    "regular_maintenance_is_enough": {
      "objection": "We do regular maintenance - that should keep efficiency up",
      "response": "Regular maintenance (filters, coil cleaning) addresses EXTERNAL issues. Oil fouling is INSIDE the refrigerant circuit where maintenance cannot reach. Only a chemical treatment circulating through the system can address internal contamination.",
      "evidence": [
        "Oil accumulates on internal heat exchanger surfaces",
        "External cleaning cannot remove internal oil film",
        "Technicians cannot see efficiency loss without measurement"
      ]
    },
    "no_budget": {
      "objection": "We don't have budget for this",
      "response": "With 7-16 month payback, the treatment pays for itself quickly. We offer shared savings programs (ThEOS) with no upfront cost - we share 50/50 in the savings. Also, treatment qualifies as CapEx for favorable accounting.",
      "evidence": [
        "Shared savings program available",
        "CapEx accounting treatment",
        "ROI typically 400-600% over 5 years"
      ]
    },
    "need_to_see_proof": {
      "objection": "I need to see proof this works",
      "response": "We have 254 PE-certified measurements, 6 independent lab validations, 5 US Government/Military installations, and a 225-page FAU academic study. We can also do a pilot on your equipment with before/after measurement.",
      "evidence": [

    "refrigerant_compatibility": {
      "objection": "Will this work with my refrigerant type?",
      "response": "PermaFrost NMR is compatible with ALL refrigerant groups (I, II, III) and both mineral and synthetic oils. We have 5 formulations to match your specific system. Tested per API, ASHRAE, AHRI, ASTM, EPA, ANSI, and UL standards.",
      "evidence": [
        "Texas Oiltech Laboratories compatibility testing",
        "Field validated: R-22, R-410A, R-134A, R-123, R-407C, R-438A",
        "UL Refrigeration Lubricant Recognition Program certified"
      ]
    },
    "weather_load_skepticism": {
      "objection": "The savings are probably just due to lower load or cooler weather during the post-test",
      "response": "Our verification methodology eliminates that variable. All dataset comparisons are strictly controlled: we either compare 'Exact Matching Conditions' (identical load/temperature bins) or use ASHRAE-compliant regression analysis to normalize the data. This ensures the measured improvement is purely mechanical (efficiency restoration), not environmental.",
      "evidence": [
        "IPMVP Option B methodology requires condition matching or normalization",
        "F2 FMV platform tracks outdoor air temperature, humidity, and load continuously",
        "PE certification validates the normalization approach meets engineering standards",
        "US Patent 11,062,404 covers enthalpy-based measurement that isolates mechanical efficiency from environmental variables"
      ],
      "technical_detail": "The patented methodology calculates 'normalized post-treatment efficacy' by regressing performance against outdoor conditions. This isolates the true mechanical improvement from weather/load noise."
    },
    "modern_equipment_objection": {
      "objection": "My equipment is new with modern POE oil - it doesn't foul like old systems",
      "response": "Actually, modern high-efficiency equipment is MORE vulnerable to oil fouling, not less. High fin density and micro-channel heat exchanger designs maximize surface area for heat transfer - but this also means they're more sensitive to the insulating effects of oil boundary layers. Even a thin oil film on these complex surfaces causes significant heat transfer degradation. Prevention treatment is MORE critical on modern equipment.",
      "evidence": [
        "High fin density designs have 2-3x the surface area of older heat exchangers",
        "Major Appliance Mfg A tested brand-new equipment and measured 47.6% Delta T improvement",
        "Major OEM Electronics A tested units off the assembly line showing 2.93% EER improvement",
