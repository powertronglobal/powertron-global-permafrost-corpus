  "primary_misconception": {
    "myth": "PermaFrost NMR improves equipment beyond original design specifications",
    "reality": "PermaFrost NMR RESTORES equipment to original design efficiency - it does not improve beyond OEM specifications",
    "explanation": "All HVAC equipment loses efficiency over time due to oil contamination of heat exchangers. PermaFrost NMR removes this contamination and restores the system to the efficiency it had when new.",
    "key_distinction": "Restoration vs. Enhancement - the technology brings equipment BACK to design, not above it"

  "industry_knowledge_gaps": {
    "gap_1": {
      "misconception": "HVAC equipment maintains its rated efficiency throughout its life",
      "reality": "All HVAC systems lose 20-30% efficiency within 5-10 years due to oil fouling",
      "why_unknown": "ASHRAE research documenting this is not widely taught in trade schools or OEM training",
      "evidence": "ASHRAE RP-751 and RP-601 research projects quantified this efficiency loss"
    },
    "gap_2": {
      "misconception": "The tonnage on the nameplate is the tonnage being produced",
      "reality": "Actual cooling capacity degrades significantly below nameplate rating over time",
      "why_unknown": "Field technicians rarely measure actual capacity - they check pressures, temps, and assume system is at rated capacity",
      "example": "A '10-ton' unit that's 10 years old may only be producing 7-8 tons of actual cooling"
    },
    "gap_3": {
      "misconception": "If the system is running and cooling, it's operating efficiently",
      "reality": "A system can cool the space while using 30-50% more energy than necessary",
      "why_unknown": "Comfort is achieved, so no problem is perceived - the excess energy consumption is invisible",
      "impact": "Buildings pay 30-50% more in energy costs than necessary for HVAC"
    },
    "gap_4": {
      "misconception": "Efficiency is only measured in labs, not in the field",
      "reality": "IPMVP Option B methodology enables accurate field measurement of actual efficiency",
      "why_unknown": "Most service technicians are not trained in M&V protocols",
      "solution": "PE-certified measurements using Powertron Global's patented methodology prove actual performance"

    "training_gaps": [
      "Trade schools focus on installation and repair, not efficiency measurement",

    "new_equipment_doesnt_need_it": {
      "myth": "Brand new equipment doesn't need treatment",
      "reality": "New equipment benefits from PREVENTION of future efficiency loss",

    "regular_maintenance_prevents_this": {
      "myth": "Regular maintenance keeps equipment at peak efficiency",
      "reality": "Standard maintenance (filter changes, coil cleaning) does not address internal oil fouling",
      "explanation": "Oil contamination is INSIDE the refrigerant circuit - external maintenance cannot remove it"
    },
    "refrigerant_charge_is_the_issue": {
      "myth": "Low efficiency means refrigerant is low or wrong",
      "reality": "Oil fouling causes efficiency loss even with perfect refrigerant charge",

  "understanding_high_improvements": {
    "context": "Some field studies show 100-160% COP improvement, which may appear suspicious without context",

        "example_2": "Cultural Institution A: baseline COP 1.90 → post 4.95 (161.1% improvement)",
        "interpretation": "These systems were operating at ~50% of design efficiency due to 13-15 years of oil fouling"
      }
    },
    "critical_point": "A 150% COP improvement does NOT mean the system now performs 150% better than design - it means the system was restored FROM 50% of design TO near-design efficiency",
    "analogy": "If a car designed to get 30 MPG is only getting 15 MPG due to a clogged fuel filter, fixing the filter 'improves' fuel economy by 100% - but the car is now just performing as designed",
