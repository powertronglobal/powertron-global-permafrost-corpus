      "question": "Why would I treat new equipment if it only shows 10% improvement?",
      "answer": "The 10% improvement represents the existing baseline degradation (even new equipment has some oil distribution losses). But the real value is PREVENTIVE - you're locking in near-design efficiency for the equipment's entire 23-year life. Without treatment, that same chiller will lose 25-30% efficiency over time. The $25,000 treatment cost saves over $200,000 in prevented energy waste.",
