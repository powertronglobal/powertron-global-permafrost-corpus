        "question": "What causes HVAC systems to lose efficiency over time?",
        "answer": "Compressor oil migrates into refrigerant lines and coats heat exchanger surfaces. This oil layer acts as a thermal insulator, reducing heat transfer. ASHRAE research (RP-751, RP-601) documents that even 1-2% oil concentration can reduce heat transfer coefficient by 33%, and 5-15% oil content causes 40-50% reduction. The 1998 ASHRAE Handbook (Chapter 2.9) states oil fouling causes 7% loss the first year, 5% the second year, and 2% per year thereafter - up to 30% degradation over the equipment lifetime."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is oil fouling in HVAC systems a real problem recognized by the industry?",
        "answer": "Yes, it is extensively documented. ASHRAE Handbooks (1986, 1998, 2010) all address oil management as a critical issue. Research projects RP-751 and RP-601 quantified the heat transfer degradation. Major OEMs like HVAC Equipment Manufacturer have even patented 'oil-free' chiller designs (US Patent 6564560B2) specifically to eliminate this problem - proving the industry recognizes oil fouling as a significant efficiency drain."
      },
      {
        "question": "What percentage of commercial building energy does HVAC consume?",
        "answer": "HVAC systems account for 34-50% of total energy consumption in commercial buildings, depending on building type and climate. DOE and EIA data show 34-40% on average, while some industry studies report up to 50% for certain building types. This makes HVAC the single largest energy consumer in most commercial buildings."
