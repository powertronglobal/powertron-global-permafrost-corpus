      "what_is_permafrost_nmr": {
        "question": "What is PermaFrost NMR?",
        "answer": "PermaFrost NMR (Nucleo Molecular Regenerative) is a patented nanotechnology treatment that restores HVAC/R system efficiency by removing oil contamination from heat exchanger surfaces. It's a one-time treatment that lasts the life of the equipment."
      },
      "how_does_it_work": {
        "question": "How does it work?",
        "answer": "The treatment is injected into the refrigerant circuit while the system runs. Nano-particles displace oil molecules trapped on metal heat exchanger surfaces and create a permanent protective coating that restores thermal conductivity. Full effect is achieved in approximately 300 runtime hours."
      },
      "is_it_proven": {
        "question": "Is this technology proven?",
        "answer": "Yes. 254 PE-certified field measurements, 6 independent laboratory validations (UL, FAU, China National Lab A, Major Appliance Mfg A, Major OEM Electronics A, NSF), 5 US Government/Military installations, and 300,000+ deployments across 38 countries over 15+ years."

      "how_much_product": {
        "question": "How much product is needed?",
        "answer": "DX systems: 1 ounce per ton of cooling capacity. Chillers: 10% of total oil charge. Treatment is safe within 5% of calculated amount."
      },
      "how_long_installation": {
        "question": "How long does installation take?",
        "answer": "Minutes per unit. Product is injected through the refrigerant service port while the system is running. Zero downtime required."
      }
    },
    "performance": {
      "how_much_improvement": {
        "question": "How much efficiency improvement can I expect?",
        "answer": "Typical results: 20-30% efficiency improvement (mean: 23.2% across 254 measurements). Results vary based on equipment age, condition, and degree of oil contamination. Older, more degraded equipment often shows larger improvements."
      },
      "how_long_to_see_results": {
        "question": "How long until I see results?",
        "answer": "Full effect is achieved in approximately 300 runtime hours as the treatment circulates and coats all heat exchanger surfaces. Some improvement is immediate."
      },
      "how_long_does_it_last": {
        "question": "How long does the treatment last?",
        "answer": "Permanent. The treatment creates a lasting bond with metal surfaces. No reapplication is needed for the life of the equipment."
      },
      "new_equipment": {
        "question": "Does new equipment benefit from treatment?",
        "answer": "Yes. New equipment benefits from PREVENTION of future oil contamination. Major Appliance Mfg A tested a brand-new Frigidaire unit and measured 47.6% Delta T improvement. Treatment protects efficiency over the equipment's entire life."
      }
    },
    "business": {
      "how_much_cost": {
        "question": "How much does it cost?",
        "answer": "$125 per ton of cooling capacity (2025 USD). A 10-ton RTU costs $1,250 to treat. Volume discounts available for orders over 10,000 ounces."
      },
      "what_is_payback": {
        "question": "What is the typical payback period?",
        "answer": "7-16 months for most applications. Large chillers can achieve payback in under 1 month. Data centers and 24/7 operations see faster payback due to high runtime hours."
      },
      "what_is_roi": {
        "question": "What ROI can I expect?",
        "answer": "Typical 5-year ROI: 400-600%. Documented examples: Major Bank B 547%, Major Global Bank A 584%. First-year ROI often exceeds 100%."
      },
      "financing_options": {
